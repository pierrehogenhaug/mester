and

    - either you or any customers you represent are:


-----

(i) QIB(s); or

(ii) (a) non-U.S. persons outside the United States and (b) the e-mail address that you gave us
and to which the offering memorandum has been delivered is not located in the United
States, its territories and possessions (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands,

Prospective purchasers who are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes offered under the

Act pursuant to Rule 144A.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are
a person into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the
laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering
Memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an
offer or solicitation in any place in which offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction
requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the
Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by
the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuers (as defined herein) in such jurisdiction. Under no
circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy,
nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would
be unlawful.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any retail investor
in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”).
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the debt securities described in the attached Offering
Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering, selling or distributing such debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in
the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member
state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes
of the Prospectus Regulation.

**MiFID II product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparties only target**
**market – Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment**
in respect of the debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for such debt securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities
to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending such debt securities (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor
in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently no key information document required by PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the debt securities
described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United
Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the debt securities described in the
Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may
be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the United
Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of such debt securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation. The expression “UK Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom
and is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments
falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005,
as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high
net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the
United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity

with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated
(all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Offering Memorandum is directed only
at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which the Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant
persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparties only target**
**market – Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment**
in respect of the debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for such debt securities is eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of
Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such
debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product
**Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt**
securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

offered the securities. The information in this Offering Memorandum is current only as of the date on the cover
page, and may change after that date. For any time after the cover date of this Offering Memorandum, the
Issuers do not represent that their affairs or the affairs of the Group (as defined herein) are the same as described

The Issuers are offering the Notes in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the

or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering

related aspects of a purchase of the Notes. You are responsible for making your own examination of the Issuers
and the Group and your own assessment of the merits and risks of investing in the Notes. The Issuers are not,

**PROHIBITION OF OFFERS TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom. For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii)
not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”).
Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering, selling or
distributing the Notes the debt securities described in this Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing such
debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member
state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement

of the Prospectus Regulation.

sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and
therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in

prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This
Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (for the purposes
of this paragraph, a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook
(the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment
in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

This Offering Memorandum contains statistics, data and other information relating to markets, market
sizes, market shares, market positions and other industry data pertaining to the Group’s business and markets.
Market data and statistics are inherently subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market
conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective
judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and
transactions should be included in the relevant market.

We have generally obtained the market and competitive position data in this Offering Memorandum
from governmental databases, industry publications and from surveys, studies or reports conducted by thirdparty sources and data providers that we believe to be reliable. However, the accuracy and completeness of such
information is not guaranteed and has not been independently verified. Additionally, such studies generally
state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the
accuracy or completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances the sources do not assume
liability for such information. We have obtained certain of the market and industry data presented in this
Offering Memorandum from reports produced by third-party governmental institutions or industry specialists
such as Eurostat, De Nederlandsche Bank, the World Bank, OECD, the European Commission, Statistics
Netherlands (“CBS”) (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek), umlaut consulting GmbH (“Umlaut”),
MarketResponse, Institute of Labor Economics, Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (“CPB”) (Centraal
Planbureau), Agentschap Telecom (“AT”), and The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets
(“ACM”) (Autoriteit Consument & Markt) and from information made publicly available by our competitors
and other market participants. The estimated market share data included in this Offering Memorandum are
provided by third party advisors, may selectively include management estimates and expert assumptions, are
not part of our financial statements or financial accounting records and have not be audited or otherwise
reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or experts. The market position data included in this Offering
Memorandum is based on mobile service revenue and number of SIMs based on our mobile service revenue
and number of SIMs compared to our competitors based on their publicly disclosed information. The use or
computation of market share may not be comparable to the use or computation of market share measures
reported or used by other companies, including in our industry.

Some of the information herein has been extrapolated from such market data or reports using our
experience and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, statements regarding the industry
in which we operate and our position in this industry are based solely on our experience, internal studies and
estimates, and our own investigation of market conditions. We believe that such information and statements are
true and accurate, but there can be no assurance that is the case. Such information and statements have not been
verified by any independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding such information,
statements and any similar data presented herein, such information, statements or similar data are subject to
change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or
completeness of any such information or statements in this Offering Memorandum. We do, however, accept
responsibility for the correct reproduction of this information.

We cannot guarantee that the comparative peer data that we present in this Offering Memorandum has
been prepared or presented on a comparable basis to our own revenue and other financial information and we
understand that some of such data may be based on estimates only. We also cannot guarantee the accuracy and
completeness of such comparative peer data, and we have not independently verified or reviewed such peer
data and such data should not be relied upon in making, or refraining from making, any investment decision.
Accordingly, the comparative peer data presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution,
as such information may not be directly comparable to our own key operating information.

**TRADE MARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

We have proprietary and/or licence rights to certain trademarks or trade names that we use in
conjunction with the operation of our businesses. We do not intend our use or display of other companies’
trademarks or trade names to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, any other

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains “forward-looking statements,” as that term is defined by the U.S.
federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements other than
statements of historical facts contained in this Offering Memorandum, including, but without limitation, those

“could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,”
“project,” “should,” and “will” and similar words used in this Offering Memorandum.

By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and
uncertainties. Many of these assumptions, risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Accordingly, actual
results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such forwardlooking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding our present and future business strategies and
the environment in which we operate. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on the statements, which
speak only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or
undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to
reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or
circumstances on which any such statement is based.

Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or
events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there
can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. Risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking
statements included in this Offering Memorandum include those described under “Risk Factors.”

The following are some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ
materially from anticipated results or events:

    - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and its effect on our customers’ behavior;

    - the severe disruptions in the Dutch and the global economy caused by the spread of the COVID19 pandemic and the impact on our liquidity and access to capital;

    - the high level of competition in the markets in which we operate;

    - changes in the economic or political environment in The Netherlands;

    - our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and the risks associated with those acquisitions;

-----

    - other factors related to our indebtedness and financial information, the Notes, our structure, the
Notes Guarantees, the Collateral and the Shared Collateral described in more detail under “Risk
_Factors.”_

The telecommunications industry is changing rapidly and, therefore, the forward-looking statements
of expectations, plans and intent in this Offering Memorandum are subject to a significant degree of risk.

We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts’ expectations or estimates or to
release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the
date of this Offering Memorandum.

We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our
expectations in this Offering Memorandum. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements
attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. When we indicate that an event, condition or circumstance
could or would have an adverse effect on us, we mean to include effects upon our business, financial and other
conditions, results of operations and the Issuers’ ability to make payments under the Notes.

This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements
is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with other factors that are included
in this Offering Memorandum. See “Risk Factors” along with sections of this Offering Memorandum titled
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry,
_Competition and Market Overview” and “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could_
affect our future performance and the markets in which we operate. All forward-looking statements should be
evaluated in light of their inherent uncertainty.

We operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks, uncertainties and other
factors may emerge that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements as a prediction of actual results. Except as required by law or the rules and regulations of any
exchange on which our securities are listed, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertakings to release
publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum
to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any
forward-looking statement contained in this Offering Memorandum is based.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “IFRS” herein are to
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**Financial Statements Presented**

**_Financial Information of the Issuers_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer are newly formed entities incorporated
on July 20, 2021, in each case for purposes of facilitating the Transactions and performing certain activities
related thereto. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer
and, following the completion of the Acquisition, the Target will be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuers have no revenuegenerating activities of their own, and no business operations, material assets or liabilities other than those
acquired or incurred in connection with their incorporation and the Transactions. As a result, no historical
financial information of the Issuers is included in this Offering Memorandum, except for certain limited
“adjusted” financial data presented on a consolidated basis, adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions
and the use of proceeds therefrom, including the impact on the cash position, the amount of debt and the interest
expense of the Group. The effects of purchase price accounting from the Acquisition have not yet been reflected
in the information presented in this Offering Memorandum. The Acquisition may have certain effects on our
financial statements and may impact our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows, which
we are unable to determine with certainty until after the Completion Date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The preparation of our financial statements involves_
_judgments, estimates and assumptions, and changes in financial accounting standards may cause unexpected_
_revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Acquisition—We have made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition in forecasts that may prove to be_
_materially inaccurate.”_

**_Historical Financial Information of the Target Group_**

The consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position and
consolidated statement of cash flows of the Target Group presented herein are derived from (i) the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2020, including the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the European Union and which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.
(the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, including
the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting (the “Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Historical Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering
Memorandum is derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Financial Statements”). The audited consolidated financial statements of the
Target Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were originally approved by us on December 31,
2019. Thereafter, we have restated certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31,
2018, included in the 2019 Financial Statements, by restating the classification of “other receivables” to “trade
receivables” for an amount of €619 thousand, “other payables” to “current other liabilities” for an amount of
€68,947 thousand, “non-current other liabilities” to “other liabilities” for an amount of €2,004 thousand, “other
receivables” to “other assets” for an amount of €32,629 thousand and “tax liabilities” to “liabilities held for
sale” for an amount of €1,792 thousand. These restatements do not have any impact on the reported profit for
the year 2018 or reported equity and an immaterial impact on the cash flow statement for 2018. As a result, we
have not separately restated the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. See note
2.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements.


-----

In addition, we also present certain financial information of the Target Group for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021 (the “LTM Financial Information”). Except as otherwise stated, the LTM
Financial Information is derived by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of profit
or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the
audited consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income of the Target Group for the
year ended December 31, 2020 and deducting the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of
profit or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
The LTM Financial Information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily
representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.
Except as stated otherwise, the LTM Financial Information is not prepared in the ordinary course of our
financial reporting or in accordance with IFRS.

We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) effective from January 1, 2019. As a result, leases (as lessee) that would
have been classified in previous periods as operating leases are recognized in our consolidated statement of
financial position as of December 31, 2019. Under the new standard, except for short-term or low-value leases,
the right to use a leased asset is recognized as an asset with a corresponding financial liability for the present
value of outstanding lease payments. Assets with a finite useful life are subject to impairment testing. We have
adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective method. On the transition to IFRS 16, remaining payment
obligations from existing operating leases were discounted using the relevant incremental borrowing rate and
recognized as a lease liability and the right-to-use assets were carried as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of
the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments.

As a result of the application of new accounting standards and the associated impact on our Historical
Consolidated Financial Statements, prospective investors should exercise particular caution when comparing
our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 to our financial
condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The preparation of our financial_
_statements involves judgments, estimates and assumptions, and changes in financial accounting standards may_
_cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.” For a discussion of the_
effects of the adoption of IFRS 16 on our financial condition and results of operations, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability_
_of Our Results of Operations—Adoption of IFRS 16” and note 2.4 to the 2019 Financial Statements._

We have included in this Offering Memorandum for the convenience of the reader, certain metrics
excluding the impact of cash leases that have been impacted by IFRS 16 as the adoption of IFRS 16 has had a
significant impact on our historical financials which has impacted the comparability of some of our Historical
Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum and we believe it is
of interest to investors to present certain measures excluding such impact to facilitate like-for-like comparability
between our historical financial information during the periods under review.

After the completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group will not prepare separate consolidated
financial statements and we instead intend to report our consolidated financial results at the level of the Parent.
Due to this, our future financial statements may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial
statements included in this Offering Memorandum. Our future financial statements could be materially different
once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial
statements included in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Impacting Comparability—Reporting.”_

**Pro Forma Adjustments Related to the Tele2 and Simpel Acquisitions and T-Infra Demerger**

We completed the acquisition of Tele2 on January 2, 2019 and the acquisition of Simpel on December
1, 2020. On September 1, 2018, we completed the demerger of part of our passive equipment and part of our
rented sites to a separate legal entity, T-Infra. T-Infra was transferred to Deutsche Telekom on January 1, 2019,
and ceased to form part of our consolidated financial results from that date. In this Offering Memorandum, we
present Pro Forma Net Revenue which is based on Tele2 and Simpel’s revenues for their respective preacquisition periods (adjusted for the estimated impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16) which are added to our revenue
and adjusted for certain management reclassifications. We also present in this Offering Memorandum, Pro


-----

Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying RunRate EBITDA AcL which make certain adjustments to our EBITDA for the periods presented to take into
account the reported EBITDA contributions of Tele2 and Simpel for their respective pre-acquisition periods,
and eliminating the reported (negative) EBITDA of T-Infra (demerged business) for the relevant periods after
making certain intercompany adjustments based on management reclassifications and to exclude special factors
such as pre- and post-acquisition integration and restructuring costs related to the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions,
as detailed in this Offering Memorandum.

Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL,
Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL as presented herein are not intended to
represent pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X
promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC requirements or IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles. Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL are based upon available information
and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The assumptions underlying
Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Underlying
EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL have not been audited or reviewed in accordance with
any generally accepted auditing standards. Any reliance you place on this information should fully take this
into consideration. Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL,
Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL are not prepared in the ordinary course of
our financial reporting. Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL are presented for informational
purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have
been had the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel and the de-merger of T-infra actually occurred on the dates
indicated, and they do not purport to project the results of operations or financial condition for any future period
or as of any future date.

**Non-IFRS Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain financial measures and ratios (the “Non-IFRS
**Measures”), including Pro Forma Net Revenue, EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted**
EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin, Underlying
EBITDA AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL Margin, Pro Forma Operating Free Cash Flow, Underlying Operating
Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, Capital Expenditure, Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL and Underlying
Run-Rate EBITDA AcL Margin that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting standards.

Non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum (and which are subject to the
qualifications described below) include the following. For further information, see “Summary—Summary
_Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial Information” and “Summary—Summary Financial_
_Information and Other Data—Capital Expenditure Data.”_

    - “Pro Forma Net Revenue” which represents our net revenue for the year/period, to include the
pro forma effect of the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel, in each case from January 1, 2018 and
certain TMNL management reclassifications.

    - We present Pro Forma Net Revenue because we believe that it facilitates like-for-like
comparability between our historical financial information during the periods under review.

    - “EBITDA” which we define as net profit/(loss) for the relevant period, before income taxes, gain
from other financial activities, net finance costs and depreciation, amortization and impairment
losses.

    - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” which we define as our EBITDA adjusted for the Tele2 and
Simpel acquisitions, the demerger of T-Infra and certain TMNL management reclassifications, as
well as to exclude special factors such as pre- and post-acquisition integration and restructuring


-----

costs related to the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, consisting primarily of advisory costs/support,
network integration costs and severance costs.

- “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL” which we define as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA further
adjusted to exclude the estimated impact of IFRS 16, thereby including operating lease expenses
in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in order to arrive at a closer alignment with cash EBITDA.

- “Underlying EBITDA AcL” which we define as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, adjusted to
exclude (i) certain items, which management believes are one-off and/or non-recurring items and
(ii) removal costs related to the stock appreciation right (“SAR”) scheme introduced by TMNL in
2017.

We present EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL and
Underlying EBITDA AcL because we believe that these measures provide useful information to
our management and investors with respect to our overall operating performance by facilitating
comparisons of operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of items not
directly resulting from core operations. We present these Non-IFRS Measures because we believe
that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other
interested parties as supplemental measures of performance.

- “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin” which we define as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
divided by Pro Forma Net Revenue, expressed as a percentage.

- “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin” which we define as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
AcL divided by Pro Forma Net Revenue, expressed as a percentage.

- “Underlying EBITDA AcL Margin” which we define as Underlying EBITDA AcL divided by
Pro Forma Net Revenue, expressed as a percentage.

- “Pro Forma Operating Free Cash Flow” which we define as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL
less Capital Expenditure.

- “Underlying Operating Free Cash Flow” which we define as Underlying EBITDA AcL less
Capital Expenditure.

We present Pro Forma Operating Free Cash Flow and Underlying Operating Free Cash Flow
because we believe that similar free cash flow measures are frequently used by securities analysts,
investors and other interested parties in evaluating similar issuers. Pro Forma Operating Free Cash
Flow and Underlying Operating Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of cash
flow from operations under IFRS or as an indicator of liquidity.

- “Cash Conversion” which we define as Underlying Operating Free Cash Flow divided by
Underlying EBITDA AcL.

- “Capital Expenditure” which we calculate as the sum of mobile capital expenditure, fixed capital
expenditure, IT capital expenditure and other capital expenditure.

- “Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL” which we define as Underlying EBITDA AcL adjusted
for (i) the full year effect of achieved synergies and (ii) the full year impact of planned unrealized
synergies.

We believe Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL provides useful information to our management
and investors with respect to our overall operating performance. We present Underlying Run-Rate
EBITDA AcL because we believe that it and similar measures are widely used by certain
investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of
performance.


-----

    - “Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL Margin” which we define as Underlying Run-Rate
EBITDA AcL divided by Pro Forma Net Revenue, expressed as a percentage.

The Non-IFRS measures and other information presented in this Offering Memorandum have been
prepared for information purposes only and have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or
any other internationally accepted accounting principles or audited or reviewed in accordance with any
applicable auditing standards. These non-IFRS measures and other information are not identified as accounting
measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative or substitute measures to evaluate
our performance.

You should not consider the foregoing items as alternatives or substitutes to comparable IFRS
measures. Moreover, these measures and related ratios:

    - have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation;

    - are not measures of our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS;

    - should not be considered as alternatives to net cash flow from operating activities or any other
measure of our liquidity derived in accordance with IFRS;

    - should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to profit/(loss) after tax or any other
performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS;

    - may not be indicative of our results of operations; and

    - do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash requirements.

You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Historical Consolidated
Financial Statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement the evaluation of our
performance. We present the Non-IFRS measures and other information (i) as they are used by our management
to monitor and report to the board on financial position and (ii) to present similar measures that are widely used
by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of financial
position, financial performance and liquidity. We present the Non-IFRS Measures because we believe that they

**Overview**

Operating under the T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel brands, we are one of the three mobile network
operators (“MNOs”) in the Dutch telecommunications market. We offer mobile (both postpaid and prepaid)
and fixed telecommunications services to both B2C and B2B customers, and we also sell handsets to our
customers. We are the largest mobile telecommunications provider in the Dutch consumer market by mobile
service revenue and number of SIMs, we have been ranked as the best mobile network in The Netherlands for
the fifth year in a row, and we have also been ranked as the top network in the world (Source: Umlaut, The
_2021 Mobile Network Test in The Netherlands; PresseBox, T-Mobile Awarded “Best in Test” Worldwide by_
_Umlaut)._

As of September 30, 2021, we had 6.9 million mobile subscribers and 0.7 million fixed subscribers, representing
an increase of approximately 29% and 24%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2018. For the twelve
months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions and other adjustments, our combined mobile
service revenues totaled €1,215.1 million, our combined fixed line services revenue totaled €391 million, and
our revenue from the sale of goods and services, and other revenues totaled €443 million. Mobile service
revenue combines mobile revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as visitor roaming, and our fixed
line services revenue combines fixed line revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as fixed line
wholesale revenue. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions and other
adjustments, our revenue for the B2C segment totaled €1,239 million and for the B2B segment was €292
million. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was €637.4
million.

TMNL traces its origins back to 2002, when Deutsche Telekom entered the Dutch market through the
acquisition of Ben, which it subsequently rebranded as T-Mobile in 2003. In 2007, we acquired Orange
Netherlands, making us the third largest mobile operator in The Netherlands after Koninklijke KPN N.V.
(“KPN”) and VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V. (“VFZ”). In 2016, we acquired Vodafone’s fixed business,
Vodafone Thuis, which was subsequently renamed to TMNL Thuis. This transaction marked our entry into the
fixed market, adding approximately 150,000 fixed line customers. Through the TMNL Thuis acquisition, we
also gained access to a dark fiber footprint on KPN’s fiber network (KPN ODF). In January 2019, we completed
the acquisition of Tele2, strengthening our position in the Dutch market, across all segments. In December
2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, an online-only SIM-only MVNO on our network, focusing in
particular on the low budget segment of the market. The Simpel acquisition further strengthened our position,
making us the leader both in terms of B2C mobile postpaid SIM cards and service revenues. We continue to
operate the Simpel brand after its acquisition in 2020. In April 2021, we announced a strategic partnership with
Open Dutch Fiber, a company owned by KKR and DTCP that plans to roll-out fiber services to over one million
homes passed. We are the anchor tenant on this network which focuses on dense, urban areas in which we
currently have a large mobile market share. The Open Dutch Fiber partnership is an example of our asset-light
model and lean operational setup, which we believe enables us to streamline our business and optimize our
indirect cost base ratio.

We provide our B2C customers with a multi-brand portfolio of mobile services, including voice,
messaging and broadband aiming to cover all segments of the market from premium to low-budget and
operating on our own networks of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G spectra. Through T-Mobile Thuis, we offer nationwide
fixed broadband, TV and fixed voice services with FTTH and xDSL (copper) technologies. In addition, and in
line with market trends, we offer B2C customers packages that bundle mobile and fixed telecommunications
services at attractive prices, known as FMC packages. Our B2B business segment is dedicated to meeting the


-----

connectivity needs of companies of all types and sizes as we offer a broad range of telecommunications
solutions, cloud-based and unified communications solutions. The chart below sets forth key events in our
growth and transformation to the largest mobile telecommunications provider in The Netherlands’ B2C market
and an established mobile-led FMC challenger.

We have invested heavily in our offerings and we believe we have successfully repositioned our
business through innovation and change, as evidenced by our new offerings and services and by our being the
first provider to offer nationwide 5G coverage on the 700 MHz band. Going forward, we believe we are uniquely
positioned to capitalize on further growth opportunities, enabling us to continue on our historical trajectory and
set new industry standards. The chart below highlights some of our key successes between 2015 and 2020.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Attractive telecommunications market structure in The Netherlands_**

We operate in The Netherlands, which has a sizeable and attractive telecommunications market which
consists of three main telecommunications providers. The Netherlands is the 6[th ]largest economy in Europe and
has a robust macroeconomic environment, with 2% real GDP growth expected for 2021, moderate population
and household growth, and a large demand for high-quality communication services (Source: Telecompaper).
We compete in both the mobile and the fixed markets with KPN and VFZ. We are the premier company in the
B2C mobile market with a 42% market share as calculated by our number of postpaid SIM subscribers, as


-----

compared to a 30% market share for KPN and 25% for VFZ in the same market. The MVNO market is small
accounting for approximately 4% market share of postpaid SIMs, with the largest MVNO, Youfone, having an
approximately 3% market share based on number of SIM subscribers. In this context, we believe the risk of
irrational behaviors by existing competitors is low and that existing MNOs are likely to compete primarily on
the quality of their services. Following our acquisition of Tele2, the market players were further consolidated
from four to three and a process of revenue and ARPU stabilization started, similar to what has been seen in
other markets such as Austria, Germany or Ireland. The Netherlands has one of the lowest ARPU levels in
Europe.

We also believe that the risk of a new MNO entering the market is low. We believe that this is due to
the following factors: (i) the highly converged nature of the market, making it less attractive for new entrants,
as they must be able to offer both mobile and fixed offers to be competitive therein and (ii) the lack of any
viable spectrum auction that could allow the entrance of a new player, since the upcoming 5G spectrum auction
in The Netherlands is planned to offer only a specific band of spectrum and we do not need to renew our existing
spectrum licenses until 2030, making the auction more suitable for existing MNOs and unsuitable for new
entrants. The most recent possibility for a new entrant to obtain a marketable spectrum allocation would have
been the 2020 multi-band spectrum auction. However, only the three main players in the telecommunications
market, namely KPN, VFZ and us, participated in the auction. Additionally, we believe that the competitive
risk posed by MVNOs is low because MVNOs have limited ability to compete on unlimited subscriptions in
light of each MVNO’s lack of owned network and their limited ability to cover FMC packages, as well as such
unlimited plans’ impact on costs. Indeed, the number of MVNOs has decreased by half from approximately 60
to approximately 30 in The Netherlands over the last six years.

Furthermore, we anticipate that the B2C mobile market will continue to grow as data traffic continues
to increase. Indeed, our B2C mobile pro forma service revenues grew by 3.1% in 2020 (after a 4.1% decrease
in 2019) despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Key trends include:

(i) Growth in postpaid SIMs subscriptions, which is driven both by prepaid to postpaid subscription

migration and by population growth, as well as trends of increasing proportions of multi-SIM
subscriptions; and

(ii) Growth in mobile ARPU as driven by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services, value-added

services as well as overall inflation and the telecommunications market’s shift towards larger data
bundles. We believe that B2C ARPU will grow in the future due to these factors, even though
mobile ARPUs had decreased in The Netherlands in past years because of intense price
competition and mobile discounting as part of FMC offers, mainly triggered by KPN and VFZ.

The following table sets out historical trends in B2C mobile services ARPU across our brands and our
two major competitors, KPN and VFZ, and demonstrates that while ARPU among our competitors has generally
decreased in recent years, ARPU among our brands has generally increased or stabilized.


-----

_Source: Company information and publicly available information adjusted based on management estimates._

The B2B market has seen similar developments. In particular, ARPU in the SOHO/VSE segment
follows consumer market trends, driven as in the B2C market by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services
and value-added services, and we believe those drivers will continue to push ARPU growth. In the B2B market
generally, we believe that growth in subscribers will be driven by growth in SOHO/VSE businesses, an
increased adoption of mobile services in the B2B market and an increasing adoption of converged
telecommunications solutions.

Additionally, the Dutch fixed telecommunications market has benefitted from infrastructure upgrades
in recent years that have contributed to a growing market, in spite of declining telephony and peaking TV,
primarily due to a higher demand for broadband services at higher speeds, which is our core product offering
within the fixed segment. Historically, the fixed internet market in The Netherlands was dominated by KPN
and VFZ, which have a combined market share of approximately 80%. We have positioned ourselves as a
challenger in this market, focusing on providing fast broadband services and offering competitive and
sustainable pricing. In the future, we believe that growth in the fixed market will be driven by (i) an increase in
subscribers associated with household growth and (ii) premium customers’ willingness to pay for ultrafast fiber
and better quality, which allows for more-for-more strategies and results in increasing demand for higher fiberbased data bundles.

FTTH coverage is expanding in The Netherlands and the B2C and B2B markets are expected to benefit
from such expansion. We expect to benefit from this trend through what we call our ‘Magenta’ footprint, which
includes several Optical Distribution Framework-type of agreements and partnerships with, among others, Open
Dutch Fiber, KPN’s affiliate Reggefiber Operator B.V. and Primevest Capital Partners, where we expect to


-----

eventually have access to over three million households at sustainable commercial terms. The remaining
households can be reached by Wholesale Broadband Access (“WBA”)-type of access on KPN copper (until its
planned phase-out over the next three years) and/or fiber network. Additional infrastructure players of
significant size include Delta Fiber, Glaspoort (a joint venture between KPN and APG Groep N.V.) and
Eurofiber.

**_World-class network and strong commercial execution_**

We lead our competitors across a number of key attributes, including our world-class mobile network
with the largest spectrum portfolio in The Netherlands, our leading brand portfolio and our strong commercial
execution.

In December 2020, Umlaut ranked us the best mobile network in The Netherlands for the fifth year in
a row, and in February 2021, they recognized us as the top network in the world (Sources: PresseBox, Five in
_a Row—T-Mobile Wins the Umlaut Connect Mobile Benchmark in The Netherlands Again; PresseBox, T-_
_Mobile Awarded “Best in Test” Worldwide by Umlaut). According to the ACM, our mobile network carries_
approximately 50% of mobile data traffic in The Netherlands. We believe that our leading network position
results from our efficiently leveraging three key pillars: (i) technology, such as single radio access network
(“RAN”) with future-proof site configurations that are regularly upgraded in anticipation of customer demand;
(ii) sites, as we operate an optimal site grid with the highest site density in urban areas and 4,982 base stations
in total, providing coverage to more than 99% of the population of The Netherlands; (iii) the largest mobile
spectrum portfolio in The Netherlands with interference-free low bands, resulting in high cost efficiency and
an indoor capacity advantage. As of December 31, 2020, we held an aggregate of 250 MHz of spectrum, in
comparison with 215 MHz for VFZ and 195 MHz for KPN. None of the licenses in our portfolio need to be
renewed before 2030.

We have distinguished ourselves by our distinctive brand portfolio. In line with other MNOs in The
Netherlands, we have been following value-based and more-for-more strategies that target different market
segments with separate brands. Each of our four brands has a distinctive positioning with differentiated profiles,
as summarized in the following chart.

Our strong commercial execution is supported by our multiple sales channels and highly optimized
distribution network. We complement our in-store retail sales channel with an indirect sales channel that
deploys more than 500 extra partner stores that we regard as vital to boost physical sales. On top of our brickand-mortar network, webshops for T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel serve as efficient and growing online


-----

channels that are instrumental for the sales of the whole brand portfolio. Our direct and indirect online channels
accounted for more than 60% of our B2C sales in 2020, which we regard as proof of our established and
effective digital presence. Furthermore, customer service for Ben and T-Mobile has been voted the best in the
Dutch telecommunications industry in 2021 as determined by a customer survey (Source: MarketResponse
_customer survey). The quality of our customer service both in our physical locations and through our online_
presence has resulted both in continuous improvement of customer satisfaction and generation of FMC leads.

**_Well-positioned to benefit from market tailwinds for growth in market share, B2C revenue, customer_**
**_satisfaction and ARPU_**

Our status as a leading B2C mobile operator is confirmed by our market share as measured by our
volume of subscribers and by our revenue. As of December 31, 2020, we have 42% of the B2C mobile postpaid
market share by volume, which corresponds to 5.1 million SIMs. We have managed to reach our leading volume
market share of 42% over the past three years, supported in part by the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, while
the absolute number of subscribers grew at a CAGR of 4.5% between 2018 and 2020. At the same time, our
market share by revenue increased from 33% to 40% over the same period.

Our B2C mobile revenue growth in the past three years was mainly driven by stable ARPUs at brand
levels and a growing subscriber base, driven by marketing strategies for our brands, our strong positioning in
unlimited bundles on T-Mobile and Tele2, and an increase in demand for cheaper bundles with Ben and Simpel.

We have also maintained growth in customer satisfaction, which has helped us retain customers. In
the B2C mobile market, TMNL outpaced its competitors in The Netherlands by delivering the fastest-increasing
customer satisfaction TRI*M score over the last decade. TRI*M is a customer satisfaction metric widely
adopted within the Deutsche Telekom Group which combines customer recommendation, customer likelihood
to continue services, competitive advantage and performance. Our TRI*M score increased by over 50% over
12 years. We believe that an increase in customer satisfaction was one of the key factors driving the reduction
in our B2C mobile churn to approximately 11% in 2020.

We believe that our position as a leading B2C mobile operator with growing customer satisfaction
metrics situates us well to take advantage of trends towards converged fixed and mobile offerings and more

-----

for-more strategies, as it allows us a larger base of customers to cross-sell into FMC packages and to upsell into
more premium offers. See “—World-class network and strong commercial execution” and “Industry—Dutch
_Broadband and Fixed Telephony Market—Focus on fixed broadband market.” Already in the first three quarters_
of 2021, our ARPU has grown across all four of our brands, corresponding to increases of between €0.8 and
€1.1 in the third quarter of 2021 in comparison with the first quarter of 2021. We expect to experience moderate
growth in the future by building on our success in growing subscriber base and potential further ARPU growth.

**_High operational efficiency and an asset-light fixed model_**

We have a successful track record of M&A, synergy realization and cost optimization. This track
record, combined with a lean, asset-light fixed business model has given us operating leverage and operational
efficiency.

In 2016, we acquired Vodafone’s B2C fixed business, Vodafone Thuis, which we shortly thereafter
rebranded T-Mobile Thuis. Vodafone’s divestiture of Vodafone Thuis was ordered by the European
Commission as a remedy to provide competition clearance for VFZ, the joint venture between Vodafone and
Ziggo. This acquisition marked the beginning of our present fixed internet business and added about 150,000
fixed-line customers. In January 2019, we completed our acquisition of Tele2. This acquisition has strengthened
our position in the Dutch telecommunications market and allowed us to compete more effectively with KPN
and VFZ by giving us enhanced scale, combined spectrum resources and significant synergy potential. We are
executing a three-year plan to realize synergies from our acquisition of Tele2 in 2019. We have closed Tele2’s
standalone stores and we are in the process of implementing significant operations costs savings. Based on our
estimates, we anticipate realizing Tele2 cost-saving synergies with a total run-rate synergy potential of €130
million by 2024, of which we have already realized €115 million of synergies run-rate as of September 30,
2021. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, by then the largest MVNO in The
Netherlands. By means of this transaction, we acquired one million additional B2C mobile postpaid customers
who were already using our network under Simpel’s prior wholesale agreement with us. The acquisition of
Simpel provide further synergy and cost savings potential to be realized in the total amount of approximately
€9 million by 2024. Synergies related to Tele2 and Simpel entail for example related to reduced interconnect
costs, migration of Tele2’s business support system (“BSS”) to our Magenta stack, synergies in respect of bad
debt collections (representing improved client acceptance and collection practices implemented upon
integration with TMNL), direct and indirect cost savings related to the discontinuance of the Tele2 network and
the cancellation of leased telecommunications towers, reduction in marketing expenses as a result of mobile
cross-selling, optimization of campaigning periods, reduction in other indirect costs such as personnel related
costs as well as legal audit and tax fees. For risks related to our growth through acquisitions, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks,_
_including the risk that we may not be able to integrate newly acquired operations into our business, which may_
_prevent us from realizing the strategic and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and_
_thus adversely affect our business.”_

We believe that these strategic acquisitions, coupled with our rapid and successful organic growth
initiatives, position us well to capture further market share and grow margins across the business segments in
which we operate.

Further, our lean and digital business model also allows us to benefit from strong operating leverage.
Aside from the lean operating cost base described above, we have also repositioned ourselves to become a
digital telecommunications company with an asset-light fixed model. On September 1, 2018, we demerged our
tower business into Cignal Infrastructure (at demerger and until June 2021, T-Infra). Subsequently, on January
1, 2019, one day prior to the closing of the Tele2 acquisition, we distributed Cignal Infrastructure as a dividend
in kind to Deutsche Telekom, with TMNL continuing to have full access to the contributed infrastructure
through a long-term, arms-length service agreement. In June 2021, Deutsche Telekom sold Cignal Infrastructure
to Digital Infrastructure Vehicle 1 SCSP, which is a joint venture of Cellnex and DTCP. Currently, we benefit
from access to 3,150 towers owned by Cignal Infrastructure with nationwide coverage under a long term
contract for an initial term of 15 years, with the option for T-Mobile Netherlands to renew for two additional
periods of 10 years each, and at favorable terms consisting of a capped yearly cost increase in line with the
Consumer Price Index. Additionally, we continue to hold our own market-leading mobile spectrum portfolio.


-----

In our fixed segment we also have an asset-light model. Our partners, Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest,
are conducting the roll-out of our FTTH network, and we do not have any direct fixed access network
ownership. We expect to have access to the over one million FTTH homes that Open Dutch Fiber is scheduled
to roll out to by 2025 in densely-populated areas with strong TMNL mobile customer presence. Under the
Primvest partnership, we expect that we will have FTTH access to approximately 130,000 homes passed. By
the terms of this partnership, we benefit from an initial period of exclusivity and line prices with base rates of
not more than €15 per month, indexed to inflation and subject to certain adjustments. In both of these
partnerships, we have agreed to certain utilization commitments. In addition, we have access to approximately
two million homes passed on KPN’s Open Distribution Framework footprint which is completed by WBA for
a nationwide fixed network footprint.

Such a lean business model has allowed us to achieve total capital expenditure savings of over €700
million, estimated as savings as a result of us not having to allocate and devote capital expenditure on building
a fiber network and mobile towers for five years.

**_Strong cash flow profile with demonstrated resilience and strong cash generation_**

We have historically demonstrated a track record of growth, profitability improvement and strong cash
flow generation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to maintain growth and increase
profitability, as evidenced by a 29.7% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin in 2020 in comparison to
26.7% in 2019. We believe this demonstrates the resilience of our business and of our company overall. In
addition, we generated a 56% Cash Conversion in 2020 in comparison with an average level of 30% for other
international telecommunication companies.

We delivered revenue growth in a challenging market environment between 2018 and 2020 at a 2%
CAGR. Such growth was mainly driven by a growing subscriber base and stabilizing ARPU levels in the mobile
B2C segment, as well as by strong growth in our B2C fixed business. Historically, our B2C mobile segment
has been the major contributor to revenue at a 4% CAGR between 2018 and 2020, having accounted for 47%
of total revenue in 2020. Our B2C mobile business delivered significant SIM net adds, particularly in the Simpel
and Ben brands, and relatively stable ARPUs among those of our brands that offered the increasingly-popular
unlimited data bundles. Positive developments offset a decrease in roaming revenue as a result of COVID-19–
induced travelling restrictions. Our B2C fixed segment was our fastest-growing segment, growing at a CAGR
of 11% over the past three years. We believe that this strong growth was driven by a successful FMC challenger
strategy which resulted in strong growth in subscriber base that amounted to an additional 133,000 customers
in the past three years.

We also delivered strong performance in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, both in terms of margin
expansion and growth. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin increased from 22.8% in 2018 to 29.7%
in 2020 and to 31.1% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL
exhibited a strong CAGR of 16.1% between 2018 and 2020 due to an improved gross margin, declining indirect
costs in absolute terms from cost saving programs and headcount reduction, and realization of Tele2 synergies.

Because we delivered strong revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL expansion through
challenging market conditions, we believe that we are in a position of strength and greater scale to deliver
incremental top line and profitability expansion as market conditions improve.

We also benefit from a strong cash generation profile driven by a solid top-line performance that is
combined with prudent cost management and moderate capital expenditure needs. Our Underlying Operating
Free Cash Flow increased by 53% in 2020 compared to 2019, and is expected to continue on a growth trajectory
going forward as we maintain our capital expenditure-light strategy. Our Cash Conversion was 56% in 2020
and it further increased to 58.9% during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, which is above the
average level of 30% for other international telecommunication companies.

The below chart shows our resilience and strong cash flow profile by presenting certain business
metrics for the periods under review, on a pro forma basis for the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, the demerger
of T-Infra and the application of IFRS 16, as applicable, in each case from January 1, 2018. For further

**_Committed and experienced management team_**

Our experienced management team is led by our CEO, Søren Abildgaard, and our CFO, Gero
Niemeyer, each of whom has over 22 years of industry experience. Our management team is seasoned in
running, acquiring and staffing telecommunications businesses and in navigating consumer markets both in The
Netherlands and abroad, and they leverage the expertise they acquired over decades of combined experience at
top-tier telecommunications and consultancy companies such as Telia, Orange, Magenta Telekom, KPN,
Deloitte and Booz Allen Hamilton. More importantly, the management team has a strong track record of
delivering growth from both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, and has won and maintained strong
stakeholder support while maintaining a strong debt capital structure. This industry-leading management team
is supported by a deep bench of divisional managers, who in turn are supported by a substantial workforce of
1,870 full-time equivalents as of September 30, 2021. Our employees, 48% of whom are customer-facing, are
highly diverse, being represented by 45 distinct nationalities.

Our management team has reached multiple milestones. Under our management’s leadership, revenue
between 2018 and 2020 increased by a CAGR of 2% due to increasing B2C revenues, and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA AcL Margin expanded from 22.8% in 2018 to 29.7% in 2020 as driven by an improved cost structure
and synergies from the Tele2 acquisition. Furthermore, the team has successfully repositioned our company as
a full FMC challenger in addition to having executed the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions.

**Our Strategy**

We have detailed commercial plans to support our further growth, both in terms of volume and of
value, for all brands and segments. In particular, we have identified a number of key drivers leading to growth
in our business which we believe will preserve our leadership position in the future, namely (i) leverage our
leading position in the B2C mobile market, (ii) capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus, (iii) exploitation
of untapped B2B value pools and expansion in fixed and (iv) optimization of our indirect cost base ratio, with
(v) a commitment to ESG initiatives.

**_Leverage our leading position in B2C mobile and benefit from market tailwinds on 5G monetization,_**
**_unlimited offerings, portfolio optimization and increased value-added services_**

We are a leading B2C mobile operator with a SIM market share of 42% in the B2C mobile postpaid
market, corresponding to 5.1 million SIMs as of December 31, 2020. B2C revenue growth resulted from
stabilizing ARPUs in 2019 and 2020 as well as a growing subscriber base, further supported by growth in


-----

unlimited bundles on T-Mobile and Tele2 as well as an increasing demand for cheaper bundles with Ben and
Simpel. We have also seen continued growth in our customer satisfaction. For B2C mobile, we have delivered
the fastest increasing customer satisfaction TRI*M score over the last decade, having outpaced our competitors
in The Netherlands.

Our leading market position provides a strong platform for growth both in terms of volume and value
across all brands and segments. In particular, we plan to grow ARPU through (i) 5G monetization, (ii) unlimited
growth, (iii) portfolio optimizations, (iv) value-added services and (v) FMC growth.

_Drive 5G monetization_

We were the first operator to reach nationwide 5G coverage on the 700 MHz band in 2020, and we
believe that we are well positioned to monetize our 5G investments. We offer 5G connectivity per default to
our premium offerings, such as T-Mobile’s ‘Unlimited plan,’ or as an add-on to our value offerings, such as a
€2 p.c.m. add-on for our Tele2 customers. In the future, we plan to extend our 5G offering and continue our
more-for-more portfolio approach on the back of 5G.

_Grow unlimited offerings_

We believe that we hold a leading position in unlimited offerings based on our number of subscribers
and on our having been the first to have introduced an unlimited plan for mobile in The Netherlands. Our
premium offers in the mobile segment are unlimited plans, which we sell for €35 p.c.m. and €25 p.c.m.,
including value added tax (“VAT”), through the T-Mobile and Tele2 brands respectively. T-Mobile’s
‘Unlimited plan’ also includes 5G connectivity by default. Having introduced these offerings in 2017, our
unlimited subscriber base grew from 578,000 subscribers in December 2018 to more than a million subscribers
in June 2021. In May 2021, we also introduced an ‘Unlimited & Entertainment’ plan including access to Netflix
and Videoland, a Dutch streaming service. We intend to continue to grow our unlimited offerings in the future
as we believe that unlimited plans are a key value driver in our premium portfolio by increasing customer
loyalty and customer satisfaction, and ultimately result in above-average monthly recurring charges (“MRC”).

_Portfolio optimizations_

Our multi-brand portfolio is a key value driver that allows us to effectively compete in all market
segments. All our brands have a distinctive positioning, minimizing the risk of intra-brand competition. With
approximately 100,000 intra-brand migrations in 2020, creating an average incremental MRC of €1, we have
proven the ability to upsell to customers within our portfolio, accruing value.

_Value-added services_

We believe that by offering value-added services (“VAS”), we distinguish ourselves from our
competitors while increasing ARPU, customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. Our new ‘Unlimited &
Entertainment’ package, described above, is one such example. In addition, T-Mobile offers security options
and add-ons from the music streaming service Deezer. On Tele2, we recently introduced ‘Unlimited for a day’
and ‘Unlimited weekend’ plans which add VAS to a Tele2 portfolio that already includes, among other things,
a 5G priced add-on.

_FMC growth_

Compared to KPN and VFZ, who have mobile FMC penetrations of 65% and 71% as of December
31, 2020, we believe that our FMC penetration of 8% as of December 31, 2020 provides us with ample
opportunity for growth. While KPN and VFZ leverage their large fixed bases, we intend to focus on crossselling our fixed offerings into our leading consumer mobile base. Since FMC customers are more loyal, more
satisfied and have higher monthly bill sizes compared to one-product customers, we expect FMC growth to be
attractive, both, in terms of volume and value.


-----

**_Capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus_**

We are a successful challenger in the B2C fixed market with approximately 9% market share by
subscribers in 2020. In the past three years, as our business has grown its subscriber base and revenue at a
CAGR of approximately 11%, marking the fastest growth among our competitors, our market share has grown
from 7% in 2018 to 9% in 2020 and our share of total subscriber gross adds has grown from 17% in 2018 to
20% in 2020. We believe that we have been able to deliver this rapid, market-leading growth by leveraging our
challenger strategy and B2C fixed ARPUs below those of our competition, as our fixed ARPU was
approximately €33 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the market average of
approximately €50. Our price leadership is evidenced by our FMC offer which combines 1 Gbit internet speeds
and a T-Mobile Unlimited subscription for a price of €50 p.m. (€25 p.m. internet + €25 p.m. mobile
subscription), compared to €90 p.m. at KPN (€65 p.m. internet + €25 p.m. mobile) and €93 p.m. at VFZ (€65.5
p.m. internet + €27.5 p.m. mobile). These consumer bundle prices are excluding promotions. We believe this
lower fixed-segment ARPU and challenger strategy represents a strong lever to continue attracting valueseeking customers. As illustrated in the chart below, we are able to offer fixed and mobile services at a
significantly lower price than our competitors.

We have an FTTH footprint that covers approximately 1.6 million homes passed on KPN’s and
Primevest’s networks. FTTH is also achieved through the Magenta footprint. We expect a further increase of
approximately 500,000 homes passed by the end of 2021 and the Magenta footprint is expected to significantly
increase homes passed by 2025. Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest partnerships are also key pillars of this
strategy. We have secured exclusive agreements with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest in addition to benefitting
from non-exclusive ODF wholesale access to the KPN network, complemented by nationwide wholesale access
via KPN bitstream. For more about our partnerships with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest, see “—Our
_Competitive Strengths—High operational efficiency and an asset-light fixed model.” We believe that our_
partnerships with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest in particular will allow us to grow our fixed subscriber base
and drive margin expansion while maintaining healthy cash profile through our capital expenditure-light
strategy.

In the future, we plan to increase our revenue share through share gains at competitive ARPUs. First,
we plan to tap our mobile subscriber base, which is the largest in The Netherlands, to cross-sell our fixed
offerings to our mobile customers. In our T-Mobile brand, FMC penetration rose from 4% in 2018 to 20% in
2020, whereas overall for our company, FMC penetration increased from 2% in 2018 to 8% in 2020. However,
our FMC penetration remains well below the FMC penetration of our competitors. We believe our penetration
will grow in the future both as a result of a focused sales approach and because we expect more SIMs to become
FMC-eligible in 2021-2022. Planned quality improvements will also help grow and maintain our fixed base
through increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Second, we will rely on highly-competitive ARPU levels
to further drive market share gains. Going forward, we are considering shifting towards a value-based
proposition by focusing on high-end fiber speeds and value-added services.


-----

**_Exploit untapped B2B value pools and expand in fixed_**

We have established a presence in the B2B market across all segments, namely SOHO/VSE, SMB and
LE/CE, both with our mobile and our fixed offerings which represent 71% and 29%, respectively, of our B2B
revenue in 2020. Our presence extends across all B2B customer segments with our largest exposure in the
SOHO/VSE and LE/CE segments at 36% of B2B mobile service revenues each, followed by the SMB segment
with a 25% revenue share (Source: Company information).

We have increased our revenue market share in the mobile B2B market from 17% in 2018 to 20% in
2020. For the past three years, we have the fastest-growing B2B mobile operator as measured by SIM net adds,
having earned a 43% SIM net adds share in 2020 in comparison with 31% for the closest competitor. We believe
this strategy highlights our success in attracting B2B mobile customers and managing churn well, and we
believe it will fuel our growth in the coming years. In the fixed B2B market, we had a modest revenue market
share of 4% in 2020, affording us an opportunity to grow our presence in the segment in 2021 and beyond.
Among our key priorities, we aim to transform the former Tele2 large enterprise legacy business and expand
into SOHO/VSE with fixed offerings.

Recognizing the above growth path in B2B mobile and the opportunity in B2B fixed, we have defined
a strategy to develop our potential in each of our SOHO/VSE, SMB and LE/CE B2B segments. Our
entrepreneurial approach is built on four key growth drivers, namely (i) FMC offerings in the SOHO/VSE
segment, (ii) an SMB portfolio that combines FMC offerings (a “converged” portfolio) with cloud-based
service enhancements, (iii) a differentiating partner approach and (iv) fixed transformation in the LE/CE
segment.

_FMC offerings in the attractive SOHO/VSE segment_

The SOHO/VSE segment is a highly attractive market for our services, both because of its higher
margins and because we believe we are well-positioned to succeed in this space as a result of its similarities
with the B2C segment where we are a leader in mobile. This segment has rarely been tapped by either T-Mobile
or Tele2 before and it is growing in line with the B2C market. See “—Our Competitive Strengths—Attractive
_telecommunications market structure in The Netherlands.” Given our strength in mobile offerings in particular,_
we intend to target the SOHO/VSE segment by relying on FMC offerings. For example, in September 2021,
we launched a VSE internet offering and related FMC bundling proposition in order to provide the best value
for money, thus opening an additional market segment for us and a potential source of incremental revenue.

_FMC and cloud-enhanced SMB portfolio along with differentiating partnering approach_

We operate in the SMB segment under the T-Mobile and selectively under the Tele2 brand for larger
SMB customers. Our SMB offering comprises a product portfolio focused on FMC and cloud-enhanced
solutions. In the SOHO/VSE segment, we strive for an increase of our Unlimited attach rate as a key value
driver. In addition, we believe that our SMB FMC seats will increase, driven by, among other things, a Microsoft
Teams integration that forms a unified communications solution which we were the first to launch in the Dutch
market. We have a large mobile customer base and, as in the consumer market, we intend to upsell fixed and
unified communications services to our mobile base. In addition to our core connectivity services, we sell a
broad range of communications and cloud-based solutions tailored to the customers’ needs through our
extensive partner portfolio. See also “—Capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus” above.

_Fixed transformation in LE/CE_

In the LE/CE segment, we are conducting a transformation of our fixed services in order to realize the
full potential of our extended portfolio. We are in the process of a transition from Tele2 legacy fixed
infrastructure to future-proof transactional stacks in order to accommodate changing customer demands that
request faster and more reliable connections and thus are switching to future-proof fiber-based technologies
which includes a shift from copper to fiber, from VPN to SDWAN and a phase-out of ISDN. We also intend to
supplement our stable fixed wholesale business with international carriers and Internet Service Providers by
wholeselling active services in ODF areas.


-----

**_Optimize our indirect cost base ratio_**

We have an asset-light fixed model and have been focused on creating a lean operational setup since
2016 when we completed a reorganization under the name ‘Lean Telco’ with a headcount reduction of certain
full-time equivalents and a savings target of €30 million. We further streamlined our business with a “3F – Fit
For Future” initiative in 2018-2019, having achieved our further cost savings target of €100 million during the
two year period 2018-2019. The focus in the coming years will be on optimization of our indirect cost base
(“IDC”) ratio through:

    - _Focusing on smart growth by transforming remaining legacy architecture, digitizing processes_
towards self-service, improving fixed product quality and transforming the OSS while focusing
on high-margin segments, thereby increasing our scale;

    - _Countering inflation with efficiencies by investing in marketing automation, robotic process_
automation and first-time right focus to deliver efficiency gains as they increase productivity; and

    - _Continuing to optimize costs by investing in systems and process improvements._

**_Build on our ESG commitments_**

We are committed to ESG initiatives and have made it a priority to focus on several initiatives in order
to improve our impact on the environment and society. We intend to build on our past ESG successes with a
four-pillar ESG program. Our first pillar is sustainability. In 2020, we already used 100% green electricity and
produced 60,000 kWh of renewable energy by using our own solar panels. In 2021, we introduced eco-plastic,
E-SIMs and lighter packaging. Additionally, we have targeted a reduction to carbon neutral emission level by
2026. Furthermore, we will reduce new plastic packaging to zero by 2026. We continue to be involved in our
community in other ways, such as our establishment of two partnerships to accelerate “Innovation for Society”
projects in 2020.

For 2021 and 2022, we aim to set up three impactful “Innovation for Society” partnerships to invest in
e-health, education and smart cities. Going forward, we intend to continue setting up three partnerships a year.
We also focus on digital inclusion, as our goal is to enable more people to be part of the digital society. In 2020,
more than 2,500 people gained access to the digital society with our social SIM program and we reached more
than 15,000 people through our debt prevention program. Our target is to reach more than 25,000 disadvantaged
individuals every year.

Lastly, our management aims to foster an environment in which everyone feels included. We have set
up a dedicated work stream in the diversity and inclusion program focused on activities and awareness within
the company, sharpened our policy on social return and set up a “Back to work” fund. For 2021 and 2022, our
focus is on diversity and inclusion, such as through setting up gender-neutral communication and starting the
dialogue on safety and belonging. Our goal is to be a 100% inclusive organization by 2025.

_Date, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid_
_interest and additional amounts, if any.”_

**_The Acquisition_**

On September 6, 2021, funds advised by Apax and Warburg Pincus, which together control the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, announced their intention to acquire the Target from its current shareholders, Deutsche
Telekom, the holder of 75.0% of the share capital of TMNL and Tele2 Sweden (together with Deutsche
Telekom, the “Existing Shareholders”), the holder of 25.0% of the share capital of TMNL. In this regard, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated September 6, 2021 with the
Existing Shareholders and the Target (the “Acquisition Agreement”), pursuant to which, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of the Target.

Under the Acquisition Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer at Completion Date, consists of €3,713.5 million plus €700,000 per calendar day from November 1, 2021
until the earlier of (i) the Completion Date or (ii) the date falling 15 business days after the date on which the
last completion condition under the Acquisition Agreement has been satisfied or waived, to compensate the
Existing Shareholders for additional cash generation in the Target Group during this time period. The purchase
price will be adjusted for a leakage amount, which consists of €24.0 million as re-branding costs plus the sum
of any specified item resulting in leakage of value, for example, any distribution by the Target Group to any of
the Existing Shareholders or certain affiliates parties and any payments made or amounts payable under the
SAR schemes instituted by the Target, in each case, during the period from July 1, 2021 until the date of transfer
of the shares of the Target to Senior Secured Issuer (together, the “Leakage”). In addition, the Acquisition
Agreement also specifies the manner in which the acquisition consideration payable by the Senior Secured
Issuer is to be split between the Existing Shareholders.

Under the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions,
including appropriate clearance from the antitrust and other regulatory authorities and the satisfaction of
relevant procedures with the Target’s works council. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, a number
of these closing conditions have been satisfied, and among key conditions, clearance from the Dutch Ministry
of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy under the Dutch Telecommunication Act. Depending on the timing of
the satisfaction of the remaining closing conditions, we currently expect to complete the Acquisition by January
2022. Under the Acquisition Agreement, (i) in the event that the Completion Date does not take place by March
6, 2022, each of Deutsche Telekom and Tele2 Sweden (as Existing Shareholders and sellers under the
Acquisition Agreement) will have the right to terminate the Acquisition Agreement and (ii) in the event that the
Completion Date does not take place by July 6, 2022, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (as the purchaser) will
have the right to terminate the Acquisition Agreement.

The total consideration for the Acquisition due on the Completion Date, is expected to be financed on
such date using a portion of:

    - the Shareholder Contribution of an estimated amount of €1,090.0 million;

    - the TLB drawn under the Senior Facilities Agreement; and

    - the offering of the Notes.


-----

Prior to the Completion Date, the Issuers will not have any control over the Target Group. In addition,
prior to the completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group will not be subject to the covenants described in
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and the “Description of the Senior Notes.”

**_Sources and Uses_**

We expect to receive gross proceeds of €1,350.0 million from the offering of the Notes, assuming an
issuance at par. The proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under the TLB and the
Shareholder Contribution from the Sponsors, will be used to (a) make payments under the Acquisition
Agreement (including the acquisition consideration and funds for refinancing the Existing Target Group
Facilities) and (b) pay certain costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection the Transactions, including the
offering of the Notes.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of proceeds in connection with the
Acquisition and the other Transactions. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several
factors, including the exact Completion Date, actual amount of cash at the Target on Completion Date, any
Leakages as described under “—The Acquisition,” and the difference between the estimated and actual fees and
expenses.

(6) On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis
by the Parent Guarantor. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Completion Date and in any event within the date

of the Agreed Security Principles and the applicable perfection requirements, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured on an equal
and ratable first-priority basis by an English law escrow account pledge over the SSN Escrow Account in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes. On or around the Completion Date, this security will be released and the Senior Secured Notes will be, secured on a
first-priority basis by the Initial Collateral (as defined herein), and, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Completion Date and
in any event within 150 days after the Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by the
Target Collateral (as defined herein). See “—The Offering—Collateral.”

On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis, by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Completion Date and in any event within the
date that is 150 days after the Completion Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed on a
senior subordinated basis, by the Target Guarantors. See “—The Offering—Guarantees.” On the Issue Date, subject to the operation
of the Agreed Security Principles and the applicable perfection requirements, the Senior Notes will be secured on an equal and ratable
first-priority basis by an English law escrow account pledge over the SN Escrow Account in respect of the Senior Notes. On or
around the Completion Date, this security will be released and the Senior Notes will be, secured on a first-priority basis by the Shared

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and the liability of each Guarantor and security provider
will be subject to the limitations described under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and
_Security,” “—The Offering—Guarantees,” “—The Offering—Collateral” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Notes_
_Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the_
_Collateral that has been granted or will be granted as security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be_
_sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.” By virtue of such limitations, the Guarantors’ obligations_
under the Notes Guarantees or the amounts secured by the Collateral will be significantly less than the total amounts payable with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as the case may be, or could be declared null or rescinded in certain
circumstances.

(7) Upon the release of the Senior Notes proceeds from the relevant Escrow Account, the Senior Notes Issuer will on-lend the gross
proceeds of the Senior Notes to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, pursuant to a Senior Notes Issuer Proceeds Loan. Similarly, upon
the release of the Senior Secured Notes proceeds from the relevant Escrow Account, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will on-lend to
the Target and/or other members of the Target Group a portion of (i) the gross proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes and (ii) the
proceeds from Senior Notes Issuer Proceeds Loan, which together, among others, are expected to be utilized to refinance and cancel


-----

the Existing Target Group Indebtedness and associated fees and expenses, pursuant to a Senior Secured Notes Issuer Proceeds Loan.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

(8) For the year ended December 31, 2020, on an unconsolidated basis and without giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other
adjustments in relation to consolidation, the Target Guarantors (expected to be the Target and T-Mobile Netherlands) represented (i)
92.1% of the Target Group’s net revenue and (ii) 94.3% of the Target Group’s EBITDA. For the nine months ended September 30,
2021, on an unconsolidated basis and without giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other adjustments in relation to
consolidation, the Target Guarantors represented (i) 90.3% of the Target Group’s net revenue, and (ii) 103.0% of the Target’s Group
EBITDA, which is higher than the consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group for nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily
due to negative EBITDA of some of non-Target Guarantor entities for this period. As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021,
after giving effect to intercompany eliminations attributable to share capital but not to other adjustments in relation to consolidation,
the Target Guarantors represented 117.0% and 130.0%, respectively, of the Target Group’s total assets, which are higher than the
consolidated total assets of the Target Group for the relevant periods due to the negative value of total assets at some of the nonTarget Guarantor entities as a result of operational intercompany position of these entities with the Target Guarantors, whereby, prior
to consolidation, their liabilities exceed their assets.

(9) Not all of the subsidiaries of the Group will guarantee the Notes. As of September 30, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to the
Transactions, the subsidiaries that are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have no third party financial debt outstanding. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the
_liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.”_

be made without withholding or deduction for taxes unless required by
law. If either Issuer or any Guarantor is required by law to withhold or
deduct for such taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction with respect to
a payment to the holders of Notes, such Issuer or Guarantor will pay
the additional amounts necessary so that the net amounts received by
the holders of Notes after the withholding or deduction is not less than
the amount that they would have received in the absence of the
withholding or deduction, subject to certain exceptions. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes” and
“Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

**Certain Covenants .........................** The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture

qualifications. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_

for as long as, and the security interests in respect of the Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes and in respect of the Shared

_Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement_

_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of_
_Investment Grade Status.”_

**Transfer Restrictions.....................** The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be,
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and
may only be offered or sold in the United States in compliance with
Rule 144A and outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in
reliance on Regulation S or in transactions that are exempt from or are
not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.
See “Transfer Restrictions” and “Plan of Distribution.”

**No Prior Market for the Notes .....** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no market.
Although the Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to
make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they
may discontinue market making at any time without notice.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the Notes
will develop or be maintained.

**Listing and Trading .......................** Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange and to admit the Notes to trading on the Official List of the
Exchange. There can be no assurance, however, that the Notes will be
listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal
in the Notes will be granted, or that such listing will be maintained.

**Additional Notes**

Additional Senior Secured Notes .... Subject to compliance with the covenants, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will be permitted to issue additional Senior Secured Notes
(“Additional Senior Secured Notes”), without notice to or the consent
of holders of Senior Secured Notes, which shall have terms
substantially identical to the Senior Secured Notes except in respect of
specified terms. Such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated,
along with all other Senior Secured Notes, as a single class for the
purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture with respect to
waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series. For all purposes other than United States
federal income tax purposes, Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be
deemed to form one series with any Senior Secured Notes previously
issued if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects
to such other Senior Secured Notes. Additional Senior Secured Notes
sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may at the option of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer be issued with the same ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as
Senior Secured Notes belonging to the same series previously issued
without being fungible with such series of initial Senior Secured Notes
for United States federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder
(as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States
_Federal Income Tax Considerations”) considering the purchase of_
Senior Secured Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of this
offering of Senior Secured Notes or in the secondary market, you
should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular United
States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of such Senior Secured Notes, including
with respect to the potential issuance of Additional Senior Secured
Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Senior


-----

Secured Notes for United States federal income tax purposes, but
which nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified. In
the event Additional Senior Secured Notes are issued pursuant to
Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other
securities identification number as Senior Secured Notes belonging to
the same series previously issued, without being fungible with such
series of initial Senior Secured Notes for United States federal income
tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Senior
Secured Notes that form part of that series, including in respect of
investors that hold Book-Entry Interests (as defined herein) in the
Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes (as defined herein) on or
prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Senior Secured Notes,
will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a 144A
Global Senior Secured Note (as defined herein) (if any) representing
Senior Secured Notes of that same series. Such a restriction could
adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the
Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks_

**Summary Financial Information and Other Data**

The following tables set forth our summary financial information and other data on a consolidated
basis as of the dates and for the periods indicated. The results of operations for prior fiscal years may not be
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. This summary financial information
and other data should be read in conjunction with the Historical Consolidated Financial Statements (as defined
below) and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and discussed in
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

**Financial Statements Presented**

**_Financial Information of the Issuers_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer are newly formed entities incorporated
on July 20, 2021, in each case for purposes of facilitating the Transactions and performing certain activities
related thereto. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer
and, following the completion of the Acquisition, the Target will be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuers have no revenuegenerating activities of their own, and no business operations, material assets or liabilities other than those
acquired or incurred in connection with their incorporation and the Transactions. As a result, no historical
financial information of the Issuers is included in this summary, except for certain limited “adjusted” financial
data presented on a consolidated basis, adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions and the use of
proceeds therefrom, including the impact on the cash position, the amount of debt and the interest expense of
the Group. The effects of purchase price accounting from the Acquisition have not yet been reflected in the
information presented, however, the Acquisition may have certain effects on our financial statements and may
impact our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows, which we are unable to determine
with certainty until after the Completion Date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and
_Financial Information—The preparation of our financial statements involves judgments, estimates and_
_assumptions, and changes in financial accounting standards may cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and_
_affect our reported results of operations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—We have made_
_certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition in forecasts that may prove to be materially inaccurate.”_

**_Historical Financial Information of the Target Group_**

The consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position and
consolidated statement of cash flows of the Target Group presented herein are derived from (i) the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2020, including the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the European Union and which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.
(the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, including
the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting (the “Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Historical Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering
Memorandum is derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Financial Statements”). The audited consolidated financial statements of the
Target Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were originally approved by us on December 31,
2019. Thereafter, we have restated certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31,
2018, included in the 2019 Financial Statements, by restating the classification of “other receivables” to “trade
receivables” for an amount of €619 thousand, “other payables” to “current other liabilities” for an amount of
€68,947 thousand, “non-current other liabilities” to “other liabilities” for an amount of €2,004 thousand, “other
receivables” to “other assets” for an amount of €32,629 thousand and “tax liabilities” to “liabilities held for
sale” for an amount of €1,792 thousand. These restatements do not have any impact on the reported profit for
the year 2018 or reported equity and an immaterial impact on the cash flow statement for 2018. As a result, we


-----

have not separately restated the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. See note
2.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements.

In addition, we also present certain financial information of the Target Group for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021 (the “LTM Financial Information”). Except as otherwise stated, the LTM
Financial Information is derived by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of profit
or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the
audited consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income of the Target Group for the
year ended December 31, 2020 and deducting the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of
profit or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
The LTM Financial Information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily
representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.
Except as stated otherwise, the LTM Financial Information is not prepared in the ordinary course of our
financial reporting or in accordance with IFRS.

We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) effective from January 1, 2019. As a result, leases (as lessee) that would
have been classified in previous periods as operating leases are recognized in our consolidated statement of
financial position as of December 31, 2019. Under the new standard, except for short-term or low-value leases,
the right to use a leased asset is recognized as an asset with a corresponding financial liability for the present
value of outstanding lease payments. Assets with a finite useful life are subject to impairment testing. We have
adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective method. On the transition to IFRS 16, remaining payment
obligations from existing operating leases were discounted using the relevant incremental borrowing rate and
recognized as a lease liability and the right-to-use assets were carried as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of
the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments.

As a result of the application of new accounting standards and the associated impact on our Historical
Consolidated Financial Statements, prospective investors should exercise particular caution when comparing
our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 to our financial
condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The preparation of our financial_
_statements involves judgments, estimates and assumptions, and changes in financial accounting standards may_
_cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.” For a discussion of the_
effects of the adoption of IFRS 16 on our financial condition and results of operations, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability_
_of Our Results of Operations—Adoption of IFRS 16” and note 2.4 to the 2019 Financial Statements._

After the completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group will not prepare separate consolidated
financial statements and we instead intend to report our consolidated financial results at the level of the Parent.
Due to this, our future financial statements may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial
statements included in this Offering Memorandum. Our future financial statements could be materially different
once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial
statements included in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Impacting Comparability—Reporting.”_

**Pro Forma Adjustments Related to the Tele2 and Simpel Acquisitions and T-Infra Demerger**

We completed the acquisition of Tele2 on January 2, 2019 and the acquisition of Simpel on December
1, 2020. On September 1, 2018, we completed the demerger of part of our passive equipment and part of our
rented sites to a separate legal entity, T-Infra. T-Infra was transferred to Deutsche Telekom on January 1, 2019,
and ceased to form part of our consolidated financial results from that date. In this Offering Memorandum, we
present Pro Forma Net Revenue which is based on Tele2 and Simpel’s revenues for their respective preacquisition periods (adjusted for the estimated impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16) which are added to our revenue
and adjusted for certain management reclassifications. We also present in this Offering Memorandum, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying RunRate EBITDA AcL which make certain adjustments to our EBITDA for the periods presented to take into
account the reported EBITDA contributions of Tele2 and Simpel for their respective pre-acquisition periods,
and eliminating the reported (negative) EBITDA of T-Infra (demerged business) for the relevant periods after


-----

making certain intercompany adjustments based on management reclassifications and to exclude special factors
such as pre- and post-acquisition integration and restructuring costs related to the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions,
as detailed in this Offering Memorandum.

Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL,
Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL as presented herein are not intended to
represent pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X
promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC requirements or IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles. Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL are based upon available information
and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The assumptions underlying
Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Underlying
EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL have not been audited or reviewed in accordance with
any generally accepted auditing standards. Any reliance you place on this information should fully take this
into consideration. Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL,
Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL are not prepared in the ordinary course of
our financial reporting. Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL are presented for informational
purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have
been had the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel and the de-merger of T-infra actually occurred on the dates
indicated, and they do not purport to project the results of operations or financial condition for any future period
or as of any future date.

**Non-IFRS Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain financial measures and ratios (the “Non-IFRS
**Measures”), including Pro Forma Net Revenue, EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted**
EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin, Underlying
EBITDA AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL Margin, Pro Forma Operating Free Cash Flow, Underlying Operating
Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, Capital Expenditure, Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL and Underlying
Run-Rate EBITDA AcL Margin that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting standards.

We present the Non-IFRS Measures because we believe that they are of interest to the investors and
similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as
supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our or any of our subsidiaries’ operating results as reported under
IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards.

The Non-IFRS Measures may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms governing our
indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (as described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes”), the Senior Notes Indenture (as described under “Description of the Senior Notes”) and the_
Senior Facilities Agreement (as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”). The NonIFRS Measures and ratios are not measurements of our or any of our subsidiaries’ performance or liquidity
under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the presentation of these NonIFRS Measures is not intended to, and does not comply with, the reporting requirements of the SEC and will
not be subject to review by the SEC. Therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on the Non-IFRS
Measures.

You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Historical Consolidated
Financial Statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement the evaluation of our
performance. The Historical Consolidated Financial Statements mentioned above do not indicate results that
may be expected for any future period. In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own
examination of the terms of this Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

_Memorandum includes certain non-IFRS financial measures calculated using management estimates or_
_projections and they should not be relied upon in isolation when making an investment decision.”_

We have included in this section for the convenience of the reader, certain metrics excluding the impact
of cash leases that have been impacted by IFRS 16 as the adoption of IFRS 16 has had a significant impact on
our historical financials which has impacted the comparability of some of our Historical Consolidated Financial
Statements for the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum and we believe it is of interest to investors
to present certain measures excluding such impact to facilitate like-for-like comparability between our historical
financial information during the periods under review.

**Adjusted Financial Information**

We also present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited financial information of the Group
adjusted to give effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom as if they had occurred on
September 30, 2021 for the consolidated statement of financial position data and on October 1, 2020 for our
consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income data, including the impact on our cash
position, amount of debt and interest expense (the “Adjusted Financial Information”).

The Adjusted Financial Information is not intended to represent pro forma financial information
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or
other SEC requirements or IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. The Adjusted Financial
Information is based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances. The assumptions underlying the Adjusted Financial Information have not been audited or
reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. Any reliance you place on this
information should fully take this into consideration. The Adjusted Financial Information is not prepared in the
ordinary course of our financial reporting. The Adjusted Financial Information is presented for informational
purposes only and does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have
been had the Transactions actually occurred on the date indicated, and they do not purport to project the results
of operations or financial condition for any future period or as of any future date.

The summary financial information presented below should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in “Presentation of Financial Information,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical
_Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations” as well as the Historical Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto_
appearing elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(1) Represents the sum of postpaid mobile subscribers in our B2C segment for each of our T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel brands, as
at the end of the relevant period.

(2) Represents the sum of fixed subscribers in our B2C segment for each of our T-Mobile Thuis and Tele2 brands, as at the end of the
relevant period.

(3) Represents the number of subscribers in our B2B segment, as at the end of the relevant period.

(4) Represents the sum of postpaid mobile ARPU in our B2C segment for each of our T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel brands. We
calculate B2C Mobile Postpaid ARPU by dividing the relevant B2C mobile postpaid revenue in a period by the average by number
of subscribers over that period (calculated as the average of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the period and the number
of subscribers at the end of the period), and further divided by the number of months in the relevant period. B2C mobile postpaid
revenue in a period is calculated on a pro forma basis for the Tele2 and Simpel acquisition.

(5) Represents the sum of fixed ARPU in our B2C segment for each of our T-Mobile Thuis and Tele2 brands. We calculate B2C Fixed
ARPU by dividing the relevant B2C fixed line revenue in a period by the average by number of subscribers over that period
(calculated as the average of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the period and the number of subscribers at the end of the
period), and further divided by the number of months in the relevant period. B2C fixed line revenue in a period is calculated on a pro
forma basis for the Tele2 and Simpel acquisition.

(6) Represents the sum of mobile ARPU in our B2B segment. We calculate B2B Mobile ARPU by dividing the relevant B2B mobile
revenue in a period by the average by number of subscribers over that period (calculated as the average of the number of subscribers
at the beginning of the period and the number of subscribers at the end of the period), and further divided by the number of months
in the relevant period. B2B mobile revenue in a period is calculated on a pro forma basis for the Tele2 and Simpel acquisition. During
the year ended December 31, 2020, management estimates the ARPU for SOHO/VSE to be €23.7, €16.6 for SMB and €6.1 for
LE/CE.

**Other Financial Information**

Certain financial information below has been presented on a historical pro forma basis to include the
pro forma effect of the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel, the demerger of T-Infra and the application of IFRS
16, in each case from January 1, 2018, including retrospective application of the T-Infra Master Lease
Agreement (“MLA”) and certain TMNL management reclassifications, as applicable. We present such
historical pro forma information because we believe that it facilitates like-for-like comparability between our
historical financial information during the periods under review. The LTM Financial Information presented in
this section is calculated based on monthly management accounts and monthly performance, reflecting pro
forma adjustments for the Tele2 and Simple acquisitions, the T-Infra demerger and the application of IFRS 16,
on a monthly or quarterly basis, as applicable. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” for
further details.

Pro Forma Net Revenue is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS
and is not intended to represent pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X
promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC requirements. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non_IFRS Measures.”_

of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 based on management estimates for purposes of accounting harmonization.

(b) Represents the standalone pre-acquisition revenue of Simpel, which we acquired in December 2020, adjusted for the
application of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 based on management estimates for purposes of accounting harmonization.

(c) Represents several management reclassifications, mainly related to (i) interconnected revenues that are reclassified from
TMNL to Simpel, (ii) the elimination of Simpel wholesale fees and (iii) the elimination of Tele2 wholesale fees.

(2) We define EBITDA as net profit/(loss) for the relevant period before income taxes, gain from other financial activities, net finance
costs and depreciation, amortization and impairment losses.

We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as our EBITDA adjusted for the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, the demerger of T-Infra
and certain TMNL management reclassifications, as well as to exclude special factors such as pre- and post-acquisition integration
and restructuring costs related to the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, consisting primarily of advisory costs/support, network
integration costs and severance costs.

We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to exclude the estimated impact of
IFRS 16, thereby including operating lease expenses in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in order to arrive at a closer alignment with
cash EBITDA.

We define Underlying EBITDA AcL as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, adjusted to exclude (i) certain items, which management
believes are one-off and/or non-recurring items and (ii) removal costs related to the stock appreciation right (“SAR”) scheme
introduced by TMNL in 2017.

EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL and Underlying EBITDA AcL are supplemental
measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We believe EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL and Underlying EBITDA AcL provide useful information to our management
and investors with respect to our overall operating performance by facilitating comparisons of operating performance on a consistent
basis by removing the impact of items not directly resulting from core operations. We present these Non-IFRS Measures because we
believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as
supplemental measures of performance. These Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our
operating results as reported under IFRS. See also “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—This Offering Memorandum includes certain non_IFRS financial measures calculated using management estimates or projections and they should not be relied upon in isolation when_
_making an investment decision.”_

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Simpel EBITDA adjustment consisted of (i) pre-acquisition EBITDA of Simpel of
€22.6 million, (ii) pro forma application of the estimated impact of IFRS 16 in the amount of €1.5 million and (iii) an

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Simpel EBITDA adjustment consisted of (i) pre-acquisition EBITDA of Simpel of
€24.8 million, (ii) pro forma application of the estimated impact of IFRS 16 in the amount of €1.1 million and (iii) an
intercompany adjustment for the reclassification of interconnect activities in respect of certain users that were, pre-acquisition,

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, the Simpel EBITDA adjustment consisted of (i) pre-acquisition EBITDA
of Simpel of €3.2 million, (ii) pro forma application of the estimated impact of IFRS 16 in the amount of €0.2 million and (iii)
an intercompany adjustment for the reclassification of interconnect activities in respect of certain users that were, preacquisition, users on both TMNL and Simpel networks and are post-acquisition consolidated in TMNL’s financial statements,
in the amount of €(0.1) million.

(c) On September 1, 2018, we completed the demerger of part of our passive equipment and part of our rented sites to T-Infra. TInfra was transferred to Deutsche Telekom on January 1, 2019, and ceased to form part of our consolidated financial results
from that date. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the T-Infra EBITDA adjustment consisted of (i) eliminating the reported
(negative) EBITDA of T-Infra (demerged business) of €17.9 million, (ii) inclusion of lease costs with other operating expenses
of €(51.9) million in connection with the continuing MLA and (iii) pro forma application of the estimated impact of IFRS 16
in the amount of €51.9 million.

(d) For the year ended December 31, 2018, the TMNL management reclassifications consisted of (i) pro forma application of the
estimated impact of IFRS 16 in the amount of €36.1 million, (ii) pre-acquisition period interconnect revenues that were

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the TMNL management reclassifications mainly consisted of (i) pre-acquisition period
interconnect revenues that were reclassified from TMNL to Simpel in the amount of €1.1 million, (ii) management’s estimates
for alignment of IFRS 16 assumptions for the T-Infra MLA contract in the amount of €0.3 million and (iii) an incremental


-----

amount of €(14.9) million in order to adjust for the difference between preliminary statutory adjustments and final statutory
adjustments. The difference in preliminary and final statutory adjustments is attributable to accounting differences in the
treatment of the bad debt provision, mass claim provision, SAR provision, lease incentive provisions and IFRS 16 positions as
a result of final year-end closing procedures and audit adjustments. Management has assessed the differences on a case-bycase basis and concluded that while relevant for statutory financial statements, these are non-representative for the recurring
trend of pro forma adjusted EBITDA or Underlying EBITDA for which these fluctuations represent one-off events or
differences in a given period and should be phased or time corrected to another (earlier) period.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, the TMNL management reclassifications mainly consisted of (i) preacquisition period interconnect revenues that were reclassified from TMNL to Simpel in the amount of €0.1 million, (ii)
management’s estimates for alignment of IFRS 16 assumptions for the T-Infra MLA contract in the amount of €0.1 million
and (iii) an incremental amount of €30.0 million in order to adjust for the difference between preliminary statutory adjustments
and final statutory adjustments. The difference in preliminary and final statutory adjustments is attributable to accounting
differences in the treatment of the bad debt provision, mass claim provision, SAR provision, lease incentive provisions and
IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 positions as a result of final year-end closing procedures and audit adjustments. Management has assessed
the differences on a case-by-case basis and concluded that while relevant for statutory financial statements, these are nonrepresentative for the recurring trend of pro forma adjusted EBITDA or Underlying EBITDA for which these fluctuations
represent one-off events or differences in a given period and should be phased or time corrected to another (earlier) period.

(e) Represents adjustments for certain one-off costs primarily related to pre- and post-acquisition integration and restructuring
costs related to the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions and consisting primarily of advisory costs/support, network integration costs
and severance costs.

(f) Reflects an adjustment to exclude the estimated impact of IFRS 16, thereby including operating lease expenses in Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA in order to arrive at a closer alignment with cash EBITDA.

(g) Represents certain items, which management believes are one-off and/or non-recurring items, primarily related to: (i) €7.7
million of temporary effects in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, €0.7 million of early termination fees for shops, one-off
fine of €1.4 million imposed by the Dutch ACM, €1.8 million of advisory fees related to the sale of Simpel incurred during the
pre-acquisition period, €(0.4) million of release of a previous accrual in Simpel’s pre-acquisition accounts, €0.5 million of
reversal of an out of period accrual release attributable to a discount to a wholesale partner in 2020, €0.7 million of accrual
policy change regarding catch-up carrier costs, €0.3 million of correct phasing of B2B activation costs in connection with IFRS
15, €0.7 million of correct phasing of installation cost accruals, €(0.3) million of double-booked bad debt costs during the
migration of Tele2 customers from the Tele2 systems to the TMNL systems, €(0.7) million of reversal of release of a previous
over-accrual provision in connection with Eurofiber, €0.8 million of one-off correction for administrative costs related to
recognition of VAT on electronic payments for prepaid credits, €(1.1) million of release of over-accruals for cost of goods sold
and supplier invoices in the fixed segment, €(14.9) million of release of a COVID-related bad debt provision in the third quarter
of 2021 which led to a positive one-off COVID-19 impact on Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL during the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021. These one-off or non-recurring items have been calculated based on management estimates, which
we believe are reasonable.

The COVID-19-related effects of €7.7 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 primarily comprised of

temporary effects on revenues and contribution margin, mainly driven by customer behavior such as reduced mobility, reduced
roaming charges due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions and reduced out-of-bundle usage by customers. Furthermore, we
also experienced temporarily high costs due to high utilization of call centers with our shops being closed, and additional costs
for home delivery of handsets, which negatively impacted profitability. See also “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Non-IFRS Measures” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—This_
_Offering Memorandum includes certain non-IFRS financial measures calculated using management estimates or projections_
_and they should not be relied upon in isolation when making an investment decision.”_

(h) Represents the costs associated with the SAR incentive scheme. In 2017, TMNL introduced the SAR scheme to offer eligible
employees the option to participate in an increase in the enterprise value. The full amount of expenses related to the SAR
scheme has been adjusted to provide details on the EBITDA generation of TMNL and enhance comparability with equity
based/non-cash incentive schemes.

(3) We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by Pro Forma Net Revenue, expressed as
a percentage.

(4) We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL divided by Pro Forma Net Revenue,
expressed as a percentage.

(5) We define Underlying EBITDA AcL Margin as Underlying EBITDA AcL divided by Pro Forma Net Revenue, expressed as a
percentage.

(6) We define Pro Forma Operating Free Cash Flow as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL less Capital Expenditure.

Pro Forma Operating Free Cash Flow is a supplemental measure of our liquidity that is not required by, or presented in accordance
with, IFRS. We present Pro Forma Operating Free Cash Flow because we believe that similar free cash flow measures are frequently
used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating similar issuers. Pro Forma Operating Free Cash Flow
should not be considered as a measure of cash flow from operations under IFRS or as an indicator of liquidity. Pro Forma Operating
Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as an analytical tool and
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. See also
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”

The following table shows a calculation and reconciliation of Pro Forma Operating Free Cash Flow to
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021:

(9) We define Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL as Underlying EBITDA AcL adjusted for (i) the full year effect of achieved synergies
and (ii) the full year impact of planned unrealized synergies. Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL is a supplemental measure of our
performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We believe Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL provides
useful information to our management and investors with respect to our overall operating performance. We present Underlying RunRate EBITDA AcL because we believe that it and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other
interested parties as supplemental measures of performance. Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. See also “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non_IFRS Measures” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—This Offering Memorandum_

(b) Represents management estimates of the full year EBITDA effect of the synergies that have been realized up to September 30,
2021 relating to (i) the acquisitions of Tele2, resulting in leverage integration capabilities from Tele2 and benefit from revenue
and cost synergies such as (a) decline in marketing expenses as a result of mobile cross-selling and migration to Open Dutch
Fiber, (b) reduction in other indirect costs such as personnel related costs, rental and leasing, legal audit and tax fees, (c) other
goods and services purchased, including logistics, leased lines, power, TSES outsourcing, and other services purchased, which
largely benefitted from synergies with Tele2 and (ii) the acquisition of Simpel. Certain run-rate synergies have already been
realized in 2021, such as mobile site rental reduction as a result of site consolidation (both to reduce interference and where
excess sites not needed), marketing and call center synergies and other synergies (including bad debt, centralization of
procurement functions and the Simpel management team).

(c) Represents management estimates of further planned unrealized synergies potential in respect of both Tele2 and Simpel,
including in connection with Tele2, potential synergies in respect of bad debt collections (representing improved client
acceptance and collection practices implemented upon integration with TMNL), direct and indirect cost savings related to the
discontinuance of the Tele2 network and the cancellation of leased telecommunications towers, reduction in marketing
expenses as a result of mobile cross-selling, optimization of campaigning periods, reduction in other indirect costs such as
personnel related costs as well as legal audit and tax fees. The assessment of estimated synergies is based on management
estimates and assumptions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—This Offering

**Capital Expenditure Data**

The capital expenditure data below has been presented on a historical pro forma basis to include the
pro forma effect of the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel, the demerger of T-Infra and the application of IFRS
16, in each case from January 1, 2018, including retrospective application of the T-Infra MLA, as applicable.
See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” for further details. Such historical pro forma capital
expenditure data is unavailable for the year ended December 31, 2018 since standalone capital expenditure

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before purchasing the Notes, you should consider carefully_
_the specific risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Offering_
_Memorandum. If any of the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, this could_
_have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make_
_payments on the Notes and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of the Notes. Described_
_below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum are the risks considered to be the most material, although_
_there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory, political or other_
_factors that could also have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business_
_or operations in the future. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future_
_performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This_
_Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual_
_results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various_
_factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-_
_Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is uncertain and its effect on the Dutch economy_**
**_and our customers’ behavior constitutes a threat to our business, operating results, financial condition and_**
**_prospects._**

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many countries, including The
Netherlands, have taken preventative measures to try to contain its spread. These measures have included
mandatory closure of businesses, social distancing requirements and travel restrictions, which have severely
diminished the level of economic activity around the world and in The Netherlands and have caused significant
volatility in financial markets and triggered a period of global economic slowdown, the extent and duration of
which are currently uncertain. In The Netherlands, according to CBS, Dutch gross domestic product (“GDP”)
declined by 1.7% during the first quarter of 2020 and by 8.5% in the second quarter of 2020, each relative to
the previous quarter. Growth in The Netherlands has oscillated since the second quarter of 2020, reaching 7.8%
in the third quarter of 2020, then declining by 0.1% and 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter
of 2021, respectively, and increasing by and 3.1% in the second quarter of 2021, each in comparison to the
previous quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic and the multiple waves of infections that have been recorded have
severely impacted the economies of the European Union, including The Netherlands. In particular, the World
Bank registered a contraction for the Euro area’s real GDP of 6.4% in 2020 and forecasts deeper continuing
impacts on those economies dependent on international tourism as well as those dependent on international
trade, as supply bottlenecks persist (Source: World Bank). In The Netherlands, employment and working hours
were negatively impacted, with the unemployment rate increasing by approximately 1.5% year-over-year in the
second quarter of 2020 and total working hours decreasing. After the lockdown in mid-March, hours worked
per week fell by 18%, or 6 hours per week by May of 2020 (Source: Institute of Labor Economics, Drivers of
_Working Hours and Household Income Dynamics during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Case of The_
_Netherlands). COVID-19 caseload waves and concomitant containment measures were associated with_
exceptional declines in consumer spending in two waves in 2020, reaching 17% and 12% declines in consumer
spending year-over-year in April and December of 2020, respectively (Source: CBS). The European
Commission expects the Dutch economy to rebound in the second and third quarters of 2021, leading to real
GDP growth of 3.3% year-over-year for both 2021 and 2022 (Source: European Commission, Summer 2021
_Economic forecast for Netherlands), but there can be no assurance that these recovery rates will be achieved._
Economic slowdown due to further waves of COVID-19 may result in additional or more drastic preventive
measures being imposed, which in turn may result in further declines in consumer disposable income and
spending as well as consumer confidence. These economic effects may in turn cause increases in customer
payment defaults and bad debt in respect of both our business and retail customers, and they may also cause
our business customers to delay or forego decisions to use our services, all of which may adversely impact our
business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

In response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we closed all our retail shops on March 16, 2020.
We reopened some of our shops on a shop-in-a-box concept a few days later, and by June 2020 we had reopened


-----

all our shops. However, under renewed Dutch government containment measures, we closed all our shops again
on December 15, 2020 and gradually restarted services in shops as of February 2021, with the shops fully open
as of April 28, 2021. Such measures have had an impact in the general financial condition of the companies and
workforce in The Netherlands. They have also had an impact on our business in particular as retail footprint is
an important sales channel for us, especially for the T-Mobile brand. Such closures may have affected, and may
in the future affect if they are re-imposed, important metrics such as gross adds in mobile and fixed services, or
may otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results, financial conditions and prospects.

On November 12, 2021, the Dutch government announced a new set of COVID-19 containment
measures by which, as of November 13, 2021, bars, restaurants, clothing shops and other non-essential shops
and services are required to be closed from during certain hours, gatherings at home are limited, and sporting
events will be held without spectators, among other measures. In response to continued high infection rates in
the Netherlands, on November 26, 2021, the Dutch government announced that these measures would tighten
as of November 28, 2021, for an additional three weeks at least, with non-essential shops to close between 5
PM and 5 AM daily and supermarkets to close at 8 PM daily. In addition, the Dutch government has prescribed
guidelines to maintain social distancing in shops and outlets and other mitigating measures in order to prevent
the spread of COVID-19, which may impact our ability to carry out our business and operations at normal
capacity. Terminal equipment sales, renewal and new contracts could decrease due to the additional measures
announced on November 12 and November 26, 2021, or due to any further temporary COVID-19-related
closures or restricted hours of our retail shops or due to decrease in customer demand as a result of such
measures and closures. These and similar measures may also delay the completion of our capital or
infrastructure construction projects and other operations and maintenance activities, which could result in a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See “—The
_continuity of our services strongly depends on the proper functioning of our IT and network infrastructure and_
_any failure of this infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business.”_

While we believe our operations are currently in compliance with applicable guidance, if customers
perceive our implementation of these measures to be inadequate or ineffective, we may experience lower than
expected activity at the retail stores or suffer damage to our reputation, which could have a significant adverse
effect on our business. In addition, our customers’ ability or desire to visit our physical premises may remain
weak for a significant length of time. This would affect sales of hardware such as handsets, tablets and other
accessories and other in-store purchases such as top-ups, and would also impede our ability to capture new
customers. Furthermore, the self-isolation measures imposed by the Dutch government in order to combat
COVID-19 have led to changing patterns of internet and mobile services usage. For example, mobile calling
and fixed data traffic tended to increase during lockdowns and decrease once lockdown restrictions ended. If
the Dutch government were to impose new or different containment measures, consumer patterns of interest
and mobile services usage may change in ways we cannot predict and which could negatively affect our
revenues and results of operations. Lastly, the severe national and international travel restrictions implemented
in order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic spread have also contributed to diminishing the level of economic
activity in The Netherlands, including tourism and leisure (significant contributors to the Dutch economy),
which could negatively impact our retail sales, including revenue from roaming services that have decreased as
a consequence of travel restrictions, as well as consumer confidence, investment by business and the Dutch
economy more broadly, which could in turn adversely affect our sales to both residential and business customers
across channels.

Additionally, further variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may mutate in ways
that increase transmissibility, evade the human immune system, or bypass the protection provided by vaccines,
and thereby cause governments to order travel bans and re-impose lockdowns as these variants appear. As a
result of the start of the global spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the week of November 22,
2021, governments around the world began to re-impose travel bans to southern African countries that were
seen as sources of the new variant, as cases of the new variant were detected that week in the UK and Belgium,
among other countries. Since the severity of the disease Omicron causes and the extent to which it is more
transmissible than previous widespread SARS-CoV-2 variants are presently unknown, we cannot predict the
course of future lockdowns, travel bans, and other measures that may be imposed by Dutch or other
governments to contain its spread or the spread of other SARS-CoV-2 which may appear in the future, all of
which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.


-----

Further, we cannot predict if and when customer spending and domestic travel will return to preCOVID-19 levels, and any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business on the same
terms as we did prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the last five years we have grown rapidly to become one of the largest telecommunications services
providers in The Netherlands and we continue to pursue a growth strategy to improve our business, financial
condition and results of operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor supply dislocation
which has increased job vacancies in The Netherlands (Source: CBS) and which may increase our labor costs,
decreased customer confidence and decreased consumer spending, could result in our failure to achieve our
historical growth rates. The full impact of the pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will ultimately
depend on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the
duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted, the timing and ability of vaccination
boosters, the effects and impact of variants on the vaccinated population, the duration and magnitude of its
impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending, the length of time it takes for demand and
pricing to return to pre-COVID-19 levels and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, which
are all beyond our knowledge and control.

Moreover, there are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance. For these reasons, we
cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business with any certainty nor can we
provide any assurance that COVID-19 will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations,
it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including those
relating to our significant levels of debt, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our debt obligations,
and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.

**_The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the Dutch and the global economy_**
**_and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of unknown magnitude and duration,_**
**_which may impact our liquidity and access to capital._**

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market and
other disruptions worldwide. We cannot assure you that conditions in the bank lending, capital and other
financial markets will not continue to deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, or that our access to capital and
other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms
of future borrowings, renewals or refinancing. We may be required to raise additional capital in the future and
our access and cost of financing will depend on, among others, global economic conditions, conditions in the
global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts, our prospects and our credit ratings.

In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require
incremental collateral, which may restrict our business operations or make such debt unavailable due to our
covenant restrictions then in effect. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to
fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.

We depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our operating activities,
supply capital to finance our operations and growth, make capital expenditure and manage our debt levels. The
continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and
preventive measures, could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and
could adversely affect our ability to make payments of future interest and other payments with respect to our
indebtedness and other obligations, including payments on the Notes and to fund capital expenditures, which
could negatively impact the quality of our service, our competitiveness and customer satisfaction, which could
in turn have a negative impact on our revenue, operating profit and cash flows. In addition, since we have fixed
costs which we cannot significantly or rapidly decrease when demand for our products or services decreases,
such as personnel costs and costs related to our infrastructure, any resulting decline in our revenue, particularly
in the event of a future resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a material adverse effect on our net

**_We face significant competition in each of the business segments in which we operate and competitive_**
**_pressures and shifting customer preferences could have a material adverse impact on our business._**

The Dutch telecommunications market is dynamic and competitive pressure may undercut our
business, materially negatively affecting our business, revenue and prospects. We operate in highly competitive
markets and we face significant competition in our industry which has resulted in ARPU that historically has
been, until recently, generally declining in the important B2C mobile segment across our industry. In The
Netherlands, the three main providers in the telecommunications sector are TMNL, KPN and VFZ. VFZ and
KPN currently lead the fixed internet market. We are the largest mobile telecommunications operator in The
Netherlands, as measured by number of SIMs and by revenue in the B2C mobile segment.

For our mobile and our fixed services, our competitors include, but are not limited to, KPN and VFZ.
In addition, our mobile services face competition from OTT services providers and MVNOs while our fixed
services also compete with alternative providers such as Delta, Online.nl and in B2B, Eurofiber, as well as fixed
virtual network operators. For our wholesale services, our key competitors include, but are not limited to,
wholesale providers of voice, data and fiber services. We may also face increased competition in any of these
business segments as a result of new market entrants, or legacy operators may seek to leverage their market
position to compete with us in new territories or service areas. For instance, KPN or VFZ may aggressively
compete with us in our mobile business in response to our attempts to gain market share in fixed internet
services. Competition from such companies, as well as from new entrants and new technologies, could create
downward pressure on prices across all the business lines, which could result in a decrease in ARPU, a loss of
customers or revenue generation units and a decrease in revenue and profitability. In addition, technological
developments are increasing cross-competition in certain markets, such as that between mobile and fixed-line
telephony.

In some instances, our competitors may have easier access to financing, more comprehensive product
ranges, lower financial leverage, greater financial, technical, marketing and personnel resources, larger
subscriber bases, wider geographical coverage for their networks, greater brand name recognition and
experience or longer established relationships with regulatory authorities, suppliers and customers. Some of our
competitors may have fewer regulatory burdens with which they are required to comply because, among other
reasons, they use different technologies to provide their services or are not subject to obligations applicable to
operators with significant market power.

Traditional telecommunications operators may develop an expansion policy with their main or secondtier brands based on large price discounts that generally affect all operators in the market. Certain of our main
competitors in The Netherlands may have greater financial capacity than us. This could be used to undercut
competing businesses, including us, or to invest in infrastructure or other assets that would enable our traditional
competitors to become more competitive in the market.

In order to increase our postpaid subscriber base, we must either migrate our existing prepaid mobile
customers to a postpaid plan, attract our competitors’ existing subscribers or attract new customers who did not
have a mobile telecommunications subscription before. We may face a declining rate at which we can continue
to migrate our existing prepaid customers to postpaid plans as the prepaid base decreases consistently over time,
or we may not be successful in attracting new subscriptions, or attempting to attract our competitors’ existing
subscribers may intensify the competitive pressures that we are subject to. We cannot guarantee that our
historical positive net adds numbers and leading customer satisfaction ratings (as confirmed by our increasing
TRI*M scores over the last decade, where TRI*M is a customer satisfaction metric widely adopted within the
Deutsche Telekom Group) will continue in the future. In addition, as a consequence of the COVID-19
pandemic, since the first half of 2020, the level of competition has increased as many of our competitors have
launched new promotions and offers in an attempt to tackle worsening economic conditions and declining
consumer spending, such as KPN’s Unlimited mobile promotion and fixed line portfolio changes from KPN
and VFZ. Such initiatives may adversely affect ARPU, including as a result of any potential customer retention
campaigns that we may undertake in response to such strong market competitive intensity.

Our competitors could gain competitive advantages over us through leveraging their more extensive
fixed internet networks or through joint ventures and alliances among franchises or financial investors, wireless
or private cable operators, satellite providers, local exchange carriers and other telecommunications service


-----

providers in The Netherlands that could give them increased access to financing, resources, efficiencies of scale
or the ability to provide multiple services in direct competition with us. Public-private joint ventures may also
increase competition. Any of these advantages that our competitors may hold or come to hold could make it
difficult for us to compete, for instance by making our FMC bundles less attractive relative to our competitors’
and thereby siphoning away customers from our mobile base, negatively impacting our business, revenue, and
prospects.

In our capacity as wholesale seller of mobile services, we have an arrangement with MVNOs who rely
on our network to provide services for their own customers. An MVNO arrangement generally provides less
revenue and lower margins than our other services, and as a result, a potential increase in market share of
MVNOs may reduce our margins and revenue if we fail to increase our own market share in the mobile market.
In addition, aggressive pricing from MVNOs on our network or on other networks and pressure from MVNOs
on our network for contract terms that are more favorable to them could also increase the competitive pressure
and cause our results of operations to decline. If we are unable to compete effectively with MVNOs, our
business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

The success of our business model is based on our service quality and the products currently offered
in the market as well as on continual renewal and updating of our product and service range in accordance with
the requirements and changes that arise in a highly competitive market. Our business and results of operations
may be adversely affected if we become uncompetitive as a result of failing to keep pace with changing
technology and consumer preferences. Any delay or absence in introducing a product or service range that is at
least similar to what is being offered by our main competitors could lead us to lose our competitive position in
the market and, consequently, to a decrease of our current market share, which would have a negative impact
on our revenue, operating profit and cash flows.

In addition, maintaining and developing our infrastructure and the range and quality of our services to
remain competitive in the market requires significant capital expenditure on an ongoing basis, which could
negatively impact our profitability in future periods. For instance, to remain competitive we will occasionally
need to bid for spectrum allocations at government auctions, such as at the planned 3.5 GHz 5G spectrum
auction that the Dutch government is planning for 2022. See “—Our business is capital intensive and our capital
_expenditures may not generate a positive return.” Our inability, for any reason, to fund our capital expenditure_
in the future could negatively impact the quality of our service, our competitiveness and customer satisfaction,
which could have a negative impact on our revenue, operating profit and cash flows.

New providers of mobile data and telephony services may enter the market and may benefit from more
effective or lower cost technologies that give them a competitive advantage over us in these markets. In
particular, we are facing increasing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on
new mobile VoIP, in particular OTT services, such as Facebook Messenger, FaceTime, Google Talk, Skype,
Snapchat, Viber and WhatsApp. These OTT services are often free of charge, accessible via smartphones and
allow their users to have access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services over the internet, thus
bypassing more expensive traditional voice and messaging services (SMS/MMS) provided by MNOs like us,
who are only able to charge the internet data usage for such services. With the growing share of smartphone
users in the Dutch mobile subscriber base, there are an increasing number of customers using OTT services.
All MNOs are currently competing with OTT services providers who leverage existing infrastructure and are
often not required to implement capital-intensive business models associated with traditional mobile network
operators like us. OTT service providers have in recent years become more sophisticated, and technological
developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech quality. In
addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple Inc. (“Apple”), Google Inc.
(“Google”), Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Facebook”) and Microsoft Corporation, have turned their attention to the
provision of OTT services. In the long-term, if non-traditional mobile voice and data services or similar services
continue to increase in popularity and if we, or more generally all the MNOs, are not able to address this
competition, this could cause declines in subscriber base and profitability across all of our products and services,
among other material adverse effects. In addition, we may face increasing competition from a large-scale rollout of public Wi-Fi networks by local governments and utilities, transportation service providers, new and
existing Wi-Fi telecommunications operators and others, which particularly benefits OTT services. Enhanced
fixed service infrastructure access and mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing


-----

to customers, and new technologies may enable our competitors to offer not only new or technologically
superior services, but to also offer existing standard services at lower prices. For example, in areas with slow
mobile internet service but broadband coverage, the availability of OTT services may negatively impact the
demand for mobile services subscriptions. The telecommunications services industry has undergone significant
technological development over time and these changes continue to affect our business. Such changes have had,
and will continue to have, a profound impact on consumer expectations and behavior. Our products and services
are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing
technologies. We may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological
developments. See “—If we fail to successfully adopt new technologies or services, or to respond to
_technological developments, our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover the cost_
_of investments that we have made.”_

Any inability or unwillingness to respond effectively to such competitive pressures could have a
material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments
on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_Our business is concentrated in The Netherlands, and may be adversely affected by negative economic, legal_**
**_or political developments in The Netherlands._**

Our business operates entirely in The Netherlands and all of our revenue is generated in The
Netherlands. Accordingly, our results may be adversely impacted by negative economic, legal or political
developments in The Netherlands, or by our failure to anticipate the needs and preferences of Dutch consumers
in terms of our marketing, service portfolio and strategic investments.

Any adverse developments, or even uncertainties, in this regard may adversely affect our business,
financial position, cash flows and results of operations. A deterioration in economic conditions in The
Netherlands as a result, for example, of changes in government policy, a further deterioration in global economic
conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see also “—The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our
_business is uncertain and its effect on the Dutch economy and our customers’ behavior constitutes a threat to_
_our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects” and “—The spread of the COVID-19_
_pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the Dutch and the global economy and could potentially create_
_widespread business continuity issues of unknown magnitude and duration, which may impact our liquidity and_
_access to capital” above) or a regional or global recession, could reduce or limit the growth of consumers’_
disposable income. All these factors could have a negative impact on our sales of new services and hardware
and lead some of our customers to default on their telephone, broadband and/or television bills, thus negatively
impacting our revenue.

There is also a risk that financing conditions will tighten for both private and public sectors in Europe,
or in The Netherlands in particular, as a result of renewed uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of public
finances in certain European countries, recession or other macroeconomic developments, which could increase
our cost of financing or limit our access to financing in the future, which could limit our ability to pursue new
acquisitions, improve and expand our infrastructure or otherwise implement our business plan.

In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are several potential sources of economic uncertainty
which could adversely affect the Dutch economy in particular. For example, the Dutch economy has
experienced volatility in recent years, including due to fundamental political changes to the European Union
and trade uncertainties as a result of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Additionally, Dutch market
risk arises as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, increasing gas and energy costs and
others.

**_Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, including the risk that we may not be able_**
**_to integrate newly acquired operations into our business, which may prevent us from realizing the strategic_**
**_and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and thus adversely affect our business._**

Historically, our business has grown, in part, through a number of selective acquisitions and joint
ventures that have enabled us to take advantage of existing networks, service offerings and management
expertise. In the period from 2016 to 2020 in particular, we acquired three complementary businesses. In


-----

December 2016, we acquired from VFZ the fixed-line business unit in The Netherlands, then known as
Vodafone Thuis and since rebranded as T-Mobile Thuis, which has enabled us to offer FMC B2C packages that
combine internet, television and fixed telephone. In January 2019, we acquired Tele2 from Tele2 Sweden,
which added over one million B2C SIMs and over 300,000 B2C and B2B fixed subscribers to our business. In
December 2020, by acquiring Complex Bidco B.V., we acquired Simpel, which added a budget brand with over
one million B2C SIMs. In April 2021, we entered into an agreement to serve as the anchor tenant of a new fiber
network that is projected to extend to over one million homes passed in The Netherlands by Roots OpCo B.V.
(“Open Dutch Fiber”), a joint venture between KKR and DTCP. In May 2019, we entered into an agreement
with Primevest Capital Partners and Koninklijke VolkerWessels B.V (“VolkerWessels”) by which we will
serve as an anchor tenant on an FTTH, a high-speed internet network that Primevest Capital Partners and Volker
Wessels will build. Following the pilot of this partnership in The Hague’s Segbroek area, the consortium will
build fiber networks in The Hague’s Loosduinen area as well as Eindhoven and Rotterdam. This network is
expected to extend to over 130,000 homes passed by mid-2022.

We may undertake further acquisitions, joint ventures or other synergistic transactions in the future, in
addition to pursuing organic growth through increased customer numbers and increased penetration of our
services and products among our existing customer base. Any acquisition, disposal or other strategic transaction
we may undertake in the future could result in us incurring additional debt or contingent liabilities, in addition
to post-completion liabilities, increased interest expenses and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and
other intangible assets. In particular, any target that we acquire may have liabilities that we failed or were unable
to discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigations. We may learn of additional information
about the target companies that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating
to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we could become liable for overdue payables
to suppliers and employees that are not known to us at the time of the acquisition, or we could become subject
to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of
which we underestimated. In conducting our due diligence, we rely on resources available to us, including
public information and information provided by the sellers and third-party advisers. In addition, our due
diligence usually provides for materiality thresholds, a limited scope and a restricted perimeter. There can be
no assurance that the due diligence we undertake reveals or highlights all relevant facts necessary or helpful in
evaluating future acquisitions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to the adequacy or accuracy of
information provided during the due diligence exercise. The due diligence process is inherently subjective. If
the due diligence investigation failed to identify material information regarding the business we plan to acquire,
we may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan or incur
impairment or other charges. Similarly, the materialization of certain risks, which may or may not have been
identified during due diligence, may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and, potentially, subsequent
contractual and statutory liability to various parties.

Any of these events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes.
Furthermore, the acquisitions of certain companies may constitute a change of control under agreements entered
into by such companies, and may entitle these third parties to terminate their agreements with us or, in some
cases, request adjustments and financing arrangements of the terms of the agreements. We cannot exclude the
possibility that some of these third parties may exercise their termination, adjustment or other rights, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position following any
such acquisition. In addition, some of the third parties may use their termination or adjustment rights to
renegotiate the terms of the agreements to our detriment and may benefit from stronger bargaining power, as a
result of which the acquired company may only be able to secure replacement contracts on less favorable terms
or at all.

In addition, it cannot be guaranteed that we will have sufficient resources to fund any acquisitions in
the future, which would limit our growth potential, or we may use available cash on hand to finance any such
acquisitions, which may impact our ability to make capital expenditures or payments on the Notes. We may
experience difficulties in integrating the businesses we acquire into our business, incur higher than expected
costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of such acquisitions, or fail to retain key
customers, employees and management personnel of the relevant targets. For example, we may fail to achieve
the anticipated operational synergies under our acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel or our separation from


-----

Deutsche Telekom, or the costs we incur in trying to realize these synergies and other benefits described herein
may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh any benefit. Further, the anticipated
total run-rate synergy potential of €139 million by 2024 which we have identified in respect of Tele2 and
Simpel, may not be achievable within the anticipated timelines or at all and there may be significant costs
associated with achieving such synergies. Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and
new employees, customers and suppliers. Further, the attention of our managers may be distracted from existing
operations by such acquisition processes and the integration of the acquired businesses, especially for material
acquisitions. Such acquisitions may also raise regulatory compliance issues. We may face difficulty integrating
a newly-acquired company into our data protection compliance framework, and we may become liable for
regulatory compliance issues with respect to the acquired company relating to events that took place before our
acquisition of it. For example, in September 2019, we were fined by the ACM for alleged violations of our
website information obligations that in part related to Tele2’s website offerings in a period both before and after
we completed our acquisition of Tele2. For further information, see “—Risks Relating to Legislative and
_Regulatory Matters—We face risks arising from the outcome of various criminal, civil, administrative and_
_regulatory proceedings.” Thus, if we consummate any further acquisitions or fail to integrate previous_
acquisitions, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing business acquisitions or
integrating previously acquired companies. In addition, our debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to
finance any future transactions, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance
our overall operations.

Acquisitions or disposals of additional telecommunications companies may require the approval of
governmental authorities (either domestically or at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or
delay the process which could result in a failure to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at
all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them
in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger
transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of
operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although we analyze and conduct due diligence on acquisition targets, our assessments are subject to
a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations and our
inquiries may fail to uncover relevant information. There can be no assurance that our assessments or due
diligence of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments
may differ significantly from our expectations, especially in light of the severe economic uncertainty and
unpredictability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in
the future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities. Our competitors may also follow similar
acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to
accept less favorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring businesses that we target
to the benefit of our competitors.

For further information regarding our acquisitions and joint ventures, see “Summary—Overview,”
“Business—Material Contracts” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Demerger and_
_Other Arrangements.”_

**_Our business is capital intensive and our capital expenditures may not generate a positive return._**

Our business is capital intensive and requires significant levels of investment. Like other companies
in the fixed line, mobile and internet services sector, we must continually invest in order to develop, expand
and maintain our network infrastructure. Although we maintain what we believe is a sufficient budget for capital
expenditures, our business demands significant capital expenditures to improve, expand and maintain our
networks and improve the scope and quality of our service, including expenditures relating to equipment and
labor. We incur significant capital expenses for the deployment of new technologies, for the purchase of
frequencies and the deployment of network infrastructure for our mobile operations and for our fixed line
operations. In particular, obtaining access to 3.5 GHz 5G spectrum through the Dutch government auction
planned for 2022 (subject to possible delays) would likely require significant capital expenditure on our part,
as measured against industry benchmarks. For further discussion of the planned 2022 5G spectrum auction, see


-----

“—Our existing services’ future network capacity growth may be constrained by the frequency spectrum
_available to us.” With respect to fixed internet services, although we do not own our own network and are not_
responsible for investment in the passive infrastructure of the networks that we use, namely KPN’s copper, fiber
WBA or optical distribution framework (“ODF”) access networks, along with the Open Dutch Fiber and
Primevest fiber networks, provision of fixed internet services to our customers will require investments in
customer premises equipment such as modems, routers and TV equipment. Although we do not presently
anticipate a need to build our own fixed network, in order to effectively compete against our competitors in The
Netherlands, it remains possible that in the future we may also need to build our own such network, for example,
a fiber optic network. Such unanticipated future needs could involve significant expenditures. We may also
need to make investments to provide business continuity and to meet requirements for information security and
disaster recovery, all of which could require significant capital expenditures which could be further increased
by applicable regulations requiring increased levels of the technical protection of telecommunications networks.

In addition, costs associated with the licenses and spectrums that we need to operate our existing
networks and technologies and those that we may acquire or develop in the future, as well as costs and rental
expenses related to their deployment, could be significant. The amount and timing of our future capital
requirements may differ materially from our current estimates due to various factors, many of which are beyond
our control. See also “—Our existing services’ future network capacity growth may be constrained by the
_frequency spectrum available to us.”_

Furthermore, new technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth
requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make
additional investments to increase the capacity of their infrastructures. It cannot be guaranteed that we will
continue to have sufficient resources to maintain the quality of our network and our other products and services,
or to expand our network coverage, which are key elements for our strategy and growth over the long-term.
Unforeseen investment expenses, an inability to generate sufficient cash flows and/or finance our capital
expenditure needs at an acceptable cost or an inability to make profitable investments could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the
Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_We may not generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital expenditures and ongoing operations and to_**
**_service our debt obligations._**

Our ability to service our debt and to finance our capital expenditure needs and operations in progress
will depend on our ability to generate cash flows. We cannot provide any assurance that our business will
generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in
an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt obligations when due, sustain our operations or meet our other
capital requirements. Our ability to generate cash flow and to finance our capital expenditures, current
operations and debt service obligations depends on numerous factors, including:

    - our future operating performance;

    - the demand and price levels for our current and projected products and services;

    - our ability to maintain the level of technical capacity required on our networks and the
subscriber equipment and other pertinent equipment connected to our networks;

    - our ability to successfully introduce new products and services;

    - our ability to limit customer churn;

    - the general economic conditions and other circumstances affecting consumer spending;

    - competition;

    - sufficient distributable reserves, in accordance with applicable law; and


-----

    - legal, tax and regulatory developments affecting our business.

Some of these factors are beyond our control. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows, we
might not be able to repay our debt, expand our business, respond to competitive challenges or finance our cash
and capital requirements, including capital expenditures. If we are not able to meet our debt service obligations,
we might have to sell off assets, attempt to restructure or refinance our existing debt or seek additional financing
in the form of debt or equity. We may not be able to do so in a satisfactory manner, or at all, which would have
a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make
payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_Our customer churn rate may increase._**

Customer churn occurs when a customer discontinues service with us, whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, such as a customer switching to a competitor or going out of business. Changes in the economy,
increased competition from other providers, or issues with the quality of service we deliver can impact our
customer churn rate. We cannot predict future pricing by our competitors, and if our competitors were to lower
their prices, such lowering could contribute to an increase in customer churn. We cannot predict the timing,
duration or magnitude of any deteriorated economic conditions or its impact on our target of customers. Higher
customer churn rates could cause our net adds rate to decline and adversely affect our revenue growth. A
sustained and significant growth in the churn rate could have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_Our existing services’ future network capacity growth may be constrained by the frequency spectrum_**
**_available to us._**

Mobile network capacity is to a certain extent limited by the amount of frequency spectrum available
for its use. Since the Dutch government controls the allocation of frequency spectrum to telecommunications
operators in The Netherlands, the capacity of our mobile network is limited by the amount of spectrum that we
are able to procure via public auction or private sale. We cannot assure you that we will be able to procure more
spectrum, renew spectrum upon the expiry of our spectrum licenses or otherwise maintain our existing spectrum
licenses, including as a result of our non-compliance with any commitments pursuant to concession agreements.
See also “—Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters—Any failure to comply with license
_conditions may jeopardize our licenses, which are required to operate our business and our networks.”_

As spectrum auctions are infrequent and spectrum licenses are of long duration, and we may anticipate
a need for additional spectrum in order to secure future capacity, we may therefore participate in future spectrum
auctions even though we might not, at the time of the auction, require additional spectrum capacity. Such
participation would require significant capital expenditures upon participation in the auction, due in part to the
fact that spectrum availability is limited and the process for obtaining it is complex, both of which tend to make
spectrum licenses expensive. For a description of mobile spectrum licenses we currently own, see “Business—
_Licenses.”_

In particular, to accommodate anticipated customer growth and our provision of 5G services over the
next five years, we believe that we may need to obtain sufficient 5G spectrum allocation from the auction of
3.5 GHz spectrum that the Dutch government had planned for April 2022, but which is likely to be delayed. We
plan to participate in that auction when it occurs. However, it is still uncertain both when the 3.5 GHz spectrum
auction will take place and when the licenses to be distributed in that auction would become operational. On
June 30, 2021, in the course of a lawsuit brought by Inmarsat Solutions B.V., the Rotterdam district court issued
an interim injunction that has suspended the change in the National Frequency Plan associated with the planned
3.5 GHz spectrum auction. The main proceedings of this suit are expected to occur in the course of 2021 and a
decision is expected in the first half of 2022, subject to possible delays. As the auction cannot occur until the
proceedings are resolved, a delay in the auction is likely. Additionally, the date on which the spectrum licenses
from this planned auction would become operational, currently scheduled for September 1, 2022, may also be
delayed. We cannot predict the length of the delay in the auction or in the date on which the licenses from the
auction will become operational. Any such delays could constrain our future network capacity growth as well
as our business and prospects. Furthermore, even if the auction were to take place in 2022, whether we acquire
a sufficient spectrum allotment as well as the consideration required for that allotment both depend upon a
competitive bidding process, and success is not guaranteed.


-----

We may also need additional spectrum to accommodate future customer growth or to further develop
our mobile internet services, and the quality of spectrum available to us may affect our competitive position.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional spectrum that would meet our expectations or
business needs on a timely basis, which could affect our network expansion or upgrade plans. This could in turn
constrain our future network capacity growth and our market share, which would in turn materially and
adversely affect our business and prospects as well as our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our growth prospects depend on continued demand for fixed line, mobile and broadband products and_**
**_services and increased demand for bundled and premium offerings._**

The use of the internet, television and fixed line telephony and mobile communication services in The
Netherlands has increased in recent years. We have benefited from this growth and our growth and profitability
depend, in part, on continued demand for these services in the coming years. We rely in part on our ability to
market mobile, TV, broadband, unified communication and other Information and Communications
Technology (“ICT”) partner services as well as a combination of these services through bundled offerings to
attract new customers and to migrate existing customers to such services. If demand for such products and
services does not increase as expected, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Conversely, if the use of telecommunication services increases more than
expected (as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other unexpected event), the increase in traffic would
require prompt action on our end to expand our network’s capacity so as to ensure connectivity and be able to
successfully meet the increased demand for our services. If we are unable to meet such increasing demand, we
may lose existing or potential customers to our competitors. Additionally, any substantial increase of customer
demand for data traffic, in particular broadband data traffic, over forecast levels could result in increased
additional costs of making services available to our customers, which, despite synergies arising from
acquisitions (such as that of Tele2) or efficiencies resulting from increased scale, could have a material adverse
effect on the profitability of our business

In addition, there is a risk that new technologies may undermine demand for our services. For example,
new wireless internet services being developed by Amazon, SpaceX or other providers could reduce demand
for fixed line broadband and telephony in the future. Furthermore, the products and services we offer may be
more successful than we anticipate, and we may be unable to meet the demand for our product offerings. We
are also affected by shifts in consumer preferences, which continue to evolve rapidly to respond to the
challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it is possible that customers could come to rely
more on VoIP and OTT services as a substitute for traditional voice and messaging services. If these consumer
trends continue, the growing demand for such services could threaten our competitive advantage and have a
material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments
on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by restrictions on our ability to maintain existing network_**
**_infrastructure or install new network infrastructure._**

The coverage of our network depends in part on our ability to maintain existing antennas and to build
up new antennas for our network. The antennas we use for our network are generally built on land owned by
third parties, the use of which is secured by way of lease agreements. In particular, we have (directly or through
Cignal Infrastructure) entered into various lease arrangements relating to certain locations where our nodes are
situated, as we only own the sites for part of the nodes that deliver our services to our customer base. These
agreements have been entered into with various landlords and are crucial for our business. There can be no
guarantee that these agreements will be extended or renegotiated on commercially favorable terms upon the
expiration of their respective terms, or that they will be extended at all. If it is not possible to renew the current
lease agreements for antenna sites and/or to enter into new lease agreements for suitable alternate antenna sites,
this could have a negative impact on the coverage of our network. Additionally, some of the equipment used in
our network is installed on customer premises. Disputes with these customers or legal proceedings involving
their property may subject this equipment to encumbrances or cause it to be inaccessible, which could adversely
affect our ability to operate our network in those areas. Further, our inability to successfully and timely resolve
such disputes could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

Furthermore, certain regulatory approvals, such as new build permits, may be required to operate
antenna sites with other frequencies/frequency bands, in particular where the shift is made from a higher
frequency band (e.g. 2100 MHz) to a lower frequency band (e.g. 1800 MHz) and new technologies such as 5G
and adaptive antennas. To the extent that we seek to operate antenna sites with other frequencies/frequency
bands and technologies, failure to obtain such regulatory approvals could have a negative impact on the future
coverage or capacity of our network and/or the availability of certain technologies in the areas concerned.
Current initiatives from certain activist groups against 5G deployment and the construction of more antennas
with higher frequency emissions, and the reaction of some politicians and authorities on a provincial and
municipal level may result in more effort and costs and a resulting delay for the roll-out of our network. This
concerns not only new sites and 5G, but also impacts upgrades on existing sites and former technologies as 3G
and 4G. Any such negative impact on the coverage of our network could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our industry may be subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect our_**
**_earnings._**

While we generally attempt to reflect increases in operating costs in our subscription rates, there is no
assurance that we will be able to do so due to competitive pressure and other factors. Therefore, operating costs
may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flow and results of
operations. For example, our operating costs could increase as a result of higher energy costs (whether due to
increased network usage and customer traffic or higher energy prices), higher costs to attract or retain employees
as a result of labor market conditions, higher payments to providers of TV services or in the event of the review
and increase of the fees paid to Dutch authorities for their supervision of telecommunications activities or for
our spectrum licenses. We are also affected by inflationary increases that may occur as a result of recovery of
economy post COVID-19 in payment obligations under supply contracts or in salaries, wages, benefits and
other administrative costs which we may not be in a position to pass on to our customers, which in turn could
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make
payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_We depend on certain key partners and other third parties for the provision of hardware, software and other_**
**_providers of outsourced services, who may discontinue their services or products, seek to charge us prices_**
**_that are not competitive or choose not to renew contracts with us._**

We have important relationships with several suppliers of hardware, software and related services that
we use to operate our broadband internet, fixed line, mobile and internet services businesses. Any future
shortages may involve significant delays in seeking alternative supplies, may constrain our ability to meet
customer demand and may result in increased customer churn. Further, in the event that hardware or software
products or related services are defective, it may be difficult or impossible to enforce recourse claims against
suppliers, especially if warranties included in contracts with suppliers have expired or are exceeded by those in
our contracts with our subscribers in individual cases, or if the suppliers are insolvent, in whole or in part. In
addition, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain the hardware, software and services we need
for the operation of our business in a timely manner, at competitive terms and in adequate amounts.

We also outsource some of our support services, including parts of our customer support services,
information technology support, technical services and maintenance operations. For instance, we rely upon
Salesforce for our customer relationship management system and B2B contract approval flow. Should any of
these arrangements be terminated by either contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions to our
operations, thus potentially harming our reputation, and could result in us incurring additional costs, including
if the outsourcing counterparty increases pricing or if we are required to locate alternative service providers or
in-source previously outsourced services.

Further, we are dependent on certain suppliers with respect to our mobile services whom we may not
be able to replace without incurring significant costs, such as Huawei, Eurofiber and Cignal Infrastructure. For
more information about our relationship with Huawei, see “Business—Suppliers.” A cessation or interruption
in the supply of the products and/or services may harm our ability to provide our mobile services to our
subscribers. Among other considerations, in April 2021, Dutch mobile operators received a decision from the
Dutch government on the basis of which Chinese vendors are restricted from supplying specific components to


-----

the core mobile network and service platforms of Dutch telecom providers. Mobile operators have been given
a transition period to replace the current equipment and the transition period is in line with TMNL’s usual
replacement cycle. However, there can be no assurance that further regulatory restrictions in The Netherlands,
in addition to the Telecommunications Security and Integrity Decree of November 2019 and the additional rules
of October 2021 (Regeling veiligheid en integriteit telecommunicaite), will not result in restrictions on our or
our commercial partners’ access to or use of such equipment and service platforms and, given the limited
availability of alternative manufacturers, could limit the supply of the components necessary for development
of a 5G network in The Netherlands. In particular, in the context of our 5G network deployment, it is possible
that we could face a lack of supply of 5G chipsets, whether as a direct result of our inability to rely on certain
suppliers or as a result of a general shortage of chipsets. Although we have preemptively ordered additional
handsets in response to the chipset shortage, there is no guarantee that our efforts to mitigate the impact of such
shortage will be successful. In the eventuality that the ban on Chinese suppliers is made more extensive in
scope, it is also possible that we may need to replace additional equipment in our network. Our inability to rely
on certain suppliers in such circumstances could negatively impact our expansion plan, including by increasing
costs related to the expansion plan. In addition, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in
supply chain delays and travel restrictions on our employees, contractors or suppliers, potentially for an
extended period of time, which could negatively impact our ability to source equipment or services in a timely
and cost effective manner.

Furthermore, either directly or through buy-in as central purchasing company, we have relationships
with a number of key sourcing partners for mobile network equipment, network roll-out, fixed access and
software, handsets, routers and other equipment such as Eurofiber, Cignal Infrastructure, Nokia, Koning &
Hartman, Ericsson and Cisco.

Our ability to both maintain and renew our existing contracts with key partners and suppliers of
products or services or enter into new contractual relationships with these or other suppliers upon the expiration
of existing agreements, either on commercially attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and
operational factors and events which may be beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these risks or a
significant disruption in our supply of equipment and services from key sourcing partners could create technical
problems, damage our reputation, result in the loss of customer relationships and have a material adverse impact
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the
trading price of the Notes.

**_We depend on third parties to provide premium programming for the pay TV service and conditional access_**
**_systems._**

We do not produce any of our television content and therefore our ability to compete in the pay TV
market depends on the ability to obtain attractive programming from third parties at reasonable prices. A
relatively small number of third-party companies produce and control access to programming in The
Netherlands. If we are unable to purchase content at commercially reasonable prices, or at all, our ability to
retain and grow our customer base could be adversely affected.

**_The continuity of our services strongly depends on the proper functioning of our IT and network_**
**_infrastructure and any failure of this infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

The reliability and quality (both in terms of service as well as availability) of our information systems
and networks, particularly for our mobile and fixed line businesses, are key components of our business
activities, the continuity of our services and the confidence of our customers. More specifically, the
unavailability or failure of information systems we use, our network, the production of “electronic”
communications services and television, our website, and our customer service function, could significantly
disrupt our business. Capital expenditure will be required to ensure sufficient security is maintained in respect
of any legacy technologies we rely on as they approach the “end of life” stage of their life cycle, as well as for
technologies that have been rendered obsolete as a result of technological, market or regulatory changes, and to
ensure a smooth transition to supported replacements. A failure to adequately support legacy systems and to
properly procure their replacement may result in a negative impact on the provision of services to customers,
resulting in a loss of existing customers and making it more difficult to attract new customers, as well as an
increased likelihood of data security incidents.


-----

A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus
or other catastrophe affecting a portion of our network could have a material adverse impact on our business
and our relations with customers. For instance, fears connected with the expansion of 5G technology in The
Netherlands may have contributed to several arson or sabotage attacks on several Dutch mobile towers in 2020
and 2021, including some of our own. Measures with the aim of remedying any such disasters, safety and
security measures, or measures for protecting service continuity that we undertake or may undertake in the
future, as well as the effects thereof on the performance of our network, could be insufficient to avoid losses.
Any disaster or other damage affecting our network could result in significant uninsured losses. Our network
may be subject to disruptions and to significant technological problems, and such difficulties could escalate
over time. The occurrence of any such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for
customers, either of which could reduce our revenue, cause us to incur additional expenses or lose customers.
Our business depends on certain sophisticated critical systems, including its network operations center
(“NOC”), call center and billing and customer service systems. The hardware supporting those systems is
housed in a relatively small number of locations and if damage were to occur to enough of these locations (e.g.,
from a fire or flood) or if those systems develop other problems, there could be a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of any such event
may subject us to penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators and damages, such as compensation to
customers affected by long service interruptions.

While we have backup systems, the risk that these systems may not be sufficient to handle a spike in
activity cannot be ruled out, which could lead to a slowdown or unavailability of IT systems for a period of
time. Moreover, we may incur legal penalties and reputational damages to the extent that any accident or
security breach results in a loss of or damage to customers’ data or applications or the inappropriate disclosure
of confidential information.

Furthermore, the development of the resources used by consumers (for example, videoconferencing,
telepresence, and cloud computing for business customers), of the “internet of things,” and of new terminals
(such as smartphones and tablets) may result in a risk to our networks of saturation due to the large volumes of
data generated by such resources. See also “—Our growth prospects depend on continued demand for fixed
_line, mobile and broadband products and services and increased demand for bundled and premium offerings”_
above.

Should all or some of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of
the Notes. See also “—Our business is subject to risks of natural disasters, fire, power outages and other
_catastrophic events that can be further intensified due to the developing threat of climate change” and “—Risks_
_Relating to Our Separation from Deutsche Telekom.”_

**_Our financial condition and operating results will be negatively affected if we experience high fraud rates_**
**_or unauthorized access to our network._**

Our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including any fraud related to
device financing, customer payment cards, third-party dealers, employees, subscriptions, service abuse that
results in the unpaid use of our networks, or account takeover fraud. For instance, in February and March of
2021, several third parties fraudulently gained access to the T-Mobile partner portal and used that access to
carry out ‘SIM swaps’ in which they transferred some of our customers’ mobile phone numbers to another SIM
card. Although we have taken technical and procedural measures to prevent such SIM swaps in the future, if
our fraud strategies and processes are again not successful in detecting, mitigating, and preventing fraud, the
resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and operation results. This includes fraudulent activities perpetrated directly against us or through the systems,
processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others.

Further, we may incur costs and revenue losses associated with the misuse of subscriptions resulting
in unauthorized and/or unpaid use of our networks, including administrative and capital costs associated with
the unpaid use of our networks as well as with detecting, monitoring and reducing the incidences of fraud. Fraud
could also impact interconnection costs, capacity costs, administrative costs and payments to other carriers for
unbillable fraudulent roaming charges.

**_A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption or financial loss._**

The telecommunications industry is generally dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day
operations. The performance and reliability of our IT systems and facilities, our networks and our fixed line
and mobile telecommunication services, are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and meet our
regulatory service obligations. These include sophisticated critical facilities and systems such as IP routers,
exchanges, switches, transmission systems, other key network points, data centers and core billing and customer
service systems.

As dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or
unintentional events, have also increased, as have the severity and sophistication of such incidents. Cyberattacks may include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for the purposes of misappropriation of
assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, causing operational disruption and more.

Our mobile and fixed networks as well as our IT systems may also become the target of cyber-attacks
that could result in the unauthorized access, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, leakage or destruction of
proprietary or other information, or other disruption of our business operations. For instance, like many other
companies, some of our customers’ user accounts have been affected by ‘credential stuffing’ attacks in which
third parties with unlawful intent use login credentials that were disclosed as a result of other data breaches
unrelated to our company to gain unauthorized access to those user accounts. Although we have improved our
detection and response capabilities to counter the threat of such attacks, and although we actively impress upon
our customers the importance of changing passwords and of two-factor authentication, there is no effective way
to prevent such attacks from successfully gaining access to user accounts in the future. In addition, certain cyber
incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. A cyber incident involving our
mobile or fixed networks, IT systems, or related infrastructure, or those of our business partners, could disrupt
our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:

    - leakage or corruption of data, such as sensitive information, consumer data, configuration files
etc.;

    - a cyber-attack on any of our networks or on a power grid could cause operational disruption
resulting in loss of revenues;

    - a cyber-attack on or unauthorized access to any of our operational systems could result in
operational failures or unauthorized changes to our customers’ services;

    - a cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could
delay or halt some of our operations;

    - a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of noncompliance
which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties or cause delays in scheduled payments of
principal or interest;

    - business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management
and damage to our reputation.

Breakdowns in IT or operating systems and security failures, such as those caused by unauthorized
access to any of our computer systems or those of our business partners, may cause interruptions and damage
to the systems supporting their business activity, interruption and in extreme cases even the discontinuation of
telecommunications services, or loss of information, and may result in the incurrence of material costs for the
recovery of such systems, which could adversely affect our costs, income, and results of operations.

As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to
modify or enhance our protective measures and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.

**_Because we have historically maintained a significant supply of inventories in our retail stores, we may be_**
**_subject to employee and third-party robberies, burglaries, thefts and looting, and our withdrawal of our_**
**_merchandise from our stores as a result may have a material adverse impact on merchandise sales._**

We have historically maintained a significant supply of valuable inventories in most of our stores to
enable customers who purchase a device along with a mobile subscription to use their device and mobile
services immediately. As a result of holding such shop inventory, we are subject to the risk of robberies,
burglaries, thefts and looting. Although we have implemented various programs in an effort to reduce these
risks, maintain insurance coverage for robberies, burglaries and thefts and utilize various security measures at
our facilities, robberies, burglaries, thefts and looting could lead to losses and shortages and could have a
material adverse effect on us. In particular, in response to an increase in robberies at mobile phone stores in The
Netherlands, we have removed some valuable merchandise from our stores and implemented procedures by
which customers at retail stores order items to be delivered to their homes. This change could lead to a loss of
sales if these procedures discourage customers who prefer to take items away with them from the store.

It is also possible that violent crimes such as armed robberies may be committed at our stores. We
could experience liability or adverse publicity arising from such crimes. For example, we may be liable if an
employee, customer, guard or bystander suffers bodily injury or other harm. Any such event may have a material
adverse effect on us.

**_If we fail to successfully adopt new technologies or services, or to respond to technological developments,_**
**_our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover the cost of investments that we_**
**_have made._**

Our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and
services to meet customer demand at competitive prices, and it is difficult to forecast the impact such
technological innovations will have on our business. If any new or enhanced technologies, products or services
that we introduce fail to achieve broad market acceptance or experience technical difficulties, our revenue
growth, margins and cash flows may be adversely affected. As a result, we may not recover investments that
we make in order to deploy these technologies and services. Enhanced fixed service infrastructure access and
mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing to customers, and new technologies
may enable our competitors to offer not only new or technologically superior services, but to also offer existing
standard services at lower prices. We may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace
with technological developments. Our ability to respond to and keep pace with technological developments
may also be strained as a result of the preventive measures taken by the Dutch government in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, which have forced many of our employees to work remotely for prolonged periods of
time, thereby halting the progress of our “on-the-field” projects. It is possible that alternative technologies that
are more advanced than those we currently provide may be developed. We may not obtain the expected benefits
of our investments if more advanced technologies are adopted by the market. Technological developments may
also shorten product life cycles and facilitate convergence of various segments in the telecommunications
industry. Even if we adopt new technologies in a timely manner, the cost of such technologies may exceed their
benefits. We may also be required to incur additional marketing and customer service costs in order to retain
existing customers and attract them to any upgraded products and services we offer, as well as to respond to
competitors’ advertising pressure, and potentially more extensive marketing campaigns, which may adversely
affect our margins.

We must continue to increase and improve the functionality, availability, and characteristics of our
network, particularly by improving its bandwidth capacity and its 4G and/or 5G coverage to meet the growing
demand for the services that require very-high-speed telephony and internet services as the telecommunications
industry. Regarding 5G frequencies, we have 700 MHz and 1,400 MHz frequencies and we plan to bid for
further spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band expected to be auctioned in 2022. However, our decision on whether to
participate in the auction may be affected by the timing of the auction, which is currently uncertain, and any
potential restraints on usage which may result from the lawsuit initiated by Inmarsat Solutions B.V. which has
suspended the National Frequency Plan as well as local usage of the same spectrum. See “—Our existing
_services’ future network capacity growth may be constrained by the frequency spectrum available to us.” If for_
any reason we do not participate in the 3.5 GHz auction and we do not obtain additional 5G spectrum, our
competitive position may be materially adversely affected.


-----

In addition, we may not receive the necessary licenses to provide services based on these new
technologies in the markets we operate in or may be negatively impacted by unfavorable regulation regarding
the usage of these technologies. If we are unable to effectively anticipate, react to or access technological
changes in the telecommunications market or to otherwise compete effectively, we could lose subscribers, fail
to attract new subscribers or incur substantial costs and investments to maintain our subscriber base, all of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any of the above occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_Failure to protect our image, reputation and brands could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

The brands under which we sell our products and services, including T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel
are well-recognized brands in The Netherlands. We developed our brands through extensive marketing
campaigns, website promotions, customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks.
For a description of our brands and offers, see “Business—Overview.”

Our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance the image and reputation of our existing
brands, products and services and to develop a favorable image and reputation for any new brands, products
and services. The image and reputation of our brands, products and services may be adversely affected by
several factors, including if concerns arise about (i) the quality, reliability and benefit/cost balance of our
products and services, (ii) the quality of our customer service and support, (iii) our ability to deliver the level
of service advertised, including in relation to connectivity and network speeds, (iv) our employees’ adherence
to customer service standards, (v) managing and reducing our carbon footprint, supply chain management, and
diversity, human rights, and support for local communities and (vi) our compliance with applicable laws,
including privacy laws and policies regarding the processing of personal data. For example, in September 2019,
the ACM fined several Dutch telecommunications companies, including us, for allegedly providing incorrect
and unclear information to consumers about their offers on their websites. Additionally, we are currently being
investigated by the Radiocommunications Agency Netherlands (“AT”) (Agentschap Telecom) regarding
alleged breaches of data protection and/or telecommunications laws in connection with a pilot program in which
we shared certain aggregated and pseudonymized customer location data with CBS under a temporary
partnership with CBS that terminated at the end of 2020. We are currently awaiting receipt of the AT’s
investigative report on this matter. For further details, see “Business—Legal Proceedings.” An event or series
of events that threatens the reputation of one or more of our brands, or one or more of our products could have
an adverse effect on the value of such brands or services and subsequent revenue therefrom. Restoring the image
and reputation of our brands and services may be costly and not always possible, and re-branding in response
to such events may also be costly and negatively impact our business and prospects. Additionally, two of our
brands, T-Mobile and Tele2, are international brands which we license from Deutsche Telekom AG and Tele2
Sverige AB, respectively. See “Business—Material Contracts.” It is possible that an event that undermines the
image and reputation of these foreign brand owners or of foreign licensees of these brands, could have
reciprocal, secondary negative effects on our own image and reputation.

Reputational value is also based on perceptions, and broad access to social media makes it easy for
anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us, our brands, our services and our retail
stores, and it may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is
accurate. While reputations may take decades to build, negative incidents can quickly erode trust and
confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental
investigations, proceedings or penalties, or litigation. Negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects
on our business, including lost sales, boycotts, loss of development opportunities, adverse government attention,
or associate retention and recruiting difficulties. Any material decline in the reputation or perceived quality of
our brands or corporate image could affect our market share, reputation, business, financial condition, or results
of operations. See “—Our reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result of, and we could be
_held liable, including criminally liable, for, data loss, data theft, unauthorized access or successful hacking.”_


-----

**_Our reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result of, and we could be held liable, including_**
**_criminally liable, for, data loss, data theft, unauthorized access or successful hacking._**

Our operations depend on the secure and reliable performance of our information technology systems
as the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information relating to our customers and
employees. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems
change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target. In addition, the hardware,
software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture
or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. We may be unable to anticipate
these techniques or detect these defects, or to implement effective and efficient countermeasures in a timely
manner.

We operate in an environment increasingly prone to cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity threats may
include gaining unauthorized access to our systems or inserting computer viruses or malicious software in our
systems to misappropriate consumer data and other sensitive information, corrupt our data or disrupt our
operations or otherwise use our systems and devices to carry out any other illegal activities. Unauthorized access
may also be gained through traditional means such as the theft of laptop computers, data devices and mobile
phones and intelligence gathering by employees with access. Further, our employees or other persons may have
unauthorized or authorized access to our systems or take actions that affect our networks in an inconsistent
manner with our policies or otherwise adversely affect our ability to adequately process internal information.
As a result, we need to continue to advance our capacity to identify and detect technical threats and
vulnerabilities and improve our ability to react to incidents. This includes the need to strengthen security
controls in the supply chain as well as to place increased focus on security measures adopted by our key partners
and other third parties.

In order to prevent, detect or react in a timely and efficient manner to these or similar threats, several
levels of security are implemented, such as the deployment and maintenance of high-standard security
technologies, a 24x7 security operations center monitoring our networks and critical applications, critical
vulnerabilities remediation plan, awareness training for all employees and an incident response training. Despite
all these security measures, however, new and sophisticated malware is constantly being developed and it is
possible that systems are not updated on time.

If unauthorized third parties manage to gain access to any of our information technology systems, or
if such systems are brought down, unauthorized third parties may be able to misappropriate confidential
information, cause interruptions in our operations, access our services without paying, damage our computers
or otherwise damage our reputation and business.

An identity and access management project is taking place to make sure that no unauthorized party
gains access to our information technology systems. Intentional or unintentional (accidental employee) misuse
of authorized access can occur and we have there different countermeasures in place to stop or minimize the
exfiltration of confidential data, 24x7 monitoring, database encryption or privilege access management systems
and policies.

While we continue to invest in measures to protect our networks, as well as in procedures to allow us
to respond properly to potential security breaches, any such unauthorized access to our systems could result in
a loss of revenue or lead to consequences under our agreements with content providers, either of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In such
circumstances, we could be held liable or be subject to litigation, penalties (including the payment of damages
and interest) or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial
condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_We are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to the protection of personal data and data security._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and process personal data. In the EU, we are subject
to stringent regulations relating to the processing, transfer and storage of the personal data of natural persons,
including, in particular, the GDPR and, in The Netherlands, the AVG (Algemene Verordening
_Gegevensbescherming), which deals with the domestic implications of GDPR in The Netherlands. The GDPR_


-----

has been directly applicable in all Member States since May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC and current
national data protection legislation in Member States, and was implemented in the EEA countries with effect
from the same date. The GDPR significantly changes the EU/EEA data protection landscape, including
strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter
sanctions with substantial administrative fines up to 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding
financial year. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their
behalf, including with respect to the collection of potential damages.

The European Commission has proposed the enhanced e-Privacy Regulation, which would entail
additional and stricter rules than those established under the GDPR in respect of the use of personal data from
electronic communications. The e-Privacy Regulation would establish fines similar to those included in GDPR.
These regulations may affect the development of innovative services that would draw on consumer data,
potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for undertakings subject to both the GDPR and the e-Privacy
Regulation.

Regardless of the measures we adopt to protect the confidentiality and security of data, the risk of
possible attacks or breaches of data processing systems remains, which could harm our reputation and give rise
to penalties, fines and damages. In addition, we could be compelled to incur additional costs in order to protect
against these risks or to mitigate the consequences thereof, and as an electronic communications services
provider, we may be held liable for the loss, release or inappropriate modification or storage conditions of
customer or other data which are carried by our network or stored on our infrastructure. The occurrence of any
of these adverse events could in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and
results of operations. Furthermore, any loss of confidence on the part of our customers as a result of such events
could lead to a significant decline in sales and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations.

**_Our business may be negatively impacted by restrictions on customer access to mobile phone financing._**

We base part of our strategy for attracting and retaining customers on mobile phone financing that we
offer to our customers. Should consumers’ access to mobile phone financing be more limited, or become more
costly, in the future – for example as a result of adverse financial market conditions in the event of a recession
or the COVID-19 pandemic causing lenders to tighten lending standards for consumer financing – consumers
may be unable or unwilling to finance the purchase of handsets and other hardware from us and so may delay
or alter their purchase of our products or services, negatively impacting our sales, growth capacity and the
generation of cash to cover our financial obligations. See “—The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our
_business is uncertain and its effect on the Dutch economy and our customers’ behavior constitutes a threat to_
_our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.”_

In addition, as a result of the recent economic slowdown in The Netherlands and the general tightening
of global financial market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be restricted in our ability
to finance consumer purchases at attractive rates of interest, or at all, and may be exposed to costs related to
increased rates of default under existing consumer financing arrangements.

Further, the regulatory environment regarding consumer finance may change and may limit our ability
to provide certain kinds of financing to consumers or may make such financing more costly in the future. As an
example, in February 2021, the Dutch Minister of Finance sent a letter to Parliament reflecting an intention to
revise consumer credit regulation by lowering the threshold document verification required to obtain a loan for
a mobile device. Although we do not expect that this potential revision to Dutch consumer finance law would
negatively affect our ability to offer attractive consumer financing as such, we cannot predict the nature or
direction of future regulation. Future changes in Dutch consumer finance regulation could negatively impact
our revenue, costs, growth capacity and the generation of cash to cover our financial obligations. See also “—
_We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision, which could require us to make additional_
_expenditures or limit our revenue and otherwise adversely affect our business, and further regulatory changes_
_could also adversely affect our business.”_


-----

**_We may be held liable for the content hosted on our infrastructure._**

Our networks carry and store large volumes of confidential, personal and business data, through both
voice and data traffic. We process increasing quantities and types of customer data in both business and
residential segments. Despite our best efforts to prevent it, we may be found liable for any loss, transfer, or
inappropriate modification of the customer data or general public data stored on our servers or transmitted
through our networks or for any illegal or unlawful use of the internet, any of which could involve many people
and have an impact on our reputation, or lead to legal claims and liabilities that are difficult to measure in
advance.

Accordingly, in our capacity as an internet and mobile service provider and host, we could be held
liable for claims resulting from the content hosted on our infrastructure (specifically in connection with
infringements by the press, invasion of privacy and breach of copyright) and thus face significant defense costs,
even if liability for such claims was not established. The existence of such claims could also harm our reputation,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability
to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_Our business is subject to risks of natural disasters, fire, power outages and other catastrophic events that_**
**_can be further intensified due to the developing threat of climate change._**

Our networks and operations may be subject to interruptions by natural disasters, including, but not
limited to fire, floods, windstorms, earthquakes and other natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts,
equipment and system failures, human errors and intentional wrongdoings, including breaches of our network
and information technology security, all of which are events beyond our control.

As we operate in certain regions in which existing infrastructure and telecommunications equipment
(such as cables and mobile towers) may not be able to withstand a major natural disaster and/or in which
emergency response time may be significant, prolonged recovery time could be required to resume operations.
Moreover, certain regions in which we operate are particularly exposed to the developing threat of climate
change and they may be affected by the environmental impact thereof, such as rising sea and air temperatures,
rising sea levels, or extreme weather conditions which, in turn, could have an effect on the habitability of such
territories and the cost and feasibility of providing telecommunications services. The effects of environmental
disruption or other catastrophic events on our network infrastructure and equipment and on the economies of
the regions in which we operate may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes. See also “—The
_continuity of our services strongly depends on the proper functioning of our IT and network infrastructure and_
_any failure of this infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business.”_

**_The loss of certain key executives and other personnel, failure to apply the necessary managerial and_**
**_operational resources to our growing business or failure to sustain a good working relationship with_**
**_employee representatives, including workers’ unions, could harm our business._**

We depend on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key personnel. There
can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in
attracting, hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays.

Competition for qualified managers and personnel in our industry is intense and there is limited
availability of persons with the requisite knowledge of the telecommunications industry and relevant experience
in The Netherlands and other countries where we may operate in the future. This competition for labor has
intensified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and job vacancies in The Netherlands have risen in parallel
with the pandemic. See “—The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is uncertain and its effect
_on the Dutch economy and our customers’ behavior constitutes a threat to our business, operating results,_
_financial condition and prospects.” As a result, the loss of the support of key executives and employees could_
cause disruptions in our business operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.


-----

The operating complexity of our business and the responsibilities of management have increased
significantly as a result of the growth of our business through acquisitions and through our transition to offering
fixed internet services in addition to mobile services, which may place significant strain on our managerial and
operational resources. We may be unable to allocate sufficient managerial and operational resources to meet
our needs as our business grows, and our current operational and financial systems and managerial controls and
procedures may become inadequate. Any weaknesses in our operational and financial systems or managerial
controls and procedures may impact our ability to produce reliable financial statements and may adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although we consider the operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures
that we currently have in place to be adequate for our business, we recognize that the effectiveness of these
systems, controls and procedures needs to be kept under regular review as our business grows and matures. We
will have to maintain close coordination among our logistical, technical, accounting, finance, marketing and
sales personnel. Management of growth will also require, among others, continued development of financial
and management controls, information technology systems, customer service and legal resources. We may be
unable to hire managers with the relevant expertise or the hiring process may require significant time and
resources, all of which could result in a disruption in our management, growth, operational and financial
systems, managerial controls and procedures and, accordingly, have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of
the Notes.

Although our company has no history of strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions, we
nevertheless remain exposed to the risk of such industrial actions. No collective labor agreement applies within
the Target Group, except for that of the electrotechnical retail trade (CAO voor de Elektrotechnische
_Detailhandel), which applies to our retail shop employees. As of December 31, 2020, there were 497 employees,_
totaling 384.2 full-time equivalents, covered by this agreement. Additionally, a Joint Works Council has been
established at the level of TMNL which oversees company-wide employment matters and represents all
employees within TMNL. Moreover, there can be no assurance that some of our employees will not form or
join unions in the future. An increase in the number of our unionized employees could lead to an increased
likelihood of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions. In addition, we face the risk of strikes called
by employees of our key suppliers of materials or services as well as our installation providers, which could
result in interruptions in the performance of our services. We cannot predict the extent to which future labor
disputes or disturbance could disrupt our operations, cause reputational or financial harm or make it more
difficult to operate our business, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_We depend on third parties to market, sell and provide a portion of our mobile and fixed line products and_**
**_services. If we fail to maintain or further develop our distribution and customer care channels, our ability to_**
**_sustain and further grow our subscriber base could be materially adversely affected._**

Our sales channels vary across our brands. For instance, our broad network of T-Mobile-branded retail
stores is an important sales channel for our T-Mobile brand whereas sales under the Simpel brand occur
exclusively online. Sales under the T-Mobile, Tele2 and Ben brands also occur in significant part through online
and telesales, as well as through IDS channels. Through these IDS channels, mobile products and services are
sold primarily through third-party distributors including public retail outlets most of which also distribute or
sell products of our competitors. Altogether in 2020, 23% of our B2C mobile transactions and 11% of our fixed
gross sales occurred through IDS partners, whether through retail (8%) or through e-sales (15%). The
distributors, retailers and sales agencies that we rely upon are not under our control and may stop distributing
or selling our products at any time, for example as a result of financial difficulties including due to the COVID19 pandemic, or otherwise. Should this occur with particularly important distributors, retailers or agencies, we
may face difficulty in finding new distributors, retailers or sales agencies that can generate the same level of
revenue. In addition, distributors, retailers and sales agencies that also distribute or sell competing products and
services may more actively promote the products and services of our competitors than our products and services.

In addition, some of our call centers are outsourced to third parties that serve our subscribers and there
can be no assurance that such third parties will always provide our customers with the care that we would
provide them with. Further, if these contracts were terminated, we would have to find replacement services


-----

elsewhere, and the quality of such replacements could diminish the quality of our services to our customers.
See also “—We depend on certain key partners and other third parties for the provision of hardware, software
_and other providers of outsourced services, who may discontinue their services or products, seek to charge us_
_prices that are not competitive or choose not to renew contracts with us.”_

We intend to opportunistically and continuously develop our distribution channels in line with
anticipated market dynamics, which may require significant capital expenditures. If we fail to maintain a
distribution strategy that meets customer behavior in the future, our ability to retain or further grow our market
share could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by actual or perceived health risks and other environmental_**
**_requirements relating to mobile telecommunications transmission equipment and devices, including the_**
**_location of antennas._**

Various reports have alleged that there may be health risks associated with the effects of
electromagnetic signals from antenna sites, mobile handsets and other mobile and wireless telecommunications
devices. We cannot assure you that further medical research and studies will not establish a link between
electromagnetic signals or radio frequency emissions and these health concerns. The actual or perceived risk of
mobile and wireless telecommunications devices, press reports about risks or consumer litigation relating to
such risks could adversely affect the size or growth rate of our subscriber base and result in decreased mobile
usage or increased litigation costs.

These health concerns may cause authorities in The Netherlands or in the European Union to impose
stricter regulations on the construction of base stations or other telecommunications network infrastructure. In
particular, public concern over actual or perceived health effects related to electromagnetic radiation may result
in increased costs related to our networks, which may hinder the completion or increase the cost of network
deployment, reduce the coverage of our network and hinder the commercial availability of new services. Current
initiatives from certain activists groups against 5G deployment and the construction of more antennas with
higher frequency emissions and the reaction of some politicians and authorities on a provincial or municipal
level may have a negative impact on our network and our customer base. If actual or perceived health risks
were to result in decreased mobile usage, increased consumer litigation or stricter regulation, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to land use and the protection of the
environment, including those governing the storage, management and disposal of hazardous materials and the
clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines, sanctions and
third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, such
laws and regulations, which could have a negative impact on our future operations and could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Claims of third parties that we infringe their intellectual property could harm our financial condition, and_**
**_defending intellectual property claims may be expensive and could divert valuable company resources._**

We operate in an industry characterized by frequent disputes over intellectual property. As the number
of convergent product offerings and overlapping product functions increase, the possibility of intellectual
property infringement claims against us may correspondingly increase. Any such claims or lawsuits, whether
with or without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, could cause us to cease offering our
licensing services and products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, or could require us to
develop non-infringing products or services, if feasible, which could divert the attention and resources of
technical and management personnel. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any litigation
related to infringement claims against us. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in a
requirement to pay significant damages, cease the development or sale of certain products and services that
incorporate the challenged intellectual property, obtain licenses from the holders of such intellectual property,
which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or otherwise redesign those products to avoid
infringing upon others’ intellectual property rights.


-----

Moreover, we consider certain of the registered trademarks and trade names we use, including TMobile, Ben and Simpel to be material to our business, the infringement of which could harm our reputation
and lead to decreased subscribers and revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Our Separation from Deutsche Telekom**

**_Our historical results may not be representative of our future results as a separate, stand-alone company._**

As a result of the Acquisition and our pending separation from Deutsche Telekom, our consolidated
financial statements and the other financial information for our predecessor periods included in this Offering
Memorandum do not necessarily reflect what our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would
have been had we operated as a separate, stand-alone company during those periods. Our consolidated financial
statements and the other historical financial information included in this Offering Memorandum do not
necessarily indicate what our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or costs and expenses will
be in the future. In particular, the financial statements for our predecessor periods do not reflect the costs to us
of borrowing funds as a separate entity. For more information on our results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows, see “Selected Historical Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and the_
accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Our ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we do not, quickly and cost-effectively, establish_**
**_our own financing, network and information technology and other support functions in order to operate as_**
**_a stand-alone company, and we cannot assure you that the transitional services Deutsche Telekom AG has_**
**_agreed to provide us will be sufficient for our needs._**

Prior to the separation from Deutsche Telekom that will occur as a result of the Acquisition, we did
not operate and will not have operated as a stand-alone company. Historically, as well as utilizing Deutsche
Telekom and/or its affiliates’ brands and its central financing, we have also relied on network and information
technology, procurement and other resources of Deutsche Telekom and/or its affiliates to operate our business.
For instance, we have relied on Deutsche Telekom and or/its affiliates to operate the mobile core of our IoT
network, to provide terminals testing services and to serve as a roaming broker, among other services. Upon
completion of the Acquisition and separation from Deutsche Telekom, we will need to create certain of our own
systems, contract with third parties to replace Deutsche Telekom’s systems, or continue using Deutsche
Telekom’s systems on commercial terms. Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, we will enter into an
agreement of an agreed form with Deutsche Telekom AG under which Deutsche Telekom AG will for a limited
time provide certain transitional services to us. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”
These services may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and, after our agreement with Deutsche Telekom AG
expires, we may not be able to replace these services at all or obtain these services at prices or on terms as
favorable as we currently have. Any failure or significant downtime in our own financial, administrative, or
network and information technology systems or in Deutsche Telekom AG’s financial, administrative, or
network and information technology systems during the transitional period could impact our results or prevent
us from paying our suppliers and employees, executing foreign currency transactions or performing other
administrative services on a timely basis, and could also impair our ability to meet these obligations or could
result in weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal controls. In addition, under the terms of the indentures
governing the Notes, we are obligated to provide certain quarterly and annual financial reports to the holders of
the Notes, which could create further consequences upon any such failure. Any of the foregoing could materially
harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We depend upon the T-Mobile and Tele2 brands, and the owners of these brands may not have the same_**
**_incentive to extend our licenses to them._**

We license the T-Mobile name under a brand licensing agreement with Deutsche Telekom AG that
renews annually. Upon completion of the Acquisition, we will license the T-Mobile brand from Deutsche
Telekom AG for an extendible five-year term. Similarly, we have an agreement under which we license the
Tele2 brand from Tele2 Sweden that will be renewed on different terms upon completion of the Acquisition.
Both of these brands are well-known in The Netherlands and have historically formed part of our business. Now


-----

that we have separated from these two companies, they may not have the same incentive to extend the terms of
license agreements to these brands as they approach their expiry dates, or to agree on terms as favorable to us
as they may have been in the past.

If in the future we fail to renew a material license that historically has formed part of our business or
any such arrangement is terminated, we could be required to invest significantly in rebranding and our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

**_The separation of certain information technology and network resources that Deutsche Telekom provided to_**
**_us may lead to customer dissatisfaction._**

Prior to our separation from Deutsche Telekom, we relied upon Deutsche Telekom and/or its affiliates
to provide certain information technology and network services, including inter alia elements of our mobile
core such as Voicemail and SMS. We may experience problems in connection with the ongoing transition of
these systems from Deutsche Telekom and/or its affiliates to us or in arranging for these services to continue
on commercial terms after separation, which may lead to supply shortages and other disruptions for our
customers. If such disruptions occur and we are forced to compensate our customers or if our competitors are
able to take advantage of these disruptions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected.

**_We may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in the purchasing power that we may have had_**
**_during the period when we were owned by Deutsche Telekom._**

We have been able to take advantage of the Deutsche Telecom Group’s economies of scale and
purchasing power in purchasing technology and corporate services, particularly in relying on the Deutsche
Telekom Group’s strategic procurement agreements and group framework contracts, which may require
renegotiation of terms with third parties. Now that we are becoming a separate company, we will become a
smaller and less diversified company than Deutsche Telekom AG, and do not have access to financial and other
resources comparable to those of Deutsche Telekom AG and its affiliates prior to the separation. As a separate,
stand-alone company, we may be unable to obtain technology and corporate services at prices and on terms as
favorable as those available to us prior to the separation, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our separation agreement with Deutsche Telekom AG will require us to indemnify Deutsche Telekom AG_**
**_for certain future liabilities it may face with respect to our relationship with third-party service providers,_**
**_and it limits our rights to recover from Deutsche Telekom AG. These arrangements may be less favorable to_**
**_us than if they had been negotiated with a third party._**

Pursuant to the agreed form of the separation agreement we will enter into with Deutsche Telekom
AG in the context of the Acquisition, we will agree to indemnify Deutsche Telekom AG with respect to future
liabilities related to third-party service providers to the extent such liability would be caused by an act or
omission on our part that resulted in a breach of an agreement with the third-party service provider. The scope
of the liabilities we have assumed and for which we have agreed to indemnify Deutsche Telekom AG and the
terms on which we will do so may be less favorable than if we entered into a similar agreement with a third
party.

Additionally, pursuant to the agreed form of the separation agreement we will enter into with Deutsche
Telekom AG in the context of the Acquisition, we will have agreed to limit Deutsche Telekom AG’s liability
to us with for potential claims, including with respect to the nature of allowable claims, the amount of damages
that can be sought and the time period in which such claims may be brought. There can be no guarantee that
the terms on which we have agreed to limit Deutsche Telekom AG’s liability would be as favorable to us as
they might have been had we entered into a similar agreement with a third party. Moreover, even if we
ultimately succeed in recovering any amounts for which Deutsche Telekom AG remains liable to us, we may
be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.


-----

**Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters**

**_Our access to a competitor’s fixed network, on which we rely, has recently been deregulated. Such access_**
**_may in the future become more expensive to us or be terminated._**

We have executed a series of non-exclusive framework agreements with KPN and affiliated companies
that provide us access to their copper and fiber fixed internet networks. We are largely dependent on wholesale
access to these networks. For more information about these contracts and our dependence on them, see
“Business—Material Contracts—KPN Wholesale Agreements.”

As a result of a March 2020 judgment by the Dutch Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal (College van
_Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven) (“CBb”) annulling an ACM decision that had imposed obligations on KPN,_
KPN is no longer required, over and above the agreements we have executed with KPN, to provide us access
to its copper and fiber networks. As we can no longer rely on the former regulatory framework, KPN and its
affiliates could potentially discontinue access or charge prices for access without regulatory restriction.
Currently, we are largely protected against price increases by certain contracts we have concluded with KPN
for the wholesale access services we purchase from them and their affiliates, with the exception of the main
distribution frame (“MDF”) access agreements under which we have no such price protection. Once those
agreements expire, KPN could set higher prices for access to their network. In addition to the indefinite
framework agreements concluded for ODF and WBA wholesale access from KPN, we have agreed with KPN
a virtual unbundled local access (“VULA”) agreement for the Tele2 brand and an open wholesale model
(“OWM”) agreement, as amended, for the T-Mobile brand. The VULA and OWM agreements will expire in
2023 and 2024, respectively. In the case that the VULA and OWM agreements expire without our being able
to agree on new terms, we would need to rely on the indefinite WBA and ODF agreements which contain
significantly higher tariffs for effectively the same type of services purchased. Further, there is no regulatory
framework allowing us access to new technologies or enforcing price decreases to access them.

Additionally, KPN intends to phase out the access to its copper network and replace it with fiber
infrastructure, starting in 2021, and since Tele2 had obtained large-scale wholesale access to this network on
an unbundled (MDF) and bundled (WBA) basis, we would need to migrate those of our customers using this
access to an alternative infrastructure should the phase-out occur. The deregulation of wholesale access could
allow KPN to accelerate this phase-out, and according to KPN, this phase-out would occur over a three-year
period. On September 27, 2021, we initiated an interim injunction procedure to temporarily halt KPN’s planned
phase-out. On November 12, 2021, the court rendered its decision and denied our request for an interim
injunction.

The ACM is currently reviewing two requests, on independent legal grounds, that we have made on
the basis of which they could decide to restore fixed access regulation. A draft decision on our request based
on the Significant Market Power (“SMP”) regime is expected by early 2022. We intend to submit an additional
request to the ACM to take an emergency decision in this matter as a result of the November 12, 2021 denial
of an interim injunction to stop the copper access phase-out. However, there can be no guarantee that these
requests will succeed and that fixed access regulation will be re-imposed. If access regulation is not re-imposed,
we could face difficulties regarding (i) obtaining wholesale access based on higher bandwidth, (ii) relying on
WBA for wholesale access instead of on the basis of unbundled access in new areas or (iii) obtaining wholesale
access only on unfavorable conditions which would effectively make access economically infeasible, thereby
negatively impacting our ability to compete on the retail fixed market. If ACM were to grant the requests, the
decision could still be appealed ad it could be a lengthy process until restrictions are re-imposed. Moreover,
should fixed access regulation be re-imposed, this could occur on different, including worse, conditions as
compared to past regulation, or it could be imposed only on some and not all of the wholesale services we obtain
from KPN. Any of these effects could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Any failure to comply with license conditions may jeopardize our licenses, which are required to operate our_**
**_business and our networks._**

We hold a number of spectrum access licenses required to operate our mobile services in The
Netherlands. For a description of these licenses, see “Business—Licenses.” These licenses are subject to certain


-----

conditions, including the payment of costs related to supervision of compliance with license obligations, and
are also subject to periodic renewal and review procedures. In addition, our existing license in respect of
spectrum in the 700 MHz band contains certain coverage requirements. We must comply with these coverage
requirements by mid-2022, with a second layer of obligations that we will need to comply with in 2026. We
will take all measures to meet such coverage requirements in the future, however there can be no assurance that
we will be able to meet our coverage requirements in the 700 MHz band by the required dates or at all.

Any failure to meet license conditions may jeopardize our licenses. If we cannot meet license
conditions, there can be no assurance that the licenses will not be withdrawn.

**_We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision, which could require us to make_**
**_additional expenditures or limit our revenue and otherwise adversely affect our business, and further_**
**_regulatory changes could also adversely affect our business._**

Our activities as a fixed and mobile operator that provides customers with voice, text and internet
services are subject to regulation and supervision by various regulatory bodies, including local and national
authorities. Such regulation and supervision, as well as future changes in laws or regulations or in their
interpretation or enforcement that affect us, our competitors or our industry, strongly influence how we operate
our business. Complying with existing and future laws and regulations may increase our operating and
administrative expenses, restrict our ability or make it more difficult to implement price increases, affect our
ability to introduce new services, force us to change our marketing and other business practices, and/or
otherwise limit our revenue. In particular, our business could be materially and adversely affected by any
changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in their interpretation) regarding licensing requirements, access and
price regulation, interconnection arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change
in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators or increasing competition. There can be no
assurance that the provision of our services will not be subject to greater regulation in the future. Furthermore,
a failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations, including those imposing reporting obligations or
requiring registration and/or enrolment in lists held by competent authorities, could result in penalties, fines,
restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse consequences.

The regulations applicable to our businesses include, among others:

    - obligations to provide certain information to consumers in our contractual agreements with them
and through our websites, as well as to adhere to additional rules on the provision of consumer
credit during and after the ordering process;

    - price regulation for certain of the services we offer, including regulation on roaming fees,
international calling and cancellation charges;

    - rules promoting the elimination of surcharges for international roaming within the European
Union;

    - rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks, including call
termination, and the interconnection rates that can be charged by or to us;

    - “must-carry” requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carries certain
broadcast stations or obtains consent to carry a broadcast station;

    - rules for authorizations, licensing, acquisitions, renewals and transfers of licenses and franchises;

    - requirements to provide or contribute to the provision of certain universal services;

    - rules and regulations relating to net neutrality, subscriber privacy, end-user protection and data
protection;

    - rules and regulations governing network integrity and security, continuity and lawful interception;


-----

    - rules and regulations relating to our networks, including imposed universal access obligations, coinstallation and co-location obligations (including submarine cable landing stations), right of way
and ownership considerations;

    - rules governing the copyright royalties;

    - requirements on number portability; and

    - other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity,
emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, environmental standards, city
planning rules and customer service and consumer protection requirements.

Furthermore, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dutch government has prescribed detailed
guidelines to maintain social distancing and hygiene measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our
customer and employee premises. If additional or more stringent measures were to be imposed in the future,
will increase, the burden on management of such premises and could also lead to findings of material breaches
and related enforcement action for failures to comply with such requirements, which could adversely affect our
operating results and, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition and prospects.

Some of the regulations applicable to our operations within the EU often derive from EU directives.
The various directives require Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover such issues
as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and
any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our business in the relevant
jurisdictions is regulated and to which we would have to adapt.

In The Netherlands, the ACM is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Dutch
Telecommunications Act and the Dutch Competition Act. The AT is part of the Dutch Ministry of Economic
Affairs and Climate Policy and has enforcing powers in the fields of spectrum licenses, security and continuity
on behalf of the Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, as described in the Dutch
Telecommunications Act. The Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (“AFM”) (Autoriteit Financiële
_Markten) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Dutch Financial Supervision Act._
The Privacy Authority (“AP”) (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) is the data protection authority for The
Netherlands and the supervisory authority for the processing of personal data. The Dutch Media Authority
(Commissariaat voor de Media) has powers in relation to the Dutch Media Act. The Netherlands National Cyber
Security Center (Nationaal Cyber Security Centrum) is competent, on a standalone basis or alongside AT, on
cyber security incidents.

Any of the aforementioned regulatory risks could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of
the Notes.

**_The European Commission’s “Digital Single Market” legislation could adversely affect the Group’s_**
**_businesses._**

The EU Regulation 531/2012, which initially set a rate for roaming, was further amended through the
regulation 2015/2120 of 25/11/2015 to establish the conditions and the viability of a removal of retail roaming
charges from June 15, 2017 (“roam like at home” subject to fair-usage). Moreover, the regulation introduces
measures relating to “net neutrality.”

Furthermore, the roaming regulation was completed by other pieces of legislation:

    - Implementing Regulation EU 2016/2286 of 15/12/2016 laying down detailed rules on the
application of fair use policy and on the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the
abolition of retail roaming surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming
provider for the purposes of that assessment; and


-----

    - Regulation EU 2017/920 of 17/05/2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 with respect to
rules for wholesale roaming markets.

The European Commission’s proposals on telecommunications markets presented in September 2016
in-tends to fix rules to support the creation of Gigabit Society. The electronic communications code proposal
aims to make investment in very high capacity networks a binding objective and it also aims to promote
sustainable long term competition. It was adopted through Directive 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018
establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (the “EECC”), which entered into force on
December 20, 2018.

This legislation is expected to have both a positive and adverse effect on revenue generated from the
Group’s operations due to anticipated price decreases, higher operational costs and increased competition. All
of these factors may adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The
EECC brings together the rules on electronic communications net-works and services and aligns them with the
latest technological developments. The EECC regulates (i) electronic communications networks and services
(“ECN” and “ECS”), (ii) associated facilities and services, (iii) the authorization of networks and services, (iv)
radio spectrum use and numbering resources, (v) access to and interconnection of electronic communications
networks and associated facilities and (vi) the protection of end-users.

It aims to:

    - promote connectivity, access to and take-up of very high capacity networks by all citizens and
businesses of the EU;

    - promote competition in the provision of electronic communication networks and services;

    - contribute to the development of the internal market in the field of electronic communications
networks and services, radio spectrum, and connectivity; and

    - promote the interests of European citizens.

The EECC has singled out citizen connectivity as a key objective for the EU, since it is instrumental
in guaranteeing freedom of expression, pluralism, democracy, culture, social cohesion, and even safety. The
EECC also adopts a broader definition of ECS to regulate OTT services. ECS now includes internet access
services, interpersonal communications services (“ICS”), and services consisting wholly or mainly in the
conveyance of signals. The EECC also provides for strategic planning and coordination of a radio spectrum
policy, as well as for effective management of radio spectrum by Member States.

Finally, national regulatory authorities are responsible for ensuring access, interconnection, and the
interoperability of services. Consequently, and under certain circumstances, they can impose on undertakings
obligations such as interconnecting networks, ensuring the interoperability of their services and granting
physical access to their infrastructure. Member States were required to enact the EECC into their national laws
by December 21, 2020. In The Netherlands, the implementation of the EECC is still ongoing. Three EECC
elements were implemented with priority in 2020: symmetrical access regulation, reduction of barriers to
provider switching, and certain government investigatory powers.

**_We are subject to anti-trust regulations which may restrict our ability to make certain corporate acquisitions_**
**_or acquire certain assets._**

We are subject to antitrust rules and regulations, both general and telecommunications-specific, and
are, from time to time, subject to review by authorities that monitor market power in any of the markets in
which we operate. To the extent that we are deemed by relevant authorities to exhibit significant market power,
we can be subject to various regulatory obligations adversely affecting our results of operations and
profitability. Regulatory authorities may also require us to grant third parties access to our network, frequency
capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end-customers,
particularly if they were to find that we hold a position of market dominance. No assurance can be given that


-----

we will not be identified as having significant market power in any relevant markets in the future and that we
will not be subject to additional regulatory requirements.

**_We face risks arising from the outcome of various criminal, civil, administrative and regulatory proceedings._**

From time to time, we are party to litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or
investigations, including by governmental bodies, licensing authorities, customers, suppliers, competitors,
former employees, class action plaintiffs and others. From time to time, we may also become involved in
litigation matters pending against or related to entities that we acquire. Some of the proceedings against us may
involve claims for considerable amounts and may require that our general management devote time to address
the issues raised to the detriment of managing the business. In addition, such proceedings may result in
substantial damages or fines and/or may impair our reputation. For example, in September 2019, the ACM fined
several Dutch telecommunications companies for allegedly providing incorrect and unclear information to
consumers about their offers on their websites. In particular, both T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 received
penalties for not fulfilling information obligations on their websites in the period from October 2018 to March
2019. We are appealing a February 2021 decision by the District Court of Rotterdam relating to the amount of
these fines, with a hearing expected in the first half of 2022. As of that February 2021 court ruling, which
reduced the amount of the original fine by €1.3 million, we still face two fines in this matter in the total amount
of approximately €5.3 million. Any future such negative legal or regulatory outcomes could have a material
adverse effect on our business and reputation. We may also be exposed to proceedings with our independent
distributor partners, as well as other telecommunications operators.

Additionally, we are currently being investigated by the AT, in joint cooperation with the AP,
regarding alleged breaches of data protection and telecommunications laws in connection with our sharing
certain aggregated and anonymized customer location data with CBS under a partnership with CBS that has
since terminated. If it finds against us, the AT could impose a fine of up to €900,000. Although the AP is
coordinating with the AT in this matter and is unlikely to impose additional fines, the AP has the power to
impose fines in addition to fines imposed by the AT.

Prior to changing our debt collection processes and agencies in the first quarter of 2020, we sold
customer invoice receivables to Direct Pay who, as of September 30, 2021, continues to owe us €4.3 million
under our agreement with them, which we have currently provisioned as bad debt. However, Direct Pay has
submitted claims to us in the aggregate amount of €7.5 million, first, that we have not provided sufficient
documentation regarding customer contracts and invoices, and second, that it lost profits due to unforeseen
changes in the regulatory environment that diminished its ability to collect on the debts, and that we should
share the burden of such alleged lost profits. We discussed the matter with Direct Pay in the course of the third
quarter of 2021 but have been unable to resolve the dispute amicably thus far. We or Direct Pay may initiate
legal proceedings if we are not able to resolve this matter. Any such litigation may have material adverse effect
on our financial condition or results of operations.

Further, we have been involved in litigation involving our prior and discontinued offer of “free
handsets” to consumers along with mobile subscriptions, referred to as “all-in subscriptions.” In 2014 and 2016,
the Supreme Court of The Netherlands gave interlocutory decisions in which it concluded that such offerings
were not compliant with statutory provisions on installment purchases, credit transactions and credit
agreements. We had voluntarily stopped offering such all-in subscriptions on September 9, 2014 for direct sales
and January 18, 2015 for indirect sales. Tele2, which we subsequently acquired, also offered all-in subscriptions
and stopped offering them on September 1, 2014. Subsequently, multiple claims vehicles and foundations have
solicited individuals to initiate mass claims against telecommunications providers who offered all-in
subscriptions. We have been in contact with several vehicles and foundations in order to reach a settlement and
have reached a settlement with Consumentenbond and ConsumentenClaim in October 2020 in particular
regarding the period and type of mobile subscription eligible for compensation as well as the calculation method
for the amount of compensation per customer. We have finalized processing claims under this settlement.
However, this settlement does not cover claims submitted by other claims vehicles and foundations. For
instance, we are in settlement discussions with MobiClaim B.V. (“MobiClaim”) in particular regarding
potential claims on the same matter from claimants who are not party to any settlements thus far, and Stichting
Consument & Telecomsector (“Contel”) approached us in mid-2021 to express a willingness to pursue certain
claims that have been pending since 2016. Such negotiations may fail and it is possible that MobiClaim or


-----

ConTel will initiate legal proceedings. Although we expect our provision to be adequate for all potential claims
regarding this matter, and Deutsche Telekom and Tele2 Sweden severally have indemnified us with respect to
claims against us arising under this matter, subject to certain limitations and conditions, there can be no
guarantee that we can effectively enforce any such indemnities and any such action may have a material adverse
effect on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations. For additional information on this matter,
see “Business—Legal Proceedings.”

We regularly perform a risk assessment in respect of each open claim, litigation and proceeding and,
as of September 30, 2021, we had made a provision in our financial statements based on the estimated level of
risk and the expected outcome of the proceedings. However, we cannot assure you that the costs associated with
any of the proceedings we are involved in will not exceed the amounts reserved for them, and cash or non-cash
charges to earnings may result in the event that these matters are unfavorably resolved. The outcome of these
proceedings and claims could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_We are exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic_**
**_sanctions programs._**

We are required to comply with the anti-corruption laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where we
conduct our operations, and in certain circumstances, with laws and regulations having extraterritorial effect
such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. The anticorruption laws generally prohibit, among other conduct, providing anything of value to government officials
for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. As part of our
business, we may deal with entities, the employees of which are considered government officials.

Additionally, our operations may be subject to economic sanctions programs and other forms of trade
restrictions (“sanctions”) including those administered by the United Nations, the European Union and the
United States, covering the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Although we have
internal policies and procedures in place designed to ensure compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws
and sanctions regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be sufficient or that
our employees, directors, officers, partners, agents and service providers will not occasionally take actions in
violation of our policies and procedures (or otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws and
sanctions regulations) for which we may ultimately be held responsible. Violations of anti-corruption laws and
sanctions regulations could lead to financial penalties and to exclusion from government contracts and could
have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to apply all tax losses and/or tax credits reflected on our consolidated statement of_**
**_financial position._**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded aggregated tax assets of €417.4 million, of which
€49.5 million are in connection with certain tax losses incurred in previous years and €367.9 million in
connection with certain deferred tax assets largely relating to demergers of our business in 2007 and 2010 and
a re-evaluation as a result of our acquisition of Tele2 in 2019, all of which resulted in step-ups in our tax basis.
Such value has been determined in compliance with the applicable accounting rules. The registration is
supported by, among others, our estimates of future taxable income. Should our future results materially deviate
from such estimates, accounting rules will require us to register an impairment of such tax assets, which could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.

Our ability to apply the resulting tax losses and/or tax credits is conditional upon sufficient profit being
generated in the coming financial years. We may fail to achieve sufficient profit to realize the full value of the
tax assets reflected on our consolidated statement of financial position. No corporate tax impact in connection
with the impairment of any tax assets recognized in the historic period is expected to take place.

**_Changes in tax legislation and other circumstances that affect tax calculations could adversely affect us._**

We are subject to taxation and complex tax laws in The Netherlands as a result of the scope of our
operations and our corporate and financing structure. Changes in tax laws or regulations could adversely affect


-----

our tax position, including our effective tax rate, tax payments or increase the costs of our services to track and
collect such taxes, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments under the Notes and our other indebtedness.

In addition, new laws and regulations relating to taxes may be enacted imposing new taxes, or some
amendments may be introduced to the existing laws and regulations. As an example, the corporate income tax
rate, currently set at 25% will be increased to 25.8% from January 1, 2022. Further, the general interest
deduction limitation rule (the EBITDA rule), which currently limits interest deductibility up to 30% of
taxpayer’s (tax) EBITDA, will from January 1, 2022 be limited to 20% of the taxpayer’s (tax) EBITDA. These
potential changes to the existing tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax position.

In addition, we are also subject to taxes imposed by regional authorities.

The nature and timing of any amendments to tax laws and the impact on our future tax liabilities cannot
be predicted.

**_Tax disputes, tax audits and adverse decisions rendered by tax authorities may expose us to substantial tax_**
**_liabilities which could materially impact our business and reputation._**

Dutch tax authorities periodically examine our activities. We often rely on generally available
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations, including interpretations made by the relevant tax
authorities and courts of law. Although we believe that we have adequately assessed and accounted for our
potential tax liabilities, and that our tax estimates are reasonable, there cannot be certainty that the relevant tax
authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws, nor, as the case may be, that such tax
authorities or courts will not depart from their prior criteria.

The tax authorities may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax
treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. As a result of any future audit, inspection or
investigation, the relevant tax authorities could challenge the tax treatment of any of our transactions and
additional taxes could be identified, which could lead to a substantial increase in our tax obligations (including
any accrued interest and penalties), either as a result of the relevant tax payment being levied directly on us or
as a result of becoming liable for tax as secondary obligor due to a primary obligor’s failure to pay. If such tax
audits, inspection, investigations or challenges result in decisions that are unfavorable to us, we may be required
to pay settlement amounts, interest, fees or penalties, which may adversely impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations, and ultimately impact our ability to service or otherwise make payments
under the Notes and our other indebtedness.

**_We are a party to certain guarantees and may in the future become a party to certain performance bonds,_**
**_guarantees or other off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future effect on our financial_**
**_condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources._**

As of September 30, 2021, our off-balance sheet arrangements included €4.1 million of guarantees in
connection with the lease of premises. These arrangements are a result of certain of our contracts that require
that we post performance bonds or guarantees issued by banks or insurance companies in order to guarantee
certain legal and/or contractual obligations. There is no assurance that we will be able to provide these bonds
or guarantees in the amounts or durations required or for the benefit of the relevant counterparties. Our failure
to comply with these requests could reduce our capacity to conduct business or perform our contracts. In
addition, if we do provide these bonds or guarantees, the relevant counterparties may call upon them under
inopportune circumstances or circumstances that we believe to be improper, and we may not be able to challenge
such actions effectively in local courts.

We may also, from time to time and in the course of our business, provide other performance bonds
and guarantees and enter into derivative and other types of off-balance sheet transactions that could result in
income statement charges. Our reserves for these types of obligations and liabilities may be inadequate which
could cause us to take additional charges that could be material to our results of operations.


-----

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**

We maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our
business. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for insurance policies can increase
substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance policies may no longer be available, may be available
but not economically viable relative to the liability to be insured against or may be available only for reduced
amounts of coverage. While we maintain insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate against risks
commonly insured against in the industry, there can be no guarantee that all such risks are covered by insurance
or that we will be able to obtain the levels of cover desired by us on acceptable terms in the future. In addition,
even with such insurance in place, the risk remains that we may incur liabilities to customers and other third
parties which exceed the limits of the insurance cover or are not covered by it at all. In addition, our existing
insurance policies do not cover any losses arising from business interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
war, terrorism or other epidemic or pandemic risks. Should such a situation arise, it may have a material adverse
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Business—Insurance.”

**Risks Relating to the Acquisition**

**_The Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks and, if it is not consummated, on or prior to the_**
**_Longstop Date, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and_**
**_unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any._**

The completion of the Acquisition pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement is subject to certain
conditions and the receipt of certain approvals, including clearance from antitrust and other regulatory
authorities (the “Regulatory Approvals”). Even if we receive all clearances to consummate the Acquisition,
any such clearance may be subject to undertakings by us as may be imposed by the relevant authorities or
require the implementation of certain remedies. The Acquisition Agreement includes customary provisions
requiring us to comply with any remedies imposed by an authority and proceed with the Acquisition. In addition,
under the Acquisition Agreement, in the event that the Regulatory Approvals are not satisfied prior to the
longstop date of six months after the signing of the Acquisition Agreement (in case of the Existing
Shareholders), each of Deutsche Telekom and Tele2 Sweden (as Existing Shareholders and sellers under the
Acquisition Agreement) will have the right to terminate the Acquisition Agreement by notice to the other parties
at any time prior to completion.

Under the Acquisition Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable by WP/AP Telecom Holdings
IV B.V. as Purchaser at Completion Date consists of €3,713.5 million and, in addition, €700,000 per calendar
day from November 1, 2021 until the Completion Date, subject to certain limitations, to compensate the Existing
Shareholders for additional cash generation in the Group during this time period, adjusted for the amount of
Leakage, if any. As a result, the ultimate consideration under the Acquisition Agreement as of completion, will
in part be dependent on the timing of the Completion Date. See “Summary—The Transactions—The
_Acquisition.”_

Pending the completion of the Acquisition, concurrently with the closing of the Offering, the Issuers
will, on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Accounts. As of the date of
the Offering Memorandum, we do not yet know whether the Acquisition will be successful. If the Acquisition
is not completed or some of the other release conditions as described in “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Deposit_
_of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” as applicable, are not satisfied on or prior to the Longstop Date,_
the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption and you may not obtain the return you expect to
receive on the Notes. A special mandatory redemption will require the payment of a special mandatory
redemption price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the
Issue Date to the special mandatory redemption date, and any additional amounts. In the event of a special
mandatory redemption, WP/AP Telecom Holdings II B.V., the holding company of the Senior Notes Issuer,
will commit to fund the Issuers in such aggregate amounts as are required in order to enable the Issuers to pay
any funding shortfall, including Escrow Accounts fees, negative interest on the Escrow Accounts’ balance and
costs, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such
special mandatory redemption date pursuant to an equity commitment delivered to the Issuers by WP/AP
Telecom Holdings II B.V. (the “Equity Commitment”). The holders of the Notes will not have any direct right


-----

to enforce the Equity Commitment, and must rely on the Issuers’ sole right to enforcement under the Equity
Commitment. In the event that a special mandatory redemption of the Notes becomes necessary, and the
amounts needed to pay for it exceed the amounts available in the Escrow Accounts, the Issuer will be required
to fund, or procure the funding for, such excess amounts. There can be no assurance that the Issuers or such
affiliates will have sufficient funds to make these payments or to procure their funding and, as a result, the
Issuers may not have access to the funds necessary to allow them to pay the full amount of the required
redemption price in the event of a special mandatory redemption.

The Escrow Accounts proceeds will be deposited in separate escrow accounts that are controlled by
the Issuers. The Trustee will also have no responsibility or obligation to monitor the use and release of the
Escrow Accounts proceeds or ensure compliance with any restrictions or covenants, if any, related to its use
and release. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” and Description of the Senior Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

**_The Issuers do not currently control the Target Group and will not control the Target Group until the_**
**_Completion Date._**

The Target Group is currently not controlled by the Issuers. The Issuers will not obtain control of the
Target Group until the Completion Date. The information contained in this Offering Memorandum has been
derived from information provided to the Issuers by the Target Group, and the Issuers have relied on such
information supplied to them in its preparation. In addition, prior to the completion of the Acquisition, the
Target Group will not be subject to the covenants described in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and
“Description of the Senior Notes,” as applicable, which will be included in the Indentures. As such, we cannot
assure you that, prior to such date, the Target Group will not take an action that would otherwise have been
prohibited by the Indentures had those covenants been applicable.

**_Amendments to the Acquisition Agreement may have material adverse consequences for holders of the Notes._**

The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition
Agreement. As a condition for the release of the proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow Accounts, the Issuers
must determine that no material term or condition of the Acquisition Agreement has been amended or waived
in a manner or to an extent that would be materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes, other
than with the consent of a majority of the holders of the outstanding Notes. To the extent that the Acquisition
Agreement is amended or waived without the consent of the holders of the Notes in a manner or to an extent
that would be materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes, the proceeds of the Offering may
not be released from the Escrow Accounts and the Notes unless the Majority Lenders as defined in, and pursuant
to the Senior Facilities Agreement share include consent to any such amendment or waiver (or the Senior
Facilities are drawn any such consent being required, would be redeemed as described under “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” as applicable._

Holders of the Notes will decide to invest in the Notes at the time of purchase thereof and will not be
able to rescind their decision to invest in the Notes, including in the event of changes in the financial condition
of the Group, the terms of the Acquisition or the terms of the approvals or clearances (including regulatory
clearances) related to the Acquisition prior to the release of the gross proceeds of the Notes from the Escrow
Accounts upon completion of the Acquisition.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may not be able to enforce claims with respect to the representations and_**
**_warranties that the Existing Shareholders have provided to it under the Acquisition Agreement._**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Existing Shareholders have given certain customary
representations and warranties under the Acquisition Agreement, among others, in relation to the shares of the
Target and the business and operations of the Target Group. These representations and warranties are largely
covered under a warranty and indemnity insurance policy. However, there can be no assurance that the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer as the designated acquirer under the Acquisition Agreement, will be able to enforce any
claims against the Existing Shareholders relating to any breaches of such representations and warranties. The
liability of the Existing Shareholders with respect to breaches of their representations and warranties under the


-----

Acquisition Agreement is limited and the ability to claim against the insurer is subject to a retention and certain
exclusions. Moreover, even if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer ultimately succeeds in recovering any amounts
from the Existing Shareholders or their insurance providers, it may be required to temporarily bear these losses,
which could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the Group.

**_The Target may have liabilities that are not known to us or greater than anticipated._**

The Target may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing
due diligence investigations in connection with the Acquisition. We may learn of additional information about
the Target that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance
with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we could become liable for overdue payables of the Target
Group to suppliers and employees that are not currently known to us, or we could become subject to tax or
pension liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of which we
underestimated. In conducting our due diligence, we have been required to rely on resources available to us,
including public information and information provided by the Existing Shareholders and third-party advisers.
In addition, our due diligence provided for materiality thresholds, a limited scope and a restricted perimeter.
There can be no assurance that the due diligence we have undertaken has revealed or highlighted all relevant
facts necessary or helpful in evaluating the Acquisition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to the
adequacy or accuracy of information provided during the due diligence exercise. The due diligence process is
inherently subjective. If the due diligence investigation failed to identify material information regarding the
Target Group, we may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business
plan or incur impairment or other charges. Similarly, the materialization of certain risks, which may or may not
have been identified during due diligence, may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and, potentially,
subsequent contractual and statutory liability to various parties.

Any of these events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes.

**_We have made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition in forecasts that may prove to be materially_**
**_inaccurate._**

We have made certain assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings, synergies and
associated costs of the Acquisition. These assumptions are based on information made available by the Target
Group, which we believe to be reasonable. However, these assumptions and forecasts may prove to be
inaccurate, and we may suffer from, among others, a failure to realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition,
higher than expected transaction and integration costs, costs related to unknown liabilities, and a deterioration
of our business due to general economic and business conditions. Specifically, the Company’s objective to
realize cost savings described under “Summary—Our Strategies,” “Summary Financial Information and Other
_Financial Data—Other Financial Information” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum may differ_
materially from our actual results and investors should not place undue reliance on this objective. We have not
defined, and do not intend to define, “short-term” or “medium-term,” and these should not be read as indicating
that we are targeting such cost savings for any particular fiscal year. This cost-savings objective is based on a
number of assumptions which are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and other
risks, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, such assumptions may change or may not
materialize at all. In addition, unanticipated events may adversely affect our actual results in future periods
whether or not these assumptions otherwise prove to be correct. As a result, our actual cost savings, if any, may
vary materially from this objective. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations following the completion of the Acquisition and could cause our actual results to differ
from the assumptions and forecasts set forth in this Offering Memorandum.

**_The Acquisition may entitle certain third parties to terminate their agreements with the Target Group as a_**
**_result of change of control provisions, and may also impact our work quality and retention._**

The Acquisition may constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Target
Group, such as commercial agreements with some of its suppliers, and may entitle these third parties to
terminate their agreements with us or, in some cases, request adjustments and financing arrangements of the
terms of the agreements. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of these third parties may exercise their


-----

termination, adjustment or other rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial position following the Acquisition. In addition, some of the third parties may use their
termination or adjustment rights to renegotiate the terms of the agreements to our detriment and may benefit
from stronger bargaining power, as a result of which the Target Group may only be able to secure replacement
contracts on less favorable terms or at all.

Furthermore, the Acquisition itself has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time
and focus from management, which could adversely affect management’s ability to operate the business.
Likewise, employees may be uncomfortable with the Acquisition or feel otherwise affected by it, which could
have an impact on work quality and retention.

**_The interests of our shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the Notes._**

Following the Acquisition, the Sponsors will indirectly control the Target Group. See “Principal
_Shareholders” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” The Sponsors have, directly or_
indirectly, the power to affect, among others, our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as
well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our operations. In
addition, the Sponsors control decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent
any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether our management believes that
any such transactions are in our own best interests. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to
incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the
Indentures, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of
additional or more expensive indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of certain
assets could reduce our ability to generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect us. In addition, for
compliance with certain restrictive covenants, we will depend upon the cooperation of our principal
shareholders, who have the power to effect compliance with such covenants. The interests of the Sponsors and
their affiliates could conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The Sponsors may also have an interest in pursuing
divestitures, financings or other transactions that in their judgment could enhance their equity investments,
although such transactions might involve risks to holders of the Notes. In addition, the Sponsors or their
affiliates may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours or do business with us. The
Sponsors may also pursue through different portfolio companies acquisition opportunities that may be
complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So
long as investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors collectively continue to own a
significant amount of our capital stock, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively
control our decisions.

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information**

**_The Issuers are holding companies that do not have any revenue generating operations of their own and_**
**_depend on cash from operating companies to be able to make payments on the Notes._**

The Issuers are holding companies that were incorporated to facilitate the Transactions, including
#### raising financial debt and investing the proceeds from such debt to finance a portion of the amounts required to complete the Transactions. The Issuers have no have material business operations or own assets other than, following the Completion Date, the ownership interest it holds in the Target and with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer its rights and claims under the Proceeds Loan Agreements. The Senior Notes Issuer will be dependent upon payments under the Senior Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement and cash flow from our operating companies to meet its obligations under the Senior Notes. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be dependent upon cash flow for the Target’s operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. We intend to provide funds to the Issuers in order for the Issuers to meet their obligations under the Notes principally through payments made pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreements, the provisions of intercompany loans, dividends and other distributions. If entities within our Group do not fulfill their obligations under any such intercompany loans and do not otherwise distribute cash in order for the Issuers (as applicable) to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuers will not have any other source of funds that would allow them to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The


-----

#### amount of cash available to the Issuers will depend on the profitability and cash flows of the Target Group’s operating companies and the ability of those companies to transfer funds under applicable law. Our operating companies, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance loans, directly or indirectly, to the Issuers in order for the Issuers to make payments in respect of the Notes. In addition, the entities of the Target Group that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of the Target’s subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. The inability to transfer cash among entities within the consolidated Group may mean that even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet the obligations under the Notes, they may not be permitted to make the necessary dividends or distributions from one entity in the Restricted Group to another entity in the Restricted Group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations. Despite the covenants in the Indentures, and the Senior Facilities Agreement limiting the ability of the Parent’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law. 

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

#### At the Issue Date, the Initial Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and the Initial Senior Notes Guarantor will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes, respectively. Assuming the Completion Date occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any case no later than 150 days after the Completion Date, the Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and the Additional Senior Notes Guarantors will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes, respectively. However, not all members of the Group will guarantee the Notes, and, under various circumstances, the Guarantees may be released and newly incorporated direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent may not be required to guarantee the Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.” 

Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts due
#### under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under our finance facilities and bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. As of September 30, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the subsidiaries that are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have had no third party financial debt outstanding. 

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
#### reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: 

    - the creditors of the Issuers (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

    - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any
Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from
such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
#### (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement will permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indentures or the Senior Facilities Agreement, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations, which may increase in the future, could materially_**
**_adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying_**
**_our obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

After completion of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. As of September 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would
have had total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €3,750 million, including €1,350
million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, €2,400 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Facilities and excluding €500 million available for drawing under the RCF1, €200 million available for drawing
under the RCF2 and €17.7 million in relation to non-recourse factoring facilities. We anticipate that we will
continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.”_

Furthermore, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. If new debt is added to our existing
debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. Increases in our total indebtedness could also
lead to a downgrade of the ratings assigned to the Group or the Notes, which could negatively affect their trading
price. Our current or future leverage could prevent us from generating sufficient cash to pay the principal,
interest or any other amounts that become due and payable under our indebtedness, including the Notes. The
terms of the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement will permit the incurrence of substantial additional
indebtedness by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, including the Group’s operating companies and
the proceeds from such indebtedness may be used, among others, to finance shareholder dividends or other
distributions to shareholders reducing our liquidity while increasing our leverage.

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations including,
but not limited to:

    - result in our inability to maintain one or more of the financial ratios under our debt agreements,
which could trigger the early maturity of part or all our debt;

    - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with lower leverage and better
access to third-party financing sources;

    - increase the costs of current and future loans;

    - limit our capacity to access new debt and promote necessary investment, or our ability to withstand
adverse market conditions, including an economic downturn due to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic; or

    - force us to increase our capital stock or to divest specific strategic assets to service our debts or
comply with the commitments under such debts.

Most of the principal amount of our financial debt falls due in 2028, as upon the maturity of the TLB
and the repayment of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and there can be no assurance that we
will at such time be able to refinance or otherwise repay such principal amount in full. Similarly, the Senior
Notes will mature in 2029, which is one year after the maturity of the Senior Secured Notes and the TLB, and
therefore holders of the Senior Notes are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to raise the financing that
we require to refinance the Senior Secured Notes and/or the TLB, which mature prior to the Senior Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain covenants which impose operating and
financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among others:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

    - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase its capital stock;


-----

    - make certain restricted payments;

    - make certain investments;

    - create or permit to exist certain liens;

    - impose restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to
the Company;

    - merge or consolidate with other entities, or make certain asset sales;

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

    - guarantee certain indebtedness.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications which could allow
us to among other things, make significant distributions to our shareholders, incur substantial amounts of debt,
make significant investments and make asset sales. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject_
under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement could limit our ability to operate our business, to
finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be
in our interest.

In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants
while the TLB and the RCF remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Senior Facilities
Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain
outstanding under the RCF. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities
_Agreement—Financial covenant.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the RCF may be affected by_
events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of
the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Facilities Agreement could, subject to the applicable cure period,
result in an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default
that is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the relevant creditors are entitled to cancel the
availability of their commitments and/or elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, certain defaults, events
of default and/or acceleration actions under the Senior Facilities Agreement could lead to an event of default
and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions,
including the Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in
full those amounts, to satisfy all our other liabilities that would be due and payable and to make payments to
enable us to redeem the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed
against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks, and shifts in interest rates may adversely affect our debt service_**
**_obligations._**

We are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, particularly under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, as borrowings under the TLB and the RCF bear interest at a floating rate. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.” An increase in the interest rates on our debt_
will reduce the funds available to repay our debt and to finance our operations, capital expenditures and future
business opportunities. Historically, we have entered into various hedging instruments to manage exposure to
movements in interest rates, in particular interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, executed to partially hedge
our floating rate interest obligations. However, there can be no assurance that such financial hedging
instruments will be sufficient to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Additionally, there can
be no guarantee that any hedging strategies will adequately protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuation,
or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in
interest rates. In addition, derivatives transactions in connection with any hedging strategy may result in
significant costs and could expose us to significant liabilities in the future.


-----

As a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease to
be published as panel bank rates or become unrepresentative after June 30, 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings
for all currencies (including 1 week and 2 month U.S. dollar LIBOR) will cease as panel bank rates after
December 31, 2021). It is not known if or when regulatory reform may, in the future, cause EURIBOR to cease
or be replaced. The U.S. dollar floating rate market is currently expected to transition to use, in place of U.S.
dollar LIBOR, replacement rates including a floating rate equal to compounding overnight SOFR (the Secured
Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve in the US) plus a spread adjustment, as well as
alternative rates to compounding overnight SOFR, by not later than the time that the relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR
setting is to cease as a panel bank rate. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than
in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material
adverse effect on any of our debt linked to such a benchmark, whether or not under the Senior Facilities
Agreement.

Regulatory requirements under the EU Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to EURIBOR)
and under the UK Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to LIBOR) may: (i) discourage market
participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a regulated benchmark (such as EURIBOR or
LIBOR); (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used for the benchmark or (iii) lead to the
disappearance of the benchmark. The scheduled cessation of the LIBOR benchmark as a panel bank rate or any
proposal to cease the determination or publication of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of
administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes
to the manner in which the relevant benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms
and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the
above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for
reform or other initiatives may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any affected benchmark, which could
have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to that benchmark and
on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and therefore have a material adverse
impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes
and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_Hedging arrangements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging_**
**_counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**

We have entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate hedging arrangements to hedge our
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, including under the TLB. We may also enter currency hedging
arrangements in respect of our indebtedness. Under any such agreements, we would be exposed to credit risks
of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap
agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance
our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments,
which would result in a loss.

**_The preparation of our financial statements involves judgments, estimates and assumptions, and changes in_**
**_financial accounting standards may cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results_**
**_of operations._**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and
various other factors that are considered by our management to be reasonable under the circumstances and at
the time. These estimates and assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift
over time based on changes in our business mix and industry practice which could affect our reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

In addition, management’s judgments, estimates and assumptions and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses may be affected by changes in accounting policy. For example, major
accounting changes occurred during the periods under review as a result of our implementation of IFRS 16
(Leases), which has had a significant impact on our financial statements. We adopted IFRS 16 effective from


-----

January 1, 2019. As a result, leases (as lessee) that would have been classified in previous periods as operating
leases are recognized in our consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019. See note 2.4
to the 2019 Financial Statements. We have adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective method. On the
transition to IFRS 16, remaining payment obligations from existing operating leases were discounted using the
relevant incremental borrowing rate and recognized as a lease liability and the right-to-use assets were carried
as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease
payments.

As a result of the application of new accounting standards and the associated impact on our Historical
Consolidated Financial Statements, prospective investors should exercise particular caution when comparing
our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 to our financial
condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. See also
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’ For a discussion of the effects of the adoption of IFRS 16
on our financial condition and results of operations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Results of Operations—_
_Adoption of IFRS 16.”_

The entities that set accounting standards and other regulatory bodies periodically change the financial
accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These
changes can materially impact how management records and reports our financial condition and results of
operations. We may not be able to predict or assess the effects of these changes, and our implementation of new
accounting rules and interpretations or compliance with changes in existing accounting rules could adversely
affect our balance sheet or results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations
in future periods.

**_This Offering Memorandum includes certain non-IFRS financial measures calculated using management_**
**_estimates or projections and they should not be relied upon in isolation when making an investment decision._**

We present in this Offering Memorandum, Pro Forma Net Revenue, EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA AcL Margin, Underlying EBITDA AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL Margin, Pro Forma Operating
Free Cash Flow, Underlying Operating Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, Capital Expenditure, Underlying
Run-Rate EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL Margin, which give effect to the Tele2 and
Simpel acquisitions, the T-Infra demerger and certain adjustments for the estimated impact of IFRS 16, as if
these events had been consolidated in our financial statements as of the beginning of the relevant period. In
addition, Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL is derived using various assumptions, including assumptions
related to the full period impact of the expected run rate synergies for the relevant periods in connection with,
among other things, with the recent transactions as described above. We might be unable to achieve such costsaving synergies in the expected timeframe or at all and our actual results may differ materially, including as a
result of the assumptions underlying the expected synergies or related costs, proving inaccurate or different
from what we expected when calculating the synergies, also due to reasons which might be outside of our
control.

We include Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL in this Offering Memorandum
because we believe that it provides a useful indication of what these measures for the year ended December 31,
2020 or the nine months ended September 30, 2021 would have been under certain circumstances and
assumptions as described herein. Accordingly, Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Underlying EBITDA and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL do not represent
our actual results for any historical period nor should they be interpreted as an indication of our future
performance. We present Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL because we believe they provide
useful information to our management and investors with respect to our overall operating performance by
facilitating comparison of operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of items not
directly resulting from core operations. We present Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL because
we believe that they are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as


-----

supplemental measures of performance. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered indicative
of actual results that would have been achieved had the relevant events been consummated and the cost savings
been implemented in full on the date or for the periods indicated and do not purport to indicate our results of
operations as of any future date or for any future period. The assumptions we have made with respect to the
run-rate synergies that we present in this Offering Memorandum are based on our current estimates. These
amounts have not been audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. Pro Forma Net
Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL and
Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL do not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS or any
other accounting standards, and you should not consider Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Underlying EBITDA AcL or Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA
AcL as alternatives to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or any
other accounting standards or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. See also “Forward-Looking
_Statements.”_

This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or
complete picture of our results of operations for the periods presented and may not be comparable with our
consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum.
Such risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by Pro Forma Net Revenue, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, Underlying
EBITDA AcL and Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA AcL.

The foregoing financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation
S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. None of the adjustments,
estimates or run rate calculations have been audited by any independent auditors and should not be considered
indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the events for which we have made the
adjustment, estimate or calculation been completed as the dates stated and do not purport to indicate our future
consolidated results of operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those
presented for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used.

**_This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_**
**_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties._**

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, targets and assumptions in forecasts
that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our plans, strategies, objectives,
expectations, performance and leverage targets, estimates, projections and forecasts, budgets, goals, resources,
future projects, business expansion plans, changes in laws related to business operations, certain estimated cost
savings, government policies in different countries and other factors which anticipate future events. Actual
results may differ materially from the expectations and targets provided (whether express or implied) in any
forward-looking statement, although the Group deems that such information is based on reasonable
assumptions.

We reference targets and estimates in this Offering Memorandum based on our business plan,
calculations and/or public information previously disclosed to the market. The targets and estimates may not be
met due to several factors and circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control. Due to various risks
and uncertainties, including with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, actual events or results or the
actual performance, operations, financial condition, liquidity of the Group and the development of the industry
in which the Group operates may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward-looking
statements or projections. The estimates and targets contained herein are indicative only and should not be
construed as forecasts or an assurance that such targets will be met during the timeframe mentioned herein or
at all.

We have also made certain assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings, synergies and
associated costs of the Acquisition, including with respect to the calculation of Underlying Run-Rate EBITDA
AcL. These assumptions and forecasts may prove to be inaccurate, and we may suffer from, among others, a
failure to realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition, higher than expected transaction and integration costs,


-----

costs related to unknown liabilities, and a deterioration of our business due to general economic and business
conditions.

The opinions of the Group are current and do not constitute an assurance of future performance or
events of any kind. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described
in this Offering Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all. The Group is under no obligation to review,
update, supplement or provide any further information in respect of any estimate and/or forward-looking
statement because of new information, future events or other factors. Accordingly, prospective investors should
not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which the
statements were made. See “Forward-Looking Statements” for further information.

**Risks Relating to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral**

**Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes**

**_Certain of the Collateral will not secure the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date and/or Completion Date._**

The Senior Secured Notes will only be secured by the SSN Escrow Charge on the Issue Date. On or
about the Completion Date, and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and the
applicable perfection requirements, the Senior Secured Notes and the Initial Senior Secured Guarantees will
only be secured on a first priority basis by security interests in the Initial Collateral. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Completion Date and in any event within 150 days from the Completion Date and subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and the applicable perfection requirements, the
Notes and the Target Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by the remaining Target Collateral.
See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” Furthermore, on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured
Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will not be guaranteed by any of the Guarantors other than the
Senior Notes Issuer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and the applicable perfection
requirements, the Collateral will also secure borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain
hedging obligations, if any. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the
security over the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the
lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations, if any, have been repaid in full.
In addition, subject to and on terms consistent with the Agreed Security Principles, certain other security
interests in the Collateral may be confirmed, extended and/or granted (as applicable) in accordance with the


-----

covenants described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest.” In particular, with respect to the guarantees and/or security interests newly created and/or_
extended upon the effectiveness of the Post-Completion Mergers, a hardening period of one year applies.

The Collateral will be subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described
under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and Security.” See also
“—The Notes Guarantees and the Security will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”_

**_The Senior Secured Notes will not be initially secured by the Post-Closing Senior Secured Notes Collateral_**
**_and rights in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._**

The Senior Secured Notes will only be secured by the SSN Escrow Charge on the Issue Date. On the
Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured, subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements,
any Permitted Collateral Liens, certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws and the terms of the
Security Documents, by first-ranking security interests over, (i) a Dutch law share pledge over the shares in the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, (ii) a Dutch law bank account pledge over any material operating bank accounts
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and (iii) a Dutch law pledge over material structural loan receivables owed
to the Parent by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the “Initial Senior Secured Notes Collateral”), and as soon
as reasonably practicable, and in any case no later than 150 days after the Completion Date, the Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the
operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted Collateral Liens,
certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws and the terms of the Security Documents, (A) in the case
of Target Guarantors incorporated in The Netherlands, by first-ranking security interests granted by such Target
Guarantors over (1) any shares held by each Guarantor in another Guarantor; (2) any material operating bank
accounts held by such Guarantor and (3) any material structural intercompany loans made by a Guarantor to
another Guarantor, and (B) in the case of each other Target Guarantor, by first-ranking security interests granted
by such Target Guarantors over any shares held by each Guarantor in another Guarantor (the “Post-Closing
**Senior Secured Notes Collateral,” and together with the Initial Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the “Senior**
**Secured Notes Collateral”). See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.”**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims under the Senior Secured Notes, if we fail or are unable
to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. We may not be able to perfect any such security
interests. Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such
security interests may negatively impact the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Perfection of the
security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, especially the Post-Closing Senior Secured Notes
Collateral, after the Issue Date increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests become
avoided or subject to the liens of intervening creditors or intervening or existing liens. Any failure to perfect
any security interest in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may also result in the invalidity or the lack of
effectiveness of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of
the Senior Secured Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim
a security interest in the same collateral. The Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent will not be
under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such
liens.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not control decisions regarding the Senior Secured Notes Collateral_**
**_securing the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances._**

The Security Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, serves as a common security
agent for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes and the creditors under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities
_Agreement,” and certain other creditors under other credit facilities, hedge counterparties and other holders of_


-----

additional debt. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the
Security Documents as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
regulates the ability of the relevant Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security
Agent to take enforcement action. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Security Agent will act with respect
to the Collateral only at the direction of an “instructing group” (as defined under “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”). To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is_
secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes, the voting interest of the holders of Senior Secured
Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

Other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against
the Company or its subsidiaries during such period, the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek
protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or
reduced in value. In addition, any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will be
applied pro rata in repayment of the Senior Secured Notes and any other obligations secured by such Collateral
on a pari passu basis, which obligations are significant. As a result, holders of Senior Secured Notes will share
the proceeds of the enforcement sale of such Collateral on a pari passu basis with holders of other secured
indebtedness of the Group, such as the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes.”_

If the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our subsidiaries as a result of an
enforcement action or other distressed disposal in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under
the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—_
_Security—Release of Liens.”_

**Risks Relating to the Senior Notes**

**_The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured debt incurred by us._**

The Senior Notes will only be secured by the SN Escrow Charge on the Issue Date. The Senior Notes
will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis and secured on the Completion Date by the limited Collateral
comprising of (i) a Dutch law share pledge over the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and (ii) a Dutch
law pledge over any material structural loan receivables owed to the Parent by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.
As such, the Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our present and future secured indebtedness
to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement, as well as any second lien indebtedness pursuant to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any other indebtedness which may be secured by the Shared Collateral
on a senior basis. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that
secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Senior Notes will be available to pay obligations
on the Senior Notes only after the aforementioned secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. The
Senior Notes have limited security and there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any
or all of the Senior Notes then outstanding. The Senior Notes Indenture will not prohibit us from incurring
additional secured debt, nor will it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities. While
the Senior Notes will be senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Guarantees will be
general, senior subordinated obligations of the Senior Notes Guarantors and the Shared Collateral will rank
behind the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness, including any
second lien indebtedness that is secured by the Shared Collateral.

**_The right of the holders of Senior Notes to receive payment under the Senior Notes Guarantees is_**
**_contractually subordinated to the senior debt of the Senior Notes Guarantors._**

The obligations of the Senior Notes Guarantors under their respective Senior Notes Guarantees (as
applicable) will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all
existing and future obligations in respect of senior debt of each Senior Notes Guarantor, including their
guarantees under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement and, in the case of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, their obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Although the Senior Notes Indenture


-----

will contain restrictions on the ability of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors to incur
additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and rank senior to the Senior Notes Guarantees.
Any payments made by the Senior Notes Guarantors in respect of the Senior Notes Issuer shall only be made
after the senior guarantee obligations of such Senior Notes Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Facilities Agreement have been paid in full. In addition, certain future indebtedness, including but not
limited to certain hedging obligations, certain operating facilities and second lien indebtedness, will also be
entitled to recover the proceeds from enforcement under the Shared Collateral in priority to holders of the Senior
Notes. As a result, in the event of insolvency of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor, holders
of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in
respect of the Senior Notes Guarantees. In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement
relating to the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees provide:

    - customary turnover provisions by the Senior Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes
for the benefit of the holders of senior debt of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes
Guarantor, including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement;

    - that if a payment default on any senior debt of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor
has occurred and is continuing, the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor may not
make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes or the Senior Notes Guarantee until such default
is cured or waived;

    - that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness that
permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Senior Notes Trustee receives a notice
of such default, the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor may not make any
payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its Senior Notes Guarantee, until (amongst
others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date on which the
applicable payment blockage notice is received; and

    - that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Trustee are prohibited, without the prior
consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the majority super senior creditors, as
applicable, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain
circumstances.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the
Senior Notes Trustee will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the
Senior Notes Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture will restrict
the rights of holders of the Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against the
Senior Notes Issuer and each of the Senior Notes Guarantors, and by accepting any Senior Note, each such
holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior
Notes will have limited remedies and recourse under the guarantees in the event of a default by the Senior Notes
Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor.

**_Pursuant to the distribution waterfall provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Shared Collateral will_**
**_secure the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the obligations under the Senior_**
**_Facilities Agreement on a first priority basis, and will secure the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes_**
**_Guarantees on a junior priority basis and, as such, the rights of the holders of the Senior Notes to recover_**
**_on such Shared Collateral will be limited._**

The Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees will only benefit from security interests over a
limited portion of the Collateral, represented by the Shared Collateral. In light of the fact that the Shared
Collateral will secure the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees on a junior priority basis, pursuant to
the distribution waterfall provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, upon an enforcement of such Shared
Collateral, the proceeds thereof will be distributed to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the creditors
under the Senior Facilities Agreement and other senior secured creditors ahead of the holders of the Senior
Notes. Moreover, the Senior Notes Indenture will allow us to incur significant amounts of additional secured
debt that pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement may rank senior to the Senior Notes but junior to our


-----

obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement. If any such future secondranking debt is secured over the Shared Collateral, the holders of the Senior Notes would only receive the
proceeds from an enforcement thereof only after our obligations under, first, the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Facilities Agreement and, second, such second-ranking debt, have been satisfied in full. Consequently,
the holders of the Senior Notes may not be able to recover on the Shared Collateral because the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes, the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement and other potential secured creditors
will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of the Shared Collateral.

There is therefore no guarantee that the Senior Notes Issuer will be able to recover sufficient amounts,
or any amounts, from Finco under the Senior Proceeds Loan Notes for purposes of making payments under the
Senior Notes.

**_Upon issuance on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be unsecured and only guaranteed by the Senior_**
**_Secured Issuer on a subordinated basis._**

The Senior Notes will only be secured by the SN Escrow Charge on the Issue Date. On or around the
Completion Date, Senior Notes and the Notes Guarantees in relation to the Senior Notes will be secured, subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles, any limitations set out in the Security
Documents and the applicable perfection requirements by, the Collateral (as defined in “Description of the
_Senior Notes—Security”). Furthermore, on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will only be obligations of the_
Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and will not be guaranteed by the Target Guarantors.
Within 150 days from the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed by the Target Guarantors. There can
be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such security interests or Senior Notes
Guarantees within the time periods specified, the failure of which would result in an “event of default” under
the Senior Notes Indenture.

**_Rights in the Shared Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Shared Collateral._**

On the Completion Date, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the operation of the Agreed Security
Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted Collateral Liens, certain material limitations pursuant
to applicable laws and the terms of the Security Documents, the Senior Notes will be secured by the Shared
Collateral. Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Shared Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be perfected
with respect to the claims under the Senior Notes, if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect
any of these liens. We may not be able to perfect any such security interests. Any issues that we are unable to
resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the
value of the Shared Collateral. Perfection of the security interests in the Shared Collateral after the Completion
Date increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests become avoided or subject to the liens
of intervening creditors or intervening or existing liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Shared
Collateral may also result in the invalidity or the lack of effectiveness of the relevant security interest or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Senior Notes against third parties, including
a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. The Senior Notes
Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to
perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens. See Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on Notes Guarantees and Security—The Netherlands—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Security Interests.”_

**Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes**

**_The Senior Secured Notes will initially only be guaranteed by the Initial Senior Secured Notes Guarantors,_**
**_and the Senior Notes will initially only be guaranteed by the Initial Senior Notes Guarantors._**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will only be the obligations of the Senior Secured Issuer
and guaranteed by the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes will only be the obligations of the Senior Notes


-----

Issuer and guaranteed only by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Notes will only be secured by the respective Escrow Charges.

Assuming the Completion Date occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date, (i) as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Completion Date and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles
and the applicable perfection requirements, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Target Guarantors. There can
be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such Guarantees within the time periods
specified, the failure of which would result in an “event of default” under the relevant Indenture.

**_The incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured by the
Collateral may restart or reopen hardening periods (i.e., the periods of time following the granting of security
interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in
England and Wales and The Netherlands), as the Indentures permit the release and retaking of security granted
in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future
indebtedness. The applicable hardening periods for these new security interests can run from the moment each
new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or perfected
were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be
declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce such security interest. The same rights also
apply in connection with the accession of subsidiaries as additional Guarantors to the Notes and the granting of
security interests over their respective assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

**_The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted or will be granted_**
**_as security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations_**
**_under the Notes and the Guarantees._**

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the
Collateral. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—The Senior Secured Notes Collateral” and
“Description of the Senior Notes—Security—The Shared Collateral.” There is no guarantee that the value of
the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuers to satisfy their respective obligations under the Notes.
There is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds
of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to
satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes.

The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or
in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and
economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly
sale, the fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is
sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to
readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates.
Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to
buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral
should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid
and may have no readily ascertainable market value.

By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may
not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security
interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuers or the Guarantors, those
parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security
interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security
Agent, the Trustees or holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of
Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors (to the extent not repaid from the
proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuers’ and the
Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the
Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition,
there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, or at all.


-----

Proceeds from enforcement sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral must be applied to repay on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuers
and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured
Notes as well as borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedging obligations, if any, and any
other indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuers and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors permitted to
be incurred and secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture allows incurrence of certain
additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral on a priority or
_pari passu basis. The incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral would_
reduce amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

Proceeds from enforcement sales of the Senior Notes Issuer’s shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
must be applied to repay on a priority basis the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Guarantees as well as borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
certain hedging obligations, if any, and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred and secured by the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement, before being applied to repay the obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes
and the Senior Notes Guarantees. In addition, the Senior Notes Indenture allows incurrence of certain additional
permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Senior Notes Issuer’s shares in the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer on a priority or pari passu basis. The incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Shared Collateral
would reduce amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Shared Collateral.

To the extent that other first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and other rights encumber the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, or to the extent that other first-priority security interests,
pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture and other rights encumber the Shared
Collateral securing the Senior Notes, the parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to
the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to
realize or foreclose on the Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral is subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Indentures or the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such
exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore,
the security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of
perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition,
the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may
have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue
certain remedies in respect of the Collateral.

The security interests of the Security Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain
the consent of a third party, which may include regulatory authorities, to enforce a security interest. We cannot
assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the
consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets, including
due to any applicable regulatory constraints. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to
foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

In addition, the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, may have difficulty enforcing
or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition with third parties, including a trustee in
bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in, and/or priority with respect to, the same
Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and Security.”


-----

**_The Issuers and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could_**
**_reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents allow the Issuers and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral. Subject
to the Security Documents, so long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the
Issuers and the Guarantors may, among others, and subject to the terms of the Security Documents, without any
release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such
as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees are secured
on a first-ranking basis with security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that also secure our
obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the RCF, certain operating facilities, if any, and certain
hedging obligations, if any. The obligations under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees are secured
by the Shared Collateral. The Indentures also permit the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in
accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement,
and the Indentures regulate the ability of the Trustees or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent
to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to
do so by an instructing group (the “Instructing Group”) that consists of, prior to the discharge of such senior
indebtedness (the “Senior Discharge Date”), the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the thenoutstanding Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, creditors in respect of
indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of hedging obligations (the
“Senior Secured Creditors”), if any (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”), which aggregate more
than 66.67% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (in each case acting through their
respective creditor representatives), or on or after the Senior Discharge Date but before the discharge of certain
then-outstanding second lien indebtedness (if any) (the “Second Lien Discharge Date”), creditors in respect
of such second lien indebtedness (the “Second Lien Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than
66.67% of the total Second Lien Credit Participations at that time (but subject to certain restrictions on
enforcement by such creditors), or on or after the Senior Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date
but prior to the discharge of certain then-outstanding senior parent indebtedness (if any), creditors in respect of
such senior parent indebtedness (the “Senior Parent Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than
66.67% of the total Senior Parent Credit Participations at that time (but subject to certain restrictions on
enforcement by such creditors). The Instructing Group is entitled to give instructions to take enforcement action
prior to the end of the applicable consultation period without consulting with any creditor representative or
hedge counterparty if Collateral has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event that has occurred
with respect to any relevant Group company, or the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the
creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith that to enter into such consultation and
thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the Collateral would be reasonably expected to have a
material adverse on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce Collateral, or on the realization proceeds of any
enforcement of Collateral, and in such circumstances any instructions are required to be limited to those
necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of which the relevant
Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent is required to act in accordance with the instructions first
received. The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions that may in its
discretion require for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions until it
has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is
secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as the case may be, the voting
interest of holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as the case may be, in the Instructing Group
will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. The lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement or the creditors of other indebtedness that is pari passu with either the Senior Secured Notes or the
Senior Notes may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes or
the Senior Notes, as the case may be, and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect
to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the


-----

holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells the
Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under
the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may
be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.” Delays in enforcement could decrease or_
eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce,
or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security
Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the
Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the
Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuers and the Guarantors in the event of a default.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The security interests in the Collateral are granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local_**
**_law._**

The security interests in the Collateral are not granted directly to the holders of the Notes but are
granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that only
the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes
will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral, except through the Trustees, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indentures and the
Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

**_Each Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_**
**_subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor.
However, the Indentures provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor,
voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be
subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on Notes Guarantees and Security.” Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject_
to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these
jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit,
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial
assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a
Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other
obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. In addition, the laws,
regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have the
effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain
remedies in respect of the Guarantees.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and
other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee,
(ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or
to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically
if the court found that:

    - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over
another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain
jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference
or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant
Guarantee;


-----

    - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate
benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent
because of the relevant Guarantee, (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of
the relevant Guarantee or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness
beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

    - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in
the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries
pursuant to the Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
insolvent at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a
Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a
Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted
preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or improper corporate distribution on other grounds, or that a
court would not otherwise set aside such Guarantee.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in
such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution
on other grounds or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court
will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the
entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court were to decide that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance,
improper corporate distribution on other grounds and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any
other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor
solely of the relevant Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which
remains valid and enforceable. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part,
or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the
Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate
distribution on other grounds or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any
amounts outstanding under the Notes.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing_**
**_the Notes will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released automatically,_**
**_without your consent or the consent of the relevant Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including:

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes issued under the
Indentures or discharge or defeasance thereof;

    - upon release of a Guarantee (with respect to the liens securing such Guarantee granted by such
Guarantor);

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any
Person other than the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject
to “Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) if such sale or other disposition does not
violate the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) the Senior Secured Notes_
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement;


-----

- if the Parent designates any Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the relevant Indenture, the release of the property, assets and
Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary (as such terms are defined in “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions” or “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Definitions,” as applicable);_

- in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our secured
indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement, or otherwise in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement;

- as may be permitted by the covenant described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”;_

- with respect to assets held by or the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in connection with
a solvent liquidation of such Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to which substantially all of the assets
of such Restricted Subsidiary remain owned by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor;

- if on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and

- in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance
with the covenant described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation.”_

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically, including:

- in the case of a Guarantee by an Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or an Additional
Senior Notes Guarantor only, a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of capital stock of the relevant Guarantor or of a holding company thereof, such that such
Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all
the assets of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each
case in a transaction otherwise permitted by the Indentures;

- in the case of a Guarantee by an Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or an Additional
Senior Notes Guarantor only, the designation in accordance with the Indentures of the relevant
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Defeasance,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge,”_
“Description of the Senior Notes—Defeasance” and “Description of the Senior Notes—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

- in the case of a Guarantee by an Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or an Additional
Senior Notes Guarantor only (other than a Guarantee by an Additional Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor or an Additional Senior Notes Guarantor issued on the Issue Date), to the extent that
the relevant Guarantor becomes a Guarantor solely due to the operation of the first paragraph of
the covenant described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Additional Guarantees
_and Collateral” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Additional Senior Notes Guarantees,”_
upon the release of the relevant guarantee or discharge of indebtedness referred to in such
paragraph;

- in the case of any Guarantee given by any parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity, pursuant to the
provisions described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Event” and
“Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Event”;


-----

    - upon full payment of all obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Indentures and
the Notes; or

    - in connection with certain enforcement actions pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of Other Financial Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.”_

**_Dutch insolvency laws may provide you with less protection than bankruptcy laws of other jurisdictions you_**
**_are familiar with._**

The Issuers and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands. Accordingly,
insolvency proceedings with respect to such Issuers and the Guarantors would be likely to proceed under, and
be governed by, the laws of The Netherlands. Dutch insolvency laws are not identical to, and insolvency
outcomes may vary from, the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar.
In the event that any one or more of the Issuers or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings or whether Dutch insolvency
laws would be favorable to your interests.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any future guarantors, if any, were
to experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction’s or
jurisdictions’ insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.
Any Guarantees and Collateral provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this Offering
Memorandum are also subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any
enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other
jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other
jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or
in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void
preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and
duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question
whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights
under the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. See
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and Security.”

**_Upon an IPO Event, certain Notes Guarantees and Collateral may be released, any retaken Collateral may_**
**_be subject to hardening periods, and U.S. holders may have United States federal income tax consequences._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO pushdown (as described under “Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Pushdown” and “Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Pushdown,” as_
applicable). Upon consummation of the IPO pushdown, references to the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries
(and all related provisions) in the Indentures shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Event” and “Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Event,” as
applicable) and its restricted subsidiaries from time to time, although the relevant Issuer shall remain the same
entity. Upon such substitution, each Holding Company (as defined under “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes” and the “Description of the Senior Notes,” as applicable) of the IPO Pushdown Entity will be irrevocably_
and unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Notes Guarantees or security granted by such Holding Company in respect of the Indentures and the Notes will
be released. In such a case, new security documents in respect of Collateral to be retaken and that will remain
in place following an IPO pushdown may need to be executed and be subject to new hardening periods.

In addition, the IPO pushdown may result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for United States federal
income tax purposes, depending upon the specific circumstances of the IPO pushdown, and may have tax
consequences for U.S. holders, including recognition of gain or loss on such deemed exchange. See “Certain
_Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—IPO Event.”_


-----

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

The Indentures contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a Change of Control (as
defined under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior
_Notes—Change of Control,” as applicable). Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to_
offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur,
we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have
sufficient funds to provide to the Issuers to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the
restrictions in the Indentures, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Facilities Agreement or our other thenexisting contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may
result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Facilities Agreement. The exercise of the right of holders of
the Notes to require the repurchase of the Notes upon a change of control could cause a default under our debt
documents, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuers to receive cash from entities
of our Group to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of
control, may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when
we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuers for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek
the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuers
will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able
to obtain third-party financing to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition or make an offer to
repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. Any failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the Notes would
constitute a default under the Indentures, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities
Agreement. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior
_Notes—Change of Control.”_

Further, if pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes (as the case may be) validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indentures will permit the relevant Issuer, at its option, to redeem
the remaining outstanding Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes (as the case may be) at a price of 101% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may
be required to surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and
may not receive the return expected.

The change of control provisions contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other
similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve
a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control (as
defined under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior
_Notes—Change of Control,” as the case may be). Except as described under “Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control,” the Indentures do not_
contain provisions that would require the Issuers to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. Additionally, there are certain
exceptions to the definition of “Change of Control” which allow changes in the ownership of the relevant Issuer
if certain conditions are satisfied, including if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded
in connection with such Change of Control on one occasion.

In the event the Parent is sold to a new investor, whether or not such sale constitutes a change of control
under the Indentures, no assurance can be given that any such investor will continue to implement our current
business and financial strategy.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indentures include a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the


-----

Parent’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
change of control has occurred and whether the Issuers are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indentures will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indentures, the Notes receive
Investment Grade Status (as defined under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions” and
“Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Definitions,” as the case may be) and no default or event of default
has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day the following provisions of the Indentures will not apply
to the Notes: “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,”
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions
_from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on_
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—_
_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—_
_Additional Guarantees and Collateral” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant_
described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Parent,” and
“Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “Description of the Senior
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees and Collateral” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer and the
_Parent,” and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indentures._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency to such Notes should
subsequently decline to below “Baa3” or “BBB,” as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as
at and from the date of such rating decline. If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be able to incur
additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, without restrictions under the Notes
which may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will
ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable_**
**_security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with the provisions described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption” or “Description of the Senior Notes—
_Optional Redemption,” as applicable, and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor_
who receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a
comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_If certain changes to tax law were to occur, the relevant Issuer would have the option to redeem the Notes of_**
**_the applicable series._**

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes,” as the_
case may be) affecting taxation become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions on
the payments on the Notes of a series or the Guarantees of such Notes, the relevant Issuer may redeem the Notes
of such series in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. We are unable to determine whether
such developments affecting taxation will be enacted, but if such changes do occur, the Notes of a series will
be redeemable at the option of the relevant Issuer.


-----

**_Dutch withholding tax may be due on (deemed) payments of interest under the Notes._**

Dutch withholding tax (at a rate equal to the highest Dutch corporate income tax rate) may be due on
(actual or deemed) payments of interest (including guarantee payments) under the Notes due by (verschuldigd
_door) any Issuer, Guarantor or future issuer or guarantor incorporated or organized under the laws of the_
Netherlands or otherwise tax resident, or with a taxable presence, in the Netherlands (the “Dutch
**Issuers/Guarantors”) (the “(Deemed) Payments”) pursuant to The Netherlands Withholding Tax Act 2021**
(Wet bronbelasting 2021) in case the relevant Dutch Issuer/Guarantor is related (gelieerd) (within the meaning
set out below) to the entity entitled to such (Deemed) Payments (voordeelgerechtigde) and:

    - such related recipient entity (i) is (deemed) resident in a low tax jurisdiction (laagbelastende
_jurisdictie) or (ii) has a permanent establishment in such low tax jurisdiction to which the interest_
(or guarantee payment) is allocated (worden toegerekend);

    - the related recipient entity is not (deemed) resident in a low tax jurisdiction, in case (a) such entity
is entitled to the (Deemed) Payments with the main purpose or one of the main purposes of
avoiding withholding tax in the hands of another person or entity, and (b) there is an artificial
arrangement or transaction, or a series of artificial arrangements or transactions. An arrangement
or transaction, or series of arrangements or transactions, shall be regarded as artificial to the extent
that it is not put into place for valid commercial reasons, which reflect economic reality; and/or

    - the related entity is from a Dutch tax perspective regarded the recipient of the (Deemed)
Payments, whereas such related recipient entity is not regarded as the recipient (gerechtigde)
thereof pursuant to the laws of the country in which such entity is (deemed) resident or pursuant
to the laws of which such entity is established (opgericht).

No additional amounts shall be payable with respect to any Note in relation to the withholding or
deduction for or on account of any tax imposed or to be withheld in the Netherlands pursuant to The Netherlands
Withholding Tax Act 2021. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes” and
“Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

_Related entities_

Generally, a holder of notes is considered to be related to a Dutch Issuer/Guarantor for these purposes
if (i) it has a qualifying interest in a Dutch Issuer/Guarantor, (ii) a Dutch Issuer/Guarantor has a qualifying
interest in such party, or (iii) a third party has a qualifying interest in both a Dutch Issuer/Guarantor and such
party. For these purposes, a party is equated with any collaborating group of parties of which it forms part. A
qualifying interest is an interest that allows the holder to have a decisive influence over the other party’s
decisions, in such a way that it is able to determine the activities of the other party. A party is in any case
considered to have a qualifying interest in another party if it (directly or indirectly) owns more than 50% of the
voting rights in such other party.

_Low tax jurisdictions_

A jurisdiction qualifies as a low tax jurisdiction for purposes of The Netherlands Withholding Tax Act
2021 if it is listed in an annually updated ministerial decree published by the Dutch government which includes
jurisdictions (i) with a profit tax applying a statutory rate of less than 9% (updated annually based on an
assessment as of October 1 of the preceding year) or (ii) included on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions
in the preceding year.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit
ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining
the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential


-----

impact of all risks related to the structure, market or other risk factors discussed in this section of this Offering
Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors” and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating
is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal
by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will be assigned at all, or that
any credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream. Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered
form, or definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book entry interests only in very limited
circumstances. Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes unless and
until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its
nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form
will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such
payments will be credited to participants’ accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream that hold book-entry interests
in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Trustees, the Paying
Agent, any other paying agent or any registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, or to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes,
you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any
rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indentures.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents
or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including enforcement of security for the
Notes and the Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (as registered holder of the applicable Notes) to act on your
instructions and/or will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to
do so from Euroclear and Clearstream, or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any
requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although the Issuers will agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to have the Notes listed
on the Exchange and admitted to dealing on the Official List thereof and to maintain such listing as long as the
Notes are outstanding, the Issuers cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuers
cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it
becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuers may cease to make or maintain such
listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a
result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable
issuers in accordance with the Indentures, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from
the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indentures may have a
material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.


-----

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

    - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Notes; or

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices
of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by
a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in
prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which
the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such
disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no
active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed.
Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the permission to deal in the Notes
on the Official List of the Exchange being granted, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether
or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the
Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable,
in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indentures allow us to issue additional notes in the future, which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Additional Notes” and
“Description of the Senior Notes—Additional Notes.”

**_The interests of the holders of the Notes and additional notes issued under the Indentures from time to time_**
**_may be inconsistent._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the
Senior Notes will be issued pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture. Subject to certain restrictions, further series
of additional notes may be issued under the Indentures which may have different terms in respect of currency,
interest rate and certain other matters. Accordingly, holders of such additional notes may have interests that
differ from the holders of other series of notes issued under the Indentures, including the Notes. However,
holders of such additional notes will generally vote as a single class with holders of other series of notes issued
under the relevant Indenture, including the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes (as the case may be), with
respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications of the relevant Indenture. Accordingly, to the extent any
amendment, waiver or modification is approved by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes (as the case may be) then outstanding under the relevant Indenture
(subject to the limited exceptions), all holders of Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes (as the case may be)
under the relevant Indenture will be bound by such amendment, waiver or modification.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or
the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in
the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. See


-----

“Transfer Restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the
Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuers and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United
States, and the business of such entities organized outside the United States is conducted outside the United
States. The majority of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors organized outside
the United States are non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuers and the Guarantors will submit to
the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under
the Indentures, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on those directors and
executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors outside the United States. In addition, because the majority
of the assets of the Issuers and Guarantors and the assets of their directors and executive officers are located
outside of the United States, your ability to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts will be
limited. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuers and the
Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.
See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The Indentures will not be qualified under the TIA._**

The Indentures with respect to the Notes offered hereby are not required to be, nor will they be,
qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”) and will not incorporate or
include or be subject to any of the provisions of the TIA. Consequently, the holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified
indenture, including those respecting preferential collections by the Trustees or conflicting interests of the
Trustees. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.”

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. An investment in the Notes denominated in a
currency other than the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments will entail
foreign exchange related risks due to, among others, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative
to other relevant currencies because of economic, political or other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the euro against other relevant currencies could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated
into the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments. In addition, an investment
in the Notes by U.S. investors may have significant tax consequences. See “Certain Tax Considerations—
_Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_Additional Senior Secured Notes or Additional Senior Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be_**
**_fungible with existing Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, for United States federal income_**
**_tax purposes._**

Additional Senior Secured Notes or Additional Senior Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time
may be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the
applicable series of Notes previously issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes
Indenture, as applicable, without being fungible with such series of Notes for United States federal income tax
purposes. If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal
_Income Tax Considerations.”) considering the purchase of Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes sold pursuant_
to Regulation S as part of this offering of Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes or in the secondary market,
you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences
to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such series of Notes, including with respect to the potential
issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes or Additional Senior Notes that are not fungible with the applicable
series of initial Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture, as
applicable, for United States federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being
separately identified. In the event Additional Senior Secured Notes or Additional Senior Notes are issued
pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification


-----

number as Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, belonging to the same series previously issued,
without being fungible with such series of initial Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, for United
States federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the relevant Regulation S Global Notes (as defined
herein) that form part of that series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in such
Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Senior Secured Notes or
Additional Senior Notes, as applicable, will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a 144A Global
Note (as defined herein) (if any) representing Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, of that same
series. Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the relevant
Regulation S Global Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Transfers,” “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Additional Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Additional Notes.”_

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect to receive gross proceeds of €1,350.0 million from the offering of the Notes, assuming an
issuance at par. The proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under the TLB and the
Shareholder Contribution from the Sponsors, will be used to (a) make payments under the Acquisition
Agreement (including the acquisition consideration and funds for refinancing the Existing Target Group
Facilities) and (b) pay certain costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection the Transactions, including the
offering of the Notes.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of proceeds in connection with the
Acquisition and the other Transactions. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several
factors, including the exact Completion Date, actual amount of cash at the Target on Completion Date, any
Leakages as described under “Summary—The Transactions,” and the difference between the estimated and
actual fees and expenses.

**Sources of Funds** **Uses of Funds**

_(€ in millions)_

Notes offered hereby[(1)] ............................................... 1,350.0 Payments under the Acquisition Agreement[(4)] ..... 4,693.8

par.

(2) Represents the borrowing under the TLB provided for under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In connection with the Transactions,
the Parent has entered into the Senior Facilities Agreement, which provides for a TLB of €2,400 million and revolving facilities
consisting of the €500 million RCF1 and the €200 million RCF2. On or about the Completion Date, the TLB is expected to be drawn
in full, and along with the proceeds from the Notes and the Shareholder Contribution, utilized as set forth above. RCF1 and RCF2
are expected to remain undrawn as of the Completion Date. See also “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.”_

(3) Represents approximately €1,090.0 million in aggregate amount of estimated common equity directly or indirectly to be contributed
to the Parent in connection with the Acquisition by the Sponsors.

(4) Represents the sum of the following amounts:

     - €3,713.5 million, which is the amount payable to the sellers as consideration under the Acquisition Agreement. The
Acquisition consideration, which is payable on the Completion Date, is subject to adjustments in respect of any Leakage,
as further described under “Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition.” The amount also excludes any consideration
that is payable in respect of the Acquisition at a daily rate of €700,000 from November 1, 2021 until the Completion Date

**SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following tables set forth our selected financial information on a consolidated basis as of the dates
and for the periods indicated. The results of operations for prior fiscal years may not be necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for any future period. This selected financial information should be read in
conjunction with the Historical Consolidated Financial Statements (as defined below) and accompanying notes
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and discussed in “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information,” “Summary Financial Information and Other Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis_
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

**Financial Statements Presented**

**_Historical Financial Information of the Target Group_**

The consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position and
consolidated statement of cash flows of the Target Group presented herein are derived from (i) the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2020, including the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the European Union and which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.
(the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, including
the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting (the “Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Historical Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering
Memorandum is derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Financial Statements”). The audited consolidated financial statements of the
Target Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were originally approved by us on December 31,
2019. Thereafter, we have restated certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31,
2018, included in the 2019 Financial Statements, by restating the classification of “other receivables” to “trade
receivables” for an amount of €619 thousand, “other payables” to “current other liabilities” for an amount of
€68,947 thousand, “non-current other liabilities” to “other liabilities” for an amount of €2,004 thousand, “other
receivables” to “other assets” for an amount of €32,629 thousand and “tax liabilities” to “liabilities held for
sale” for an amount of €1,792 thousand. These restatements do not have any impact on the reported profit for
the year 2018 or reported equity and an immaterial impact on the cash flow statement for 2018. As a result, we
have not separately restated the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. See note
2.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements.

In addition, we also present certain financial information of the Target Group for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021 (the “LTM Financial Information”). Except as otherwise stated, the LTM
Financial Information is derived by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of profit
or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the
audited consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income of the Target Group for the
year ended December 31, 2020 and deducting the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of
profit or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
The LTM Financial Information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily
representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.
Except as stated otherwise, the LTM Financial Information is not prepared in the ordinary course of our
financial reporting or in accordance with IFRS.

We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) effective from January 1, 2019. As a result, leases (as lessee) that would
have been classified in previous periods as operating leases are recognized in our consolidated statement of
financial position as of December 31, 2019. Under the new standard, except for short-term or low-value leases,
the right to use a leased asset is recognized as an asset with a corresponding financial liability for the present
value of outstanding lease payments. Assets with a finite useful life are subject to impairment testing. We have
adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective method. On the transition to IFRS 16, remaining payment


-----

obligations from existing operating leases were discounted using the relevant incremental borrowing rate and
recognized as a lease liability and the right-to-use assets were carried as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of
the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments.

As a result of the application of new accounting standards and the associated impact on our Historical
Consolidated Financial Statements, prospective investors should exercise particular caution when comparing
our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 to our financial
condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The preparation of our financial_
_statements involves judgments, estimates and assumptions, and changes in financial accounting standards may_
_cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.” For a discussion of the_
effects of the adoption of IFRS 16 on our financial condition and results of operations, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability_
_of Our Results of Operations—Adoption of IFRS 16” and note 2.4 to the 2019 Financial Statements._

The selected historical consolidated financial information is qualified in its entirety by reference to,
and should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Information,” “Summary Financial
_Information and Other Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations” and the Historical Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere_
in this Offering Memorandum.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS**

**OF OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis provide information that we believe is relevant to an assessment_
_and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations for the periods under review and should_
_be read together with our Historical Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion contains forward-_
_looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ_
_materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements for many reasons. See “Forward-Looking_
_Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of important factors to be evaluated in connection with an_
_investment in the Notes._

_The following discussion and analysis presents the historical consolidated financial information of the_
_Target Group as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, 2020 and the nine months ended_
_September 30, 2020 and 2021._

_Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “IFRS” herein are to_
_International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union._

**Overview**

Operating under the T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel brands, we are one of the three mobile network
operators (“MNOs”) in the Dutch telecommunications market. We offer mobile (both postpaid and prepaid)
and fixed telecommunications services to both B2C and B2B customers, and we also sell handsets to our
customers. We are the largest mobile telecommunications provider in the Dutch consumer market by mobile
service revenue and number of SIMs, we have been ranked as the best mobile network in The Netherlands for
the fifth year in a row, and we have also been ranked as the top network in the world (Source: Umlaut, The
_2021 Mobile Network Test in The Netherlands; PresseBox, T-Mobile Awarded “Best in Test” Worldwide by_
_Umlaut)._

As of September 30, 2021, we had 6.9 million mobile subscribers and 0.7 million fixed subscribers,
representing an increase of approximately 29% and 24%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2018. For
the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions and other adjustments, our
combined mobile service revenues totaled €1,215.1 million, our combined fixed line services revenue totaled
€391 million, and our revenue from the sale of goods and services, and other revenues totaled €443 million.
Mobile service revenue combines mobile revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as visitor roaming,
and our fixed line services revenue combines fixed line revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as
fixed line wholesale revenue. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions
and other adjustments, our revenue for the B2C segment totaled €1,239 million and for the B2B segment was
€292 million. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was
€637.4 million.

**Basis of Presentation**

**_Our Historical Financial Information_**

The historical consolidated financial information presented in the following discussion and analysis is
that of the Target Group for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020, and the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 and 2021.

The consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position and
consolidated statement of cash flows of the Target Group presented below are derived from (i) the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2020, including the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the European Union, and which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.
(the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, including
the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial


-----

Reporting (the “Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Historical Consolidated Financial Statements”). See “Presentation
_of Financial and Other Information.”_

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union
and international accounting standards, as applicable, requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. The
areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant to our financial statements are disclosed in the Historical Consolidated Financial Statements, as
indicated below in “—Significant Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements used when Applying
_Accounting Principles.”_

The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering
Memorandum is derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Financial Statements”). The audited consolidated financial statements of the
Target Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were originally approved by us on December 31,
2019. Thereafter, we have restated certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31,
2018, included in the 2019 Financial Statements, by restating the classification of “other receivables” to “trade
receivables” for an amount of €619 thousand, “other payables” to “current other liabilities” for an amount of
€68,947 thousand, “non-current other liabilities” to “other liabilities” for an amount of €2,004 thousand, “other
receivables” to “other assets” for an amount of €32,629 thousand and “tax liabilities” to “liabilities held for
sale” for an amount of €1,792 thousand. These restatements do not have any impact on the reported profit for
the year 2018 or reported equity and an immaterial impact on the cash flow statement for 2018. As a result, we
have not separately restated the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. See note
2.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements.

**_Reporting Segments_**

Our activities primarily comprise the provision of mobile and fixed line communications services
including internet, television and fixed telephony for the consumer and business market in The Netherlands. In
this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” we present,
among others, a revenue disaggregation by customer type. We differentiate between the following types of
customers:

    - _B2C: this segment offers fixed and mobile services (including handset sales) to consumers._

    - _B2B: this segment offers fixed and mobile services (including handset sales) to entrepreneurs and_
enterprises.

    - _Other: this segment consists of other revenues such as wholesale revenues and costs related to the_
Target Group’s headquarters.

Set forth below is a breakdown of our net revenue by customer type for the periods indicated:

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our operations and the operating metrics discussed below have been, and may continue to be, affected
by certain key factors as well as certain historical events and actions. The key factors affecting the ordinary
course of our business and our results of operations are discussed below.

**_Mobile and Fixed Subscriber Base_**

Mobile subscribers consist of subscribers for voice services (including incoming and outgoing calls),
SMS and MMS services, and mobile broadband services (smartphones, wireless internet access through a
laptop, tablet, wireless router or dongle). Fixed subscribers consist of subscribers for FTTH or xDSL broadband
services through one of our fixed line services, TV or telephony packages, as well as other business and
Wholesale Services such as “fiber to the office” services. The evolution of our mobile and fixed subscriber
bases is, and in the periods under review was, driven by market dynamics (including regulatory environment,
competition-driven price evolution, demographics, technological innovation and changing customer behavior),
our ability to capture new subscribers and retain existing subscribers, our acquisitions, and macroeconomic
conditions. See “—Macroeconomic Developments and the Impact of COVID-19 in The Netherlands” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our business is concentrated in The Netherlands, and_
_may be adversely affected by negative economic, legal or political developments in The Netherlands.” A larger_
subscriber base generally results in higher revenue, as the number of our revenue-generating customers
increases. In addition, as a substantial portion of our costs are fixed, a larger subscriber base produces certain
relative cost savings, as efficiencies of scale in our network reduce the costs per customer of delivering our
services and providing customer support. With the acquisition of Tele2 in January 2019 and Simpel in
December 2020, we have substantially increased our subscriber base by covering all consumer segments of the
B2C postpaid market, particularly by offering the full range of premium to low budget products, which we
believe strengthened our position as the largest mobile telecommunications provider in the Dutch consumer
market by mobile service revenue and number of SIMs.

We divide our mobile subscriber base primarily into postpaid and prepaid B2C mobile and postpaid
B2B mobile. In particular, we expect the Dutch B2C mobile postpaid market, which is a key segment of growth
for us, to expand due to growth in postpaid SIMs, driven by prepaid to postpaid migration, increasing use of
second SIMs, population growth and an increased prevalence of younger generations using mobiles phones at
an early age. Similarly, we expect our B2B mobile market to grow across the three main segments: SOHO/VSE,
SMB and LE/CE. Postpaid SIMs are counted in our subscriber base as long as they have an active contract and
prepaid SIMs are counted in our subscriber base as long as a SIM card is connected to our network which has
had at least one chargeable event or incoming traffic event (excluding any traffic initiated by us) within the last
six months. The calculation includes subscribers through wholesale resellers, as we enter into direct contractual
arrangements with customers of resellers, but excludes subscribers through MVNOs, as MVNOs own their
respective subscriber bases. Each connection by a subscriber represents at least one line; however, this may
vary depending on circumstances, and one subscriber may have several lines (for instance, a broadband line,
together with two postpaid lines). We expect our fixed subscriber base to grow due to a household growth,
further FTTH penetration in The Netherlands and better quality. In this regard, in April 2021, we announced a
strategic partnership with Open Dutch Fiber, a company owned by KKR and DTCP, to roll-out fiber services
to over one million homes passed. We are the anchor tenant on the network, which focuses on dense, urban
areas in which we currently have a large mobile market share.

The following chart presents a breakdown of our mobile and fixed line subscribers in our consumer
and business segments as of December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and as of September 30, 2020 and 2021,
presented on a historical pro forma basis to include the pro forma effect of the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel:

In recent years, the use of the internet, television and mobile services has increased in The Netherlands.
We have benefited from this increase and our growth and profitability depend, in part, on the continued demand
for these services in the coming years. Approximately 94% of Dutch households have fixed broadband and
128% of the Dutch population have mobile broadband in 2020 (Source: Digital Economy and Society Index
_(DESI) 2020, European Commission), we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from growth in both the_
mobile and fixed broadband sectors, driven by increasing subscription rates. The Netherlands has the lowest
mobile-only access rate at less than 0.04% of European households, which correlates with the fact that it has
the highest take-up rate of fixed broadband in the European Union. We believe that due to our vast product
offering we are able to respond to fixed broadband and to mobile-only customers. With a mobile coverage per
population of over 99% for 4G and of approximately 92% for 5G, we are able to provide our clients with strong
coverage based on an extensive network footprint and the highest density site grids in urban areas. See also
“Industry, Competition and Market Overview.”

**_ARPU Evolution_**

ARPU has been one of the key factors affecting our revenues and operating results over the past years.
See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” for more information on the calculation of ARPU. The
following table sets forth the development of our ARPU, for the periods indicated, presented on a historical pro
forma basis to include the pro forma effect of the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel:

Tele2 ................................................................ 30.3 30.0 30.0 29.7

_B2B Mobile ............................................................._ 17.2 15.1 13.7 13.0

In recent periods, our B2C mobile ARPU, including both B2C mobile postpaid segment ARPU and
B2C fixed segment ARPU, have remained relatively steady. In particular, though our B2C mobile postpaid
segment ARPU decreased from €16.2 in 2018 to €15.5 in 2020, it has remained relatively steady in more recent
periods, at €15.7 in 2019, €15.5 in 2020 and €15.6 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Factors
such as 5G monetization, growth of unlimited offerings, low-end rationalization initiatives, growth of valueadded services and FMC growth, are expected to keep our B2C mobile ARPU steady in the short term and also
potentially support its growth over time. Our B2C fixed segment ARPU has remained stable (€33.4 in 2018,
€33.5 in 2020 and €33.4 during the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, in each case on a historical pro forma
basis for the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel). We intend to grow our B2C fixed segment ARPU, in particular
in respect of our T-Mobile Thuis brand, by implementing a strategic shift to premium value fixed portfolio over


-----

time. Similarly, though our B2B mobile segment ARPU decreased from €17.2 in 2018 to €13.7 in 2020 (on a
historical pro forma basis for the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel), our B2B mobile segment ARPU has
experienced similar stabilizing trend in more recent periods and we expect it to grow over time. The decline of
ARPU in the segment can mostly be attributed to faster growth in the LE/CE segment compared to growth in
smaller sized segments. Within the B2B mobile segment, ARPU in the SOHO/VSE market segment has grown
recently, driven by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services and value-added services, and we believe
these drivers will continue to have a positive impact on ARPU growth in our B2B segment generally. In
addition, historically, the B2B mobile and in particular the SOHO/VSE segments were negatively impacted by
ARPU declines driven by significant one-off effects, such as the impact of IFRS-15 and decline in roaming
usage due to travel restrictions following the COVID-19 pandemic. Going forward, we do not expect these
factors to negatively impact ARPUs.

**_Multi-brand Strategy to Address Different Customer Segments with Tailored Value Propositions_**

Our multi-brand strategy has allowed us to grow across all customer segments in The Netherlands by
offering different value propositions across key consumer distribution channels. We operate under the TMobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel brands and each of our brands has a distinctive positioning with differentiated
profiles. We position our T-Mobile brand as a premium brand, our Tele2 brand as a value brand and Ben and
Simpel as budget brands. We are the market leader across the entire spectrum with a 42% market share in the
B2C mobile based on our number of postpaid SIM subscribers. We combine strong remote direct sales through
our branded websites and mobile platforms with both our own and third-party call centers, complemented by a
large physical retail network of exclusive stores and distributors. In 2020, our direct and indirect online channels
accounted for more than 60% of our B2C sales. We leverage these channels to offer our customers a range of
service options tailored to their needs through both bundled and flexible unbundled packages, offering
predictable pricing, a strong portfolio of digital channels and customer experience. Our customer services for
Ben and T-Mobile have been voted number one and number two, respectively, in the Dutch telecommunications
industry (Source: MarketResponse). In 2020, Umlaut ranked us as the best mobile network in The Netherlands
for the fifth year in a row, and in 2021, they also ranked us first in their global ranking of all network providers.

From 2018 to 2020, we have increased our market share in the mobile services market from 23.8% to
42.0%, respectively, consistently capturing a large majority of market net adds supported by our acquisitions
of Tele2 and Simpel. Our success in the mobile services market has been driven by our focused commercial
strategy and customer led-approach, allowing us to significantly outperform the Dutch mobile market generally.
Similarly, our market share in the B2C fixed broadband market by subscriber grew from 4.7% in 2018 to 5.7%
in 2020, facilitated by our expanding and improving network footprint. This substantial increase in net adds,
combined with the attractive underlying fundamentals of the Dutch telecommunications market, has resulted in
an overall increase of our mobile subscriber base at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2018 to 2020 and an increase in our
fixed residential broadband subscriber base at a CAGR of 11.5% over the same period.

**_Bundled Offerings, Cross-selling and Migration of Postpaid Subscribers to FMC and Multiple Lines_**

The competitive landscape in The Netherlands is generally characterized by tiered offerings that
include lower priced entry-level products and a focus on bundled offerings, including special promotions and
discounts for customers who subscribe for bundled services and, more recently and as a future trend to take into
consideration, offerings for access to services under 5G networks. Our main competitors offer integrated
products over their fixed line and/or cable networks, including fixed-mobile services bundles comprising
mobile, fixed voice and broadband internet products, as well as 4P bundles that combine these three products
with television services. Bundled services are expected to remain important and customers that have such
services are less likely to switch to a different operator for all or part of the bundled services. We have used and
will continue to use bundled offerings and value added services to attract new customers, and to migrate existing
customers to additional services, by cross-selling broadband to our existing mobile subscriber base and
upselling higher value packages. During the periods under review we have focused our efforts on cross-selling
FMC services and second and third lines to postpaid subscribers, providing discounts to postpaid mobile and
fixed subscribers if they sign up for a bundled offering including FMC services and multiple mobile lines.

**_Material New Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements_**

_Demerger of T-Infra_

On September 1, 2018, we completed the demerger of part of our passive equipment and part of our
rented sites into a separate legal entity, namely Cignal Infrastructure (at demerger and until June 2021 known
as T-Mobile Infra B.V.). Cignal Infrastructure was thereafter transferred to Deutsche Telekom on January 1,
2019, and ceased to form part of our consolidated financial results from that date, with TMNL continuing to
have full access to the contributed infrastructure through a long-term, arms-length service agreement. In June
2021, Deutsche Telekom sold Cignal Infrastructure to Digital Infrastructure Vehicle 1 SCSP a joint venture of
Cellnex and DTCP, and subsequently it was transferred to Cellnex Netherlands B.V. Currently, we benefit from
access to 3,150 towers owned by Cignal Infrastructure with nationwide coverage under a long term contract for
an initial term of 15 years, with the option for T-Mobile Netherlands to renew for two additional periods of 10
years each, and at favorable terms consisting of a capped yearly cost increase in line with the Consumer Price
Index.

_Acquisition of Tele2 and Simpel_

In January 2019, we completed the acquisition of Tele2. The acquisition has strengthened our position
in the Dutch telecommunications market, particularly in the premium mobile segment, allowing us to compete
more effectively with our competitors in the Dutch market, due to enhanced scale, combined spectrum resources
and significant synergy potential. Pursuant to this acquisition, we acquired approximately 1.2 million
subscribers, as of January 2, 2019.

On December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, the largest MVNO in The Netherlands.
This has helped to further consolidate our leading position in the mobile market and expand into a low budget
segment of the Dutch mobile market. Pursuant to this acquisition, we acquired approximately 1.0 million
subscribers, who at the time of the acquisition already used our network pursuant to a network access
arrangement that Simpel had previously entered into with us.

We are executing a three-year plan to realize synergies from our acquisition of Tele2 in 2019. We have
closed Tele2’s standalone stores and we are in the process of implementing significant operations costs savings.
Based on our estimates, we anticipate realizing total cost-saving synergies in connection with Tele2 and Simpel
with a total run-rate synergy potential of €139 million by 2024, having already realized €116 million of
synergies run-rate as of September 30, 2021. Synergies related to Tele2 and Simpel include reduced
interconnect costs, migration of Tele2’s BSS to our Magenta stack, synergies in respect of bad debt collections
(representing improved client acceptance and collection practices implemented upon integration with TMNL),
direct and indirect cost savings related to the discontinuance of the Tele2 network and the cancellation of leased
telecommunications towers, reduction in marketing expenses as a result of mobile cross-selling, optimization
of campaigning periods, reduction in other indirect costs such as personnel related costs as well as legal audit
and tax fees.

**_Capital Expenditure and Network Upgrades_**

Our historical capital expenditure is mainly driven by the acquisition of licenses of frequency spectra,
which occur every eight to ten years and are a necessary capital expenditure for our mobile network. These
frequencies are auctioned by the Dutch government and are generally valid for 15 to 20 years, after which the
licenses are put up for auction again. The first 5G frequencies were auctioned in mid-2020 and we were able to
acquire bands on the 700 MHz and 1,400 MHz frequencies for the first time as well as re-acquire our previouslyowned 2,100 MHz spectrum. As of December 31, 2020, we had the largest mobile spectrum portfolio in The
Netherlands, ranging from low frequency (700 MHz) to high frequency (2,600 MHz), with no reinvestment
required until 2030. We intend to participate in the new 3.5 GHz spectrum auction, which is currently expected
in the second half of 2022.

Our business capital expenditure primarily consists of Mobile Capital Expenditure (which represents
capital expenditure relating to expansion and/or improvement of our mobile network infrastructure and is
calculated as the sum of capital expenditure relating to (i) modernization of RAN to ensure full 5G capabilities


-----

and the roll-out of low frequency 5G-ready bands and (ii) other expansion or improvement of our mobile
network, such as in relation to quality improvement and network evolution projects and capital expenditure to
increase capacity), Fixed Capital Expenditure (which represents capital expenditure necessary to maintain and
expand our fixed infrastructure, and is primarily related to (i) capacity extension and upgrades of our fixed
infrastructure, (ii) investments in active equipment in new roll-out areas, (iii) customer-premise equipment for
new customers and (iv) quality improvements and phase out of legacy networks). IT Capital Expenditure (which
represents capital expenditure relating to the ongoing IT transformation and our cloud-first strategy) and Other
Capital Expenditure (which represents certain other heads of capital expenditures incurred by us, such as in
relation to the acquisition and post-acquisition integration related capital expenditure as well as certain other
miscellaneous heads of capital expenditure such as in relation building facilities and retail outlets). During the
last three financial years, we have spent in the aggregate €337.4 million as Mobile Capital Expenditure (€79.7
million in 2018, €143.0 million in 2019, €114.7 million in 2020). We spent in the aggregate €166.4 million as
Fixed Capital Expenditure (€22.3 million in 2018, €64.5 million in 2019, €79.6 million in 2020). In addition,
we spent in the aggregate €124.9 million as IT Capital Expenditure (€41.6 million in 2018, €44.6 million in
2019 and €38.7 million in 2020) and in the aggregate €78.1 million as Other Capital Expenditure (€2.7 million
in 2018, €38.8 million in 2019 and €36.6 million in 2020). See also “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
_Capital Expenditure” and “Summary—Summary Financial Information and Other Data—Capital Expenditure_
_Data.”_

In particular, in addition to other factors such as the impact of adoption of IFRS 16, our business capital
expenditure has resulted in an increase in our fixed assets. Our total property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) and
intangible assets as of December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and as of September 30, 2021, based on acquisition
costs, is summarized in the following table:

**_Macroeconomic Developments and the Impact of COVID-19 in The Netherlands_**

As we operate entirely in The Netherlands, our business and results of operations are influenced by
macroeconomic developments in the Dutch economy. To the extent they relate to and influence rates of
consumer confidence and spending in The Netherlands, rates of Dutch unemployment, GDP growth and other
macroeconomic metrics can impact the amount of money that Dutch consumers spend on our products and
services and thus impact our sales and results of operations. GDP growth and other economic metrics may also
correlate with rates of business investment in The Netherlands, and can thus impact our sales to business
customers. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dutch GDP increased by 1.96% in 2019, continuing its
process of gradual deceleration from the average GDP growth rate of 2.4% from 2016-2018, but still
significantly higher than the average GDP growth rate of 1.1% during the period from 2013-2015. Additionally,
the inflation rate was on average 2.6% in 2019, well above from 1.1% in 2016-2018 and from 1.4% in 20132015.

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many countries, including The
Netherlands, have taken preventative measures to try to contain its spread. These measures have included
mandatory closure of businesses, social distancing requirements and travel restrictions, which have severely
diminished the level of economic activity around the world and in The Netherlands, caused significant volatility


-----

in financial markets and triggered a period of global economic slowdown, the extent and duration of which
remain uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic and the multiple waves of infections that have been recorded have
severely impacted the economies of the European Union, including The Netherlands. In particular, the World
Bank registered a contraction for the European Union’s real GDP of 5.9% in 2020 and forecasts deeper
continuing impacts on those economies dependent on international tourism as well as those dependent on
international trade, as supply bottlenecks persist (Source: World Bank, Global Economic Prospects January
_2021; June 2021). In The Netherlands, employment and working hours were negatively impacted, with the_
unemployment rate increasing by 1.9% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2020 and total working hours
bottoming out at an aggregate loss of 7.7 average weekly hours in May of 2020 (Source: Institute of Labor
_Economics, Drivers of Working Hours and Household Income Dynamics during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The_
_Case of The Netherlands). COVID-19 caseload waves and concomitant containment measures were associated_
with exceptional declines in consumer spending in two waves in 2020, reaching 17% and 12% declines in
consumer spending year-over-year in April and December of 2020, respectively (Source: Statistics
_Netherlands). Eurostat has registered a contraction of the Dutch economy of 3.7% in 2020 (source: Eurostat)._
However, due to a steady vaccination drive and the resulting stimulation in economic activity, consumption and
public confidence, the OECD has projected a steady rebound of the Dutch economy in 2021, with a projected
GDP growth of 3.5% in 2021. For 2022, the OECD has currently forecast a growth of 3.0%. The annual average
unemployment rate is expected to be 4.12% in 2021 and 4.66% in 2022. (Source: OECD).

In response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 16, 2020 we temporarily closed all of
our retail shops, and thereafter, beginning March 21, 2020 and in compliance with regulations and guidance
issued by the Dutch government, we gradually reopened some of our retail shops in a ‘box-in shop’ format,
whereby our retail shops were installed with Plexiglas walls enabling our employees and consumers to safely
interact with each other. In June 2020, we reopened the entirety of our retail shops while implementing social
distancing measures. On December 15, 2020, the Dutch government ordered the closure of all non-essential
commercial and retail businesses in The Netherlands and, in compliance with this directive, we closed all of
our retail shops for sale while remaining open for service as it qualified as essential services. In April 2021, we
progressively reopened our retail stores while requiring certain social distancing and other safety measures to
be observed.

In addition, the self-isolation measures imposed by the Dutch government in order to combat COVID19 have resulted in a considerable increase in internet traffic, as customers increasingly relied on VoIP and OTT
services while gatherings are prohibited and residents are advised to stay at home. The COVID-19 pandemic
positively impacted our B2B segment, as people worked remotely, leading to an increase in calls, data usage,
video-conferencing and other services requested by business customers. However, COVID-19 pandemic had a
negative impact on our roaming revenues due to travel restrictions imposed on our customers by many countries
and territories around the world meant that mobile roaming remained limited during this period. Our networks
continue to be stable and we believe are able to cope well with the additional volume caused by increased
numbers of people working from home.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Results of Operations**

**_Acquisitions and Demerger and other Arrangements_**

We have made two material acquisitions during the periods under review. The assets and operations
acquired in such transactions are not fully reflected across all periods that are included in our Historical
Consolidated Financial Statements. We also undertook a material demerger of infrastructure assets during this
period. The impact of these acquisitions as well as the demerger should be taken into account when comparing
the Historical Consolidated Financial Statements across the periods included therein.

These acquisitions and the demerger consist of the following, in chronological order:

    - on September 1, 2018, we completed the demerger of part of our passive equipment and part of
our rented sites to a separate legal entity, Cignal Infrastructure (at demerger and until June 2021,
T-Infra). Subsequently, Cignal Infrastructure was transferred to Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V.
on January 1, 2019, and ceased to form part of our consolidated financial results from that date;


-----

    - on January, 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Tele2’s Dutch operations, and it has been
consolidated into our financial results from that date;

    - on December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, and it has been consolidated into
our financial results from that date.

Following the Acquisition, our business operations will be separated from Deutsche Telekom and run
as a stand-alone business. In this regard, and at the time of completion of the Acquisition, we expect to enter
into certain transitional services agreements, including with Tele2. As a result of the separation, we do not
expect our cost base to change materially. In addition, going forward our business would not avail of financing
from the Deutsche Telekom, and we expect to fulfil our liquidity requirements mainly from net cash generated
from operating activities, the Notes, drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement (including the RCF) and
the factoring arrangements entered into by us from time to time. Pursuant to our separation from Deutsche
Telekom, we expect to be able to streamline our reporting and management information systems and expect to
achieve certain related efficiencies. See also “Business— Separation from Deutsche Telekom” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Separation from Deutsche Telekom.”_

**_Seasonality_**

We regularly experience a slight seasonality in postpaid mobile revenue during two quarters, as
described below, while seasonality is fairly low for our other services:

    - _First Quarter. Revenue in the first quarter is generally less compared to the following quarters in_
the financial year due to the fact that this quarter has one to two less days than the second and the
fourth quarter. This only affects customers in pay-per-use voice tariffs.

    - _Third Quarter. Some revenue uplift is linked to the growth of out of bundle usage by postpaid_
mobile lines, due to customers leaving their regular residence and place of work where they have
access to broadband and Wi-Fi, whereas they tend to have more limited access to Wi-Fi on
vacation, increasing their data usage. This mostly affects customers having tariffs with a low data
allowance and prepaid mobile lines.

**_Adoption of IFRS 16_**

The mandatory first-time application of the new the IFRS 16 (Leases) accounting standard, effective
from January 1, 2019, had a material impact on our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Since expenses
and cash outflows for leases are substantial elements of our earnings performance and solvency, we have taken
into account the effects of IFRS 16 (Leases) when determining our financial performance indicators. On
September 1, 2018, we demerged Cignal Infrastructure (at demerger and until June 2021, T-Infra), consisting
primarily of passive infrastructure and site lease agreements, and subsequently transferred the entity as a
dividend in kind to Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V. on January 1, 2019. After the demerger, we entered into a
lease agreement with Cignal Infrastructure regarding the demerged passive infrastructure and sites. As of
January 1, 2019, the passive equipment previously carried at cost and the right of use assets related to the
greenfield and rooftop spaces, each of which were previously accounted as indirect costs, are now accounted
as leases under IFRS 16. In order to ensure maximum comparability with our previous performance indicators,
we measure our operational performance on the basis of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, which is calculated
as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to exclude the impact of IFRS 16, thereby including operating
lease expenses in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in order to arrive at a closer alignment with cash EBITDA.

**_Reporting_**

We present the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements in this Offering Memorandum. After
completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group may not prepare separate consolidated financial statements
and we instead may report our consolidated financial results at the level of the Parent. Due to this, our future
financial statements may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included
in this Offering Memorandum. Our future financial statements could be materially different once the


-----

adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements
included in this Offering Memorandum.

**Key Income Statement Items**

**_Net revenue_**

Net revenue relates to all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Target Group, including
revenue from rendering of mobile telecommunication services, revenue from the sales of goods and
merchandise and revenue from the rendering of fixed line services. Revenues are recorded net of value-added
tax and other taxes collected from customers. Value-added tax and other taxes collected are remitted to
governmental authorities.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income relates to income from intercompany charges and miscellaneous other
operating income such as charge back to shareholders for employees on the Target Group’s payroll and gain in
fair value of assets.

**_Own capitalized costs_**

Own capitalized costs represents capitalization of workforce cost relating to roll out and capacity
expansions in our mobile and fixed network and the development of platforms for cellular sites.

**_Goods and services purchased_**

Goods and services purchased relates to expenses for raw materials and supplies, merchandise and for
services purchased, such as cost of handset devices, fixed access services, roaming costs for mobile subscribers,
marketing and sales costs and commission, and costs relating to energy and logistics.

**_Personnel costs_**

_Net revenue_

Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €1,536.5 million, an increase of €89.7
million, or 6.2%, compared to €1,446.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due
to the acquisition of Simpel, which was completed on December 1, 2020. Accordingly, revenue from Simpel
was consolidated with our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (contributing €88.0 million),
whereas our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 did not consolidate any revenue from Simpel.
In addition, the increase in net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2020, was, among other things, due to the increase in the subscriber base of our
T-Mobile and Ben brands in our B2C mobile operations and our B2C fixed operations.

Net revenue for our B2C segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €1,213.2 million,
an increase of €136.3 million, or 12.7%, compared to €1,076.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of Simpel resulting in a larger customer base, an increase in ARPU
for the B2C segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, and the increase in subscriber base in
relation to our T-Mobile and Ben brands in our B2C mobile operations and our B2C fixed operations.

Net revenue for our B2B segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €268.1 million,
a decrease of €4.2 million, or 1.6%, compared to €263.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
primarily due to growth in subscriber base in our B2B segment during these periods, partially offset by a
decrease in the ARPU for the B2B segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (€13.0 per month,
calculated on an historical basis) as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020 (€13.7 per month,
calculated on an historical basis), driven by an increase in the mix of LE/CE customer segment, which has
historically generated a relatively lower ARPU.

Net revenue for our other segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €55.1 million,
a decrease of €50.8 million, or 48.0%, compared to €106.0 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2020, primarily due to the acquisition of Simpel. Prior to completion of this acquisition and during the nine
months ended September 30, 2020, Simpel was the largest MVNO in The Netherlands and we shared our
network with Simpel against payment of network access fees, which were recorded as other income. Upon
completion of the acquisition of Simpel, such network access arrangements were terminated and no network
access fees from Simpel were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

_Other operating income_

Other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €0.4 million, a decrease
of €2.6 million, or 86.7% compared to €3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily
due to the fact that indemnification assets relating to “all-in subscriptions” contract claims was recognized
during the nine months September 30, 2020 (€1.7 million).

These claims relate to our prior and discontinued offer of ‘free handsets’ to consumers along with
mobile subscriptions, referred to as ‘all-in subscriptions.’ In 2014 and 2016, the Supreme Court of The
Netherlands ruled that such offerings were not compliant with statutory provisions on installment purchases,
credit transactions and credit agreements. In this regard, multiple claims vehicles and foundations have solicited
individuals to initiate mass claims against telecommunications providers who offered such all-in subscriptions,
and as a result, we have recognized provisions in our financial statements for potential payout of these claims.
Individual consumers were able to file their potential claim until September 1, 2019, and pursuant to an
agreement reached by us in October 2020 with a joint venture organization, we have finalized processing claims
from this organization as of date while others are still pending. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to

of €2.2 million, or 16.3%, compared to €13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily
due to capitalization of increased workforce costs relating to internalization of certain technology management
functions, which were previous carried out by an external vendor.

increase of €68.3 million, or 8.7%, compared to €782.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
primarily due to an increase in the costs of handset devices, which was primarily driven by an increase in the
sales of handset devices and increase in the costs relating to fixed access services, which was primarily driven
by an increase in our fixed subscriber base.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were €126.1 million, an increase of
€2.6 million, or 2.1%, compared to €123.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily
due to an increase in provisions for future payments under the share appreciation rights scheme instituted by
us.

million, an increase of €6.1 million, or 60.4%, compared to €10.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020, primarily due to release of bad debt provisions during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting
from the clearance and reassessment of bad debt provision for accounts receivable balances of Tele2, upon
migration of Tele2 systems to our systems and methodology.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were €16.2 million, a
decrease of €5.7 million, or 26.0%, compared to €21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
primarily due to lower legal and advisory expenses (€1.2) million and multiple individually smaller items within
miscellaneous expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

million, or 3.4%, compared to €525.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to
the increase in net revenues, driven by the acquisition of Simpel and an increase in our subscriber base, and
partially offset by an increase in goods and services purchased, driven by an increase in the costs of handset
devices and increases in costs relating to fixed access services.

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_

Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were
€362.4 million, an increase of €9.8 million, or 2.8% compared to €352.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in amortization and impairment of intangible assets (€3.1
million), and depreciation and impairment of PPE (€29.2 million), mainly driven by higher capital expenditure
resulting in higher depreciation and impairment, partially offset by lower depreciation of leases (€22.4 million),
mainly driven by a decrease in our lease base, including due to closure of the former Tele2 head office and
dismantling of former Tele2’s mobile network sites, in each case during the nine months ended September 30,
2021

Net finance (expense)/income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was an expense of €70.6
million, compared to an expense of €69.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase
of €1.1 million, or 1.6%, due to an increase in net finance cost partially offset by an increase in other financial
expenses, as described above.

or 1.7%, compared to €1,914.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher mobile
service revenues and higher fixed services revenues, which was mainly driven by a growth in subscriber base
in the B2C and B2B segments during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019. In addition, the acquisition of Simpel, which was completed on December 1, 2020, had a
positive impact on our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as we consolidated revenue from
Simpel for the period from December 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 (contributing €4.6 million).

Net revenue for our B2C segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €1,459.3 million, an
increase of €33.3 million, or 2.3%, compared to €1,426.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,

segment and consolidation of the revenue from Simpel for the period from December 1, 2020 to December 31,
2020.

Net revenue for our B2B segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €354.9 million, a
decrease of €49.8 million, or 12.3%, compared to €404.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to certain wholesale carrier revenues (€37.3 million) being recorded in the B2B segment for the
year ended December 31, 2019 and which was subsequently recorded in the other segment during the year
ended December 31, 2020.

Net revenue for our other segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €134.3 million, an
increase of €50.0 million, or 59.3%, compared to €84.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily
due to certain wholesale carrier revenues (€37.3 million) being recorded in the B2B segment for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and which was subsequently recorded in the other segment during the year ended December
31, 2020. This increase was partially offset by completion of the Simpel acquisition on December 1, 2020,

Goods and services purchased for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €1,076.2 million, a decrease
of €33.2 million, or 3.0%, compared to €1,109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due
to lower cost relating to handset devices and lower cost of services purchased for acquiring and maintaining
customers (such as marketing and sales costs and commission).

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €166.8 million, a decrease of €6.4 million,
or 3.7%, compared to €173.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to reduction of

€13.2 million, or 30.9%, compared to €42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to
reduced advisory and consultation costs, which were higher in the year ended December 31, 2019 in light of
the Tele2 acquisition and movements in relation to the recognition of provisions relating to “all-in
subscriptions” contract claims, partially offset by reduction in costs relating to factoring facilities.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €706.7 million, an increase of €121.4 million, or
20.7%, compared to €585.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the increase in net
revenues, driven by higher mobile service revenues and higher fixed services revenues, increase in operating
income, driven by gain in the fair value of the call options to acquire Simpel and decrease in in goods and
services purchased, driven by lower cost relating to handset devices and certain services purchased.


-----

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_

Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €475.3
million, a decrease of €42.8 million, or 8.3%, compared to €518.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, primarily due to lower depreciation of fixed assets of Tele2 during the year ended December 31, 2020,
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Profit from operations (EBIT)_

As a result of the factors described above, our profit from operations (EBIT) for the year ended
December 31, 2020 was €231.4 million, an increase of €164.3 million compared to €67.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

or 1.4%, compared to a €97.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to increase in our debt
obligations, primarily driven by the increased borrowing under the Existing Target Group 2020 Facility to
finance the Simpel acquisition.

As a result of the movement in the interest income and interest expense as described above, net finance
costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €95.2 million, an increase of €1.4 million, or 1.5%, compared
to €93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Other financial (expense)/income_

Other financial (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented an income of
€0.2 million, compared to an expense of €0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to changes in
the measurement of provision for transactions in foreign currencies.

Gain/(loss) from other financial activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a gain of €0.2
million compared to a loss of €0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to certain changes in the
measurement of provision for transactions in foreign currencies, which also resulted in an increase in other
financial expenses as described above.

_Net finance (expense)/income_

_Net revenue_

Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €1,914.9 million, an increase of €594.3 million,
or 45.0%, compared to €1,320.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the acquisition
of Tele2, which was completed on January 2, 2019. Accordingly, revenue from Tele2 was consolidated with
our results for the year ended December 31, 2019 (contributing €597.0 million), whereas our results for the year
ended December 31, 2018 did not consolidate revenue from Tele2. In addition, the increase in net revenue for
year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was, among other things,
due to the increase in our subscriber base in relation to our T-Mobile and Ben brands in our B2C mobile
operations and T-Mobile Thuis brand in our B2C fixed operations, partially offset by a slight decrease in our
B2C Mobile postpaid ARPU during the same period (from €17.6 per month during the year ended December
31, 2018 to €17.2 per month during the year ended December 31, 2019, in each case calculated on an historical
basis and excluding the impact of the Tele2 B2C Mobile postpaid ARPU).

Net revenue for our B2C segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €1,426.0 million, an
increase of €477.9 million, or 50.4%, compared to €948.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This
increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Tele2 resulting in a larger customer base (an addition of
approximately 1.2 million subscribers, as of January 2, 2019 and a revenue of €336.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019) and the increase in subscriber base in relation to our T-Mobile and Ben brands in our B2C


-----

mobile operations and T-Mobile Thuis brand in our B2C fixed operations, partially offset by a slight decrease
in our B2C mobile postpaid ARPU during the same period, as described above.

Net revenue for our B2B segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €404.7 million, an
increase of €151.1 million, or 59.6%, compared to €253.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018
primarily due to our acquisition of Tele2 resulting in a larger customer base, partially offset by a decrease in
our B2B mobile ARPU during the same period (from €18.4 per month during the year ended December 31,
2018 to €15.1 per month during the year ended December 31, 2019, in each case calculated on an historical
basis and excluding the impact of the Tele2 B2B mobile ARPU for the relevant period).

Net revenue for our other segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €84.3 million, a decrease
of €34.7 million, or 29.1%, compared to €118.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to
the elimination of certain revenue streams from Tele2, such as in relation to handset revenue and interconnection
charges, which we gradually eliminated pursuant to the acquisition of Tele2 in January 2, 2019.

_Other operating income_

Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €2.0 million, a decrease of €8.4
million, or 80.7%, compared to €10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease
in miscellaneous other operating income, driven by the demerger of T-Infra, which became effective on January
1, 2019 and resulted in elimination of site income from the other MNOs who previously used the demerged
assets, partially offset by our acquisition of Tele2 on January 2, 2019, which resulted in a release of certain
provisions relating to network sharing with Tele2.

_Own capitalized costs_

Own capitalized costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were €16.9 million, an increase of €7.7
million, or 83.7%, compared to €9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by the
Tele2 acquisition and the resulting increase in capitalization of increased workforce costs.

_Goods and services purchased_

Goods and services purchased for the year ended December 31, 2019 were €1,109.4 million, an
increase of €328.1 million, or 42.0%, compared to €781.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to the acquisition of Tele2 and the consequent increase in our subscriber base which increased
our goods and services purchased and an increase in our rental and leasing costs pursuant to the demerger of TInfra.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were €173.2 million, an increase of €69.5
million, or 67.0%, compared to €103.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an
increase in salaries and wages (€59.3 million) and an increase in social security contributions (€7.6 million)
driven by an increase in our employee base due to the acquisition of Tele2.

_Net impairment losses on financial assets_

Net impairment losses on financial assets for the year ended December 31, 2019 remained relatively
flat at €23.3 million compared to €23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were €42.7 million, an increase of
€30.3 million, compared to €12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increase in
legal, consulting and audit fees miscellaneous other expenses driven by the Tele2 acquisition.


-----

_EBITDA_

EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €585.3 million, an increase of €165.7 million, or
39.5%, as compared to €419.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the increase in
net revenues, driven by the acquisition of Tele2 and increase in our subscriber base, which was offset by an
increase in goods and services purchased and personnel costs, in each case driven by the acquisition of Tele2.

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_

Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were €518.1
million, an increase of €307.1 million compared to €211.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to an increase in amortization and impairment of intangible assets (€77.2 million) and
depreciation and impairment of PPE (€118.3 million), in each case during the year ended December 31, 2019
and driven by the Tele2 acquisition.

_Profit from operations (EBIT)_

As a result of the factors described above, profit from operations (EBIT) for the year ended December
31, 2019 was €67.1 million, a decrease of €141.5 million, or 67.8%, compared to €208.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

_Net finance costs_

Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €3.8 million, an increase of €3.7 million
compared to €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the Tele2 merger and the
resulting increase in interest income relating to site sharing receivables.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €97.6 million, an increase of €95.6 million
compared to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the increase in shareholder
loan borrowed by us from Deutsche Telekom and the impact of adoption of IFRS 16, beginning from January
1, 2019.

As a result of the movement in the interest income and interest expense as described above, net finance
costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €93.8 million, an increase of €91.9 million compared to €1.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Other financial expense_

Other financial expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €0.3 million, as compared to €0.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to losses from transactions in foreign currency.

_Gain/(loss) from other financial activities_

Loss from other financial activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €0.3 million, as
compared to €0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of €0.1 million due to losses from
transactions in foreign currency, which also resulted in an increase in other financial expenses as described
above.

_Results from financial activities_

Results from financial activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a loss of €94.1 million,
compared to a loss of €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of €92.0 million, primarily
due to an increase in net finance cost, as described above.


-----

_Profit/(loss) before income taxes_

As a result of the factors described above, profit/loss before income taxes, for the year ended December
31, 2019, was a loss of €27.0 million, as compared to a profit of €206.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2018, representing an increase of €233.6 million.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 were a benefit of €22.3 million, compared to an
expense of €113.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a variation of €136.2 million, due to a loss
before tax and a positive tax effect of changes in tax rate, partially offset by certain non-deductible expenses,
during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a profit before tax and impairment due to the
adjustment of future tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Result for the year_

As a result of the factors described above, result for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a loss of
€4.7 million, compared to a profit of €92.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of €97.3
million.

_Cash flow from operating activities_

We generated €293.7 million of cash from our operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 compared to €438.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of
€145.0 million, or 33.1%. The decrease in cash generation from operating activities is primarily attributable to
changes in trade and intercompany payables following payment by the Target Group for the 700Mhz spectrum
during the nine months ended September 21, 2021.

_Cash flow used in investing activities_

We used €200.9 million of cash in our investing activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 compared to €377.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of €176.3 million
or 46.7%. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to lower investments in
intangible assets (€169.5 million) such as 700 Mhz spectrum and lower investment in PPE (€16.7 million), in
each case, during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2020.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

We used €108.0 million of cash from our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 compared to €103.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in cash flow
from financing activities is primarily attributable to higher cash outflow from continuing involvement factoring
(€4.8 million).

_Cash flow from operating activities_

We generated an aggregate amount of €581.6 million of cash from our operating activities for the year
ended December 31, 2020 compared to €429.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in
cash generation from operating activities is primarily attributable to an increase in operating profits (€164.3
million), change in working capital (€50.0 million) and increased income tax receipts (€24.6 million), partially
offset by certain non-cash adjustments (€85.7 million).

_Cash flow used in investing activities_

We used an aggregate amount of €695.2 million of cash in our investing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2020 compared to €481.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash
used in investing activities is primarily attributable to increased investments in intangible assets (€158.3
million), such as 5G spectrum, and payment of consideration for the acquisition of Simpel, which was fully
funded pursuant to a long-term intercompany loan from Deutsche Telekom.

_Cash flow from/(used in) financing activities_

We generated an aggregate amount of €138.7 million of cash from our financing activities for the year
ended December 31, 2020 compared to a cash outflow of €97.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase in cash generated from financing activities is primarily attributable to proceeds from the long-term
intercompany loan from Deutsche Telekom (€270.0 million), dividend payments in year ended 2019 with no
corresponding payment in the year ended December 31, 2020 (€57.7 million), partially offset by increased lease
payments relating to leased assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019 (€104.2 million).

_Cash flow from operating activities_

We generated €429.8 million of cash from our operating activities for the year ended December 31,
2019 compared to €394.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash generation from
operating activities is primarily attributable to increase in operating profits as a result of the merger with Tele2
(€362.4 million).

_Cash flow used in investing activities_

We used €481.4 million of cash in our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019
compared to a cash outflow of €145.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used
in investing activities is primarily attributable to partial payment for the acquisition of Tele2 (€196.7 million)
and investments in PPE (€129.3 million), driven by increased capital expenditure in our network.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

We used €97.3 million of cash in our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019
compared to a cash outflow of €505.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash used
in financing activities is primarily attributable to repayment of long-term intercompany payables, such as
repayment of certain financing facilities we previously borrowed from Deutsche Telekom (€500 million) during
the year ended December 31, 2018 with no corresponding repayment by us during the year ended December
31, 2019.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our liquidity requirements consist mainly of debt servicing requirements, investments in bolt-on
acquisitions, Mobile Capital Expenditure and Fixed Infrastructure Capital Expenditure. Historically, our
principal sources of liquidity have been our net cash generated from operating activities, share capital increases,
factoring arrangements entered into by us and borrowings under our financing arrangements, including
financing facilities from Deutsche Telekom. Going forward, in addition to net cash generated from operating
activities, we expect our principal sources of liquidity to include the Notes, drawings under the Senior Facilities
Agreement (including the RCF) and the factoring arrangements entered into by us from time to time.

RCF1 under the Senior Facilities Agreement provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to
€500.0 million in revolving credit, and RCF2 under the Senior Facilities Agreement provides for an aggregate
principal amount of up to €200.0 million in revolving credit, both of which were undrawn as of September 30,
2021. Subject to certain exceptions and conditions, each of RCF1 and RCF2 may be borrowed, repaid and
reborrowed thereunder at any time in accordance with the Senior Facilities Agreement. For further information,
see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.”

After the completion of the Transactions, we will have €800.0 million in aggregate principal amount
of Senior Secured Notes outstanding, €550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes
outstanding and €2,400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans under the Senior Facilities
Agreement (excluding amounts drawn by us from time to time under RCF1 and RCF2), in addition to certain
other financial indebtedness as described under “Capitalization.”

The Issuers are holding companies with no material operations or assets of their own. As a result, the
Issuers will primarily depend on the cash flow generated by the operating subsidiaries of the Group and paid to
the Issuers by way of interest payments under, or repayments of, the relevant intercompany loans or otherwise


-----

to meet their obligations, including their respective obligations under the Notes and the Senior Facilities
Agreement. The relevant Issuer’s ability to pay cash interest on the Notes offered hereby will be determined by
its cash available for debt service.

As of September 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuers and the
Guarantors would have had €4,528.4 million in aggregate principal amount of third-party debt, including €760.7
million of lease liabilities under IFRS 16 and €17.7 million in respect of our factoring facilities.

While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating
requirements, our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn
dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in
the section titled “Risk Factors.” For further information, see the section titled “Capitalization.”

**_Working Capital_**

We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. This financial measure represents
our operating liquidity. As of September 30, 2021, we had a working capital of €28.7 million, compared to a
negative working capital of €85.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and a working capital of €142.5 million as
of December 31, 2019 and €444.0 million as of December 31, 2018. The movement in our working capital
across the periods under review generally reflects the significant growth of our business in such periods. In
particular, negative working capital results from our business model and financial structure, that we believe to
be typical for telecommunications service providers and is not a barrier to the normal operation of our business.

The following table shows our working capital as of the dates indicated:

**Working capital ....................................................** **444,040** **142,480** **(85,405)** **28,719**

Working capital as of September 30, 2021 was €28.7 million, an increase of €114.1 million, compared
to negative working capital of €85.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase of our working capital was
primarily due to lower inventory as a result of the global chip shortage and a lower factoring balance.

Working capital as of December 31, 2020 was negative €85.4 million, a decrease of €227.9 million
compared to a working capital of €142.5 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in our working capital
was primarily due to the change in trade and other payables following the recognition of an accrual for payment
of the acquisition of the 700Mhz spectrum.


-----

Working capital as of December 31, 2019 was €142.5 million, a decrease of €301.6 million, or 67.9%,
compared to a working capital of €444.0 million as of December 31, 2018. The decrease of our working capital
was primarily due to increased trade receivables and the change in trade payables and lease liabilities.

**_Capital Expenditure_**

Our business capital expenditure consists of:

    - Mobile Capital Expenditure, which represents capital expenditure relating to expansion and/or
improvement of our mobile network infrastructure and is calculated as the sum of capital
expenditure relating to (i) modernization of RAN to ensure full 5G capabilities and the roll-out of
low frequency 5G-ready bands and (ii) other expansion or improvement of our mobile network,
such as in relation to quality improvement and network evolution projects and capital expenditure
to increase capacity. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we incurred
Mobile Capital Expenditure of €79.7 million, €143.0 million and €114.7 million, respectively. For
the year ended December 31, 2021, we expect to incur Mobile Capital Expenditure of
approximately €103 million. Since the year ended December 21, 2018, we have continued with
our initiatives to upgrade our mobile network, primarily through the installation of active antennas
on the 1800MHz and 2600MHZ time division duplex bands. In particular, during the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020, we significantly increased our Mobile Capital Expenditure,
primarily in relation to the preparation of the 5G rollout on the low band and adding extra capacity
and coverage by preparing for introducing the 800MHz band into use. During the current period,
the main focus of our Mobile Capital Expenditure has been in relation to the continuing rollout of
the low bands 700/800/900Mhz networks and ramping up the 1800/2100Mhz hardware
replacement.

    - Fixed Capital Expenditure, which represents capital expenditure necessary to maintain and expand
our fixed infrastructure, and is primarily related to (i) capacity extension and upgrades of our fixed
infrastructure, (ii) investments in active equipment in new roll-out areas, (iii) customer-premise
equipment for new customers and (iv) quality improvements and phase out of legacy networks.
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we incurred Fixed Capital
Expenditure of €22.3 million, €64.5 million and €79.6 million, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 2021, we expect to incur Fixed Capital Expenditure of approximately €106 million,
Prior to the year ended December 31, 2019, we had a relatively small fixed network. With the
acquisition of Tele2 on January 2, 2019, we expanded our owned base of fixed network
infrastructure. Since then, along with the growth of our fixed subscriber base, we have sought to
expand our fixed network, and one of the key drivers of increase in our Fixed Capital Expenditure
during the periods under discussion, has been in relation to customer-premise equipment for new
customers. In addition, our Fixed Capital Expenditure initiatives have also been focused on
addition of capacity in respect of our T-Mobile Thuis network so as to accommodate the continued
growth of our fixed network subscribers, as well as improving the quality, and where appropriate,
phasing-out of legacy fixed networks.

    - IT Capital Expenditure, which represents capital expenditure relating to the ongoing IT
transformation and our cloud-first strategy. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and
2020, we incurred IT Capital Expenditure of €41.6 million, €44.6 million and €38.7 million,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we expect to incur IT Capital Expenditure
of approximately €44 million. Since the year ended December 31, 2018, our IT Capital
Expenditure initiatives have been focused on the implementation of customer relationship
management or “CRM”-related upgrades to our IT systems and infrastructure, including
digitization initiatives to supports our B2C and B2B segments. In addition, since the year ended
December 31, 2019, we have implemented a new vertical sourcing model, so as to move our IT
systems to a cloud-based network.

    - Other Capital Expenditure, which represents certain other heads of capital expenditures incurred
by us, such as in relation to the acquisition and post-acquisition integration related capital


-----

expenditure as well as certain other miscellaneous heads of capital expenditure such as in relation
building facilities and retail outlets. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2019,
we incurred Other Capital Expenditure of €2.7 million, €38.8 million and €35.9 million,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021 we expect to incur Other Capital Expenditure
of approximately €36 million. The higher Capital Expenditure from 2019 onwards is primarily in
relation to the integration of our Tele2 acquisition. In relation to the Tele2 acquisition, which we
completed on January 2, 2019, the key focus of capital expenditure was in relation to postacquisition integration initiatives, particularly in relation to increasing our mobile network to
accommodate all Tele2 traffic and subscribers and to phase-out the Tele2 mobile network. In
relation to the Simpel acquisition, which we completed on December 1, 2020, our capital
expenditure was relatively limited. In connection with the Acquisition, we expect to incur capital
expenditure under the Transition Services Agreement, particularly in relation to the separation of
our management functions from Deutsche Telekom, ring-fencing of our systems and operations,
obtaining of new licenses and entering into new contracts, and the migration of some of our
operation systems to an independent network. See also “Summary—Summary Financial
_Information and Other Data—Capital Expenditure Data.”_

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we expect to incur a total capital expenditure of approximately
€289 million. Set forth below is a breakdown of our historical capital expenditure for the relevant periods:

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of September 30, 2021, we have provided certain bank guarantees to secure the performance of our
obligations, among others, under our licenses and supplier contracts. As of September 30, 2021, we have issued
bank guarantees in the amount of €3.0 million (December 31, 2020: €3.6 million). Further, as of September 30,
2021, we have also entered into certain purchase commitment contracts, including in relation to inventories
(including handsets) and property, plant and equipment resulting in commitments of €182.7 million (December
31, 2020: €214.2 million.

Further, we have entered into partnership agreements with Primevest and Open Dutch Fiber to roll-out
Fiber-to-the-Home (“FTTH”) throughout The Netherlands. Pursuant to the partnership agreement with
Primevest, the first cluster, Segbroek in The Hague, was delivered in November 2019. Under the partnership
agreement with Primevest, we have a minimum commitment of 10 years to pay a fixed percentage of the homes
passed (amounting to €5.4 million) for the period beyond the exclusivity period (after year three) and until year
10 for this sub-cluster. We entered into a partnership agreement with Open Dutch Fiber on April 1, 2021. This
partnership agreement is over an initial 20-year period with a minimum commitment to pay for a fixed
percentage of the homes passed for the period beyond the exclusivity (after year one per cluster).

**_Factoring Arrangements_**

From time to time, we also enter into factoring arrangements in respect of receivables owed to us.
These receivables include both telecom charges already due and receivables from sales of handsets to customers
payable over a period of up to two years. The terms of our existing factoring agreements between 2022 and
2023. The factoring arrangements entered into by us typically involve (a) the transfer of substantially all risks
and rewards with the involvement of structured entities, (b) the splitting of significant risks and rewards with
control remaining with us without the involvement of structured entities or (c) the splitting of significant risks
and rewards with control remaining with us and with the involvement of structured entities. As of September
30, 2021, our factoring facilities were of an amount of €240.0 million. See also “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangement—Factoring and Receivables Financing Facilities” and “Capitalization.”_

**Contractual Obligations**

Presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2021, after giving
effect to the Transactions. The below table only represents debt and similar liabilities, and, other than in the
case of lease liabilities, include only principal amounts of such debt and liabilities. For a full presentation of
our contractual obligations, see our Historical Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum, in particular, notes 12 to 15 in our Audited Financial Consolidated Financial Statements

Acquisition. The RCF is available until 77 months following the first utilization of the TLB. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.”_

(2)  Represents the split of the contractual amount of the lease liabilities of the Target Group, as of September 30, 2021. The carrying

amount of the lease liabilities pursuant to IFRS 16 on the Target Group’s consolidated statement of financial position data as of
September 30, 2021 is €760.7 million, which reflects lease liabilities measured at the present value of the future lease payments of
the contractual amount.

(3) Includes the contractual amount of the lease liabilities of the Target Group, as of September 30, 2021. Adjusting the contractual
amount of the lease liabilities of the Target Group to arrive at the carrying amount of the lease liabilities pursuant to IFRS 16 on the
Target Group’s consolidated statement of financial position data as of September 30, 2021, as described in note (2) above, our total
contractual obligations would be €4,528.4 million.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

We are exposed to the following risks related to the use of financial instruments:

    - market risk;

    - credit risk;

    - liquidity risk;

    - foreign currency risk; and


-----

    - interest rate risk.

Our supervisory and management boards of directors have overall responsibility for the establishment
and oversight of our risk management framework. Our risk management policies are designed to identify and
analyze the risks undertaken by us, define appropriate risk limits and controls, and monitor risks and the
adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market
conditions and in our activities. We, through our management standards and procedures, aim to develop a
disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

**_Market Risk_**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates or
indexation, could affect our income or the value of financial instruments held. The objective of market risk
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters. We face a low
market risk regarding our financial instruments. Our overall risk management program focuses on minimizing
uncertainty in financial markets and the potential adverse effects on our financial performance.

For further details on our market risk management, refer to note 32 in our Audited Financial
Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and note 9 in our Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to which we are exposed if a customer or counterparty to a
financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. This risk arises principally from receivables from
customers.

Our maximum exposure to credit risk for each class of financial assets, taking into account collateral
held and other loan collateral at the relevant reporting dates can be depicted as follows:

(1) Balances as of December 31, 2020 take bad debt allowances into account. For a consistent disclosure, trade receivables as of
December 31, 2019 were aligned by €59.6 million bad debt allowance for amortized costs (“AC”) and €12.4 million for fair value
through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”).

(2) Reclassification of €7.3 million from category “continuing involvement” to AC as of December 31, 2019, in order to provide for
more precise presentation and consistency with the balances as of December 31, 2020.

We have no significant concentrations of credit risk and maintain policies to ensure that sales are made
to customers with an adequate credit history. Our clients primarily consist of consumers and businesses with
low average balances which are regularly reviewed. When necessary, these consumers are disconnected from
service when no payment is received. Credit risk is taken into account through a combination of specific and
general valuation allowances.

We have policies to limit exposure to risks assumed in respect to customers and financial institutions,
exposure to risk of recovering receivables and loans is managed as part of our ordinary activities. We have
policies to ensure that sales of products on a wholesale basis are made to customers, including both B2B and
B2C customers, with an adequate credit history. Several debt collection agencies are commissioned to collect


-----

outstanding receivables and inform us about the status of doubtful debts. This valuation is done by the agencies
based on complex models taking various indications into account.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based
on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress
and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. We
have therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of
the loss rates for the contract assets.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 12 to 45 months,
depending on the segment, and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The
historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors
affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. Our maximum exposure to credit risk from fair
value at profit or loss at December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and September 30, 2021 is equal to the carrying
amounts. With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, we consider that there was no significant impact on our
credit risk and financial assets as of September 30, 2021.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet financial obligations as they fall due. Our
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that we will always have sufficient liquidity to
meet our liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses
or risking damage to our reputation.

We apply a prudent policy to cover our liquidity risks, based on maintaining sufficient cash and
marketable securities as well as the availability of sufficient financing through credit facilities to settle market
positions.

Our available cash and equivalents as of September 30, 2021, were €153.9 million, compared to €169.2
million as of December 31, 2020, €143.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and €293.0 million as of December
31, 2018. Net cash generated from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was
positive in the amount of €293.7 million, compared to a positive amount of €581.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, a positive amount of €429.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and a positive
amount of €394.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

With respect to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is foreseeable that the general situation of
the markets where we operate could lead to a general increase in liquidity tensions in the Dutch economy, as
well as a potential contraction in the credit market.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

For a discussion on our foreign currency risk, refer to note 32 in our Audited Financial Consolidated
Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

For a discussion on our interest rate risk, refer to note 32 in our Audited Financial Consolidated
Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and note 9 in our unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

**Significant Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements used when Applying Accounting**
**Principles**

Relevant accounting estimates and judgements and other estimates and assumptions have to be made
when applying our accounting principles to prepare the consolidated annual accounts in conformity with IFRS.

**INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW**


**Overview**

Within the Dutch telecommunications industry, we operate across two markets, providing both mobile
and fixed connectivity services to consumers and businesses. While we began as a mobile-only business, we
have now established ourselves as a challenger in the fixed connectivity services market, with fixed broadband
internet as our core fixed product, in addition to fixed telephony and television services. We are one of three
mobile network operators in The Netherlands, each of which holds a strong presence in the mobile and fixed
connectivity services markets. Other players in our industry include mobile virtual network operators
(“MVNO”) and infrastructure providers, such as independent tower companies. We operate in a dynamic
regulatory environment to which we must be continually responsive and innovative. Driven by organic and
inorganic growth, we are the largest mobile telecommunications provider in the Dutch consumer market by
mobile service revenue and number of SIMs, we have been ranked as the best mobile network in The
Netherlands for the fifth year in a row, and we have also been ranked as the top network in the world (Source:
_PresseBox, Five in a Row—T-Mobile Wins the Umlaut Connect Mobile Benchmark in The Netherlands Again;_
_PresseBox, T-Mobile Awarded “Best in Test” Worldwide by Umlaut )._


**Dutch Economy**

The Netherlands is the sixth largest economy in the European Union, with a gross domestic product
(“GDP”) of €800 billion in 2020 (source: Eurostat, October 2021), and the 10[th] most populated country in the
region, with an estimated population of 17.5 million inhabitants in 2020 (source: Eurostat, October 2021). In
2020, Dutch GDP declined by 3.8%, less than the European Union average of 6.0% (source: Eurostat) as a
result of the COVID-19-related lockdowns imposed by Dutch authorities. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
the Dutch economy consistently grew faster than the European Union average for the past four years. Dutch
GDP growth has been driven by a combination of factors, led by private consumption, investment and
international trade.

The Netherlands has been moderately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, timely fiscal
support and existing digital infrastructure reduced the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eighty percent of
the decrease in output caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020 was recouped towards the
end of 2020. This was mainly attributed to the resilience of manufacturing. Export of services in 2020 was 17%
lower than in 2019 (source: Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (“CPB”) (Centraal Planbureau)). Despite a
contraction of 3.7% of the Dutch economy during 2020, current economic analyses project a strong recovery.
The OECD estimates an annual growth rate of 3.5% in 2021, 3.0% in 2022 and 1.8% in 2023.

The Netherlands is the second largest exporter of goods and services within the European Union
_(source: Eurostat, October 2021)._ Agricultural production represents approximately 16% of total exports,
which makes the Dutch economy the second largest agricultural exporter in the world and the largest in Europe
(source: Eurostat).

Price growth in The Netherlands has remained low and relatively stable, with an annual inflation rate
of 1.1% in 2020, compared to 2.6% in 2019 (source: De Nederlandsche Bank (“DNB”), March 2021). The
decrease is mainly attributed to reduced consumption in 2020 caused by the containment measures that were
taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (source: OECD). The inflation rate is projected to increase to
1.5% over the course of 2021. This relatively stable increase is a result of higher oil prices on the one hand and
substantial adjustments to household expenditures on the other hand, with the impacts effectively cancelling
one another. Inflation is expected to rise to 2.2% in 2022 and 1.5% in 2023, in line with developments that
would be expected in economic recovery _(source: European Commission, November 2021)._ Dutch
unemployment rates have improved, declining from a peak of 7.4% in 2014 to a low of 3.4% in 2019 before
increasing to 3.8% in 2020, due to the fast implementation of policy support such as wage subsidies, deferred
tax expenses and loan guarantees for firms, but these rates remain low overall compared to other jurisdictions
(sources: OECD, World Bank).

The Netherlands has recovered from challenging macroeconomic conditions in the past, most recently
from the 2008 global financial crisis. Following a four-year period of economic growth from 2003 to 2007
_(source: World Bank), in 2008 The Netherlands entered a recession following the global economic slowdown_
at the time. Consequently, The Netherlands’ real GDP declined by 3.7% in 2009, with the unemployment rate
not peaking until 2014 at 7.4%. This decline was partially mitigated by a series of stimulus measures taken by
the Dutch government in 2008 and 2009 to stabilize the economy. The two stimulus plans, amounting to €6
billion and €13.754 billion respectively, aimed to bolster domestic sectors and improve social and
unemployment policies. The efforts translated into positive economic growth over the subsequent years,
however growth stagnated with a further recession in 2012, caused by low export growth and a decrease in
domestic spending (source: Statistics Netherlands (Central Bureau voor de Statistiek)).

**Dutch Telecommunications Market**

**_History and regulatory changes_**

As a result of liberalization initiatives of the telecommunications sector mandated by various European
Commission Directives and WTO commitments, the Dutch telecommunications market officially has moved
from a closed, restricted, and virtually monopolized sector to an open market structure in 1997.


-----

Prior to 1990, the Royal Dutch PTT (now known as KPN) held a monopoly position on the installation
of telecommunication networks and the provision of telecommunication services. Liberalization was gradually
imposed over the following seven years and after its privatization in 1989 and listing in 1994. In 1995, an
additional Global System for Mobile communication (“GSM”) license in the mobile segment was awarded to
Libertel (now known as VFZ). In 1996/1997, the liberalization of the fixed segment was initiated by opening
up fixed infrastructure. Two national licenses were awarded to Telfort and Enertel along with KPN as the
incumbent and about 1,400 regional infrastructure licenses were awarded to approximately 160 other
companies. In 1998, digital cellular system licenses at 1,800 MHz were awarded to Telfort,
Teledanmark/Proximus, which was launched as Ben and is now part of TMNL, and France
Telecommunications, which was launched as Federa and was bought by TMNL in 2007. These market
participants all expanded their product offerings, introduced new technologies and enhanced the
telecommunications market.

The Dutch telecommunications sector has experienced multiple instances of consolidation. In 2008,
three of the largest cable operators – Home, Casema and Multikabel – formed Ziggo, which eventually was
acquired by Liberty Global. Subsequently, Liberty Global formed in The Netherlands a joint venture with
Vodafone, creating the large national converged cable operator VFZ. A condition of the European
Commission’s regulatory approval of this joint venture was that Vodafone had to divest its Dutch fixed line
broadband business, Thuis, which was acquired by TMNL in December 2016. Deutsche Telekom Group
originally entered the Dutch telecommunications market through its acquisition of operator Ben Nederland
Holding B.V. in 2002 and Orange Nederland N.V., Orange Nederland Breedband B.V. in 2007, and later
acquired the Dutch operations of Swedish MNO Tele2 Sverige AB in January 2019. Today, TMNL, KPN and
VFZ are the major operators in the country.

Following the global financial crisis of 2009 and the takeover attempt by América Móvil of KPN in
2012, the Dutch government’s view on a fully open market changed slightly. The government made various
regulatory commitments to protect Dutch consumers and foster healthy competition. In 2011, The Netherlands
became the first European country to pass net neutrality legislation, preventing leading market operators from
charging consumers extra for certain data traffic. In 2019, the Dutch industry regulator, Netherlands Authority
for Consumers and Markets (“ACM”), through guidance detailed a framework to prevent bottlenecks in FTTHrollout, therein highlighting options such as joint investment and temporary protection at municipal level for
first movers. The objectives of consumer and technology protection for the vital telecommunications sector also
has resulted in a revised Telecommunication Sector Act, passed on May 19, 2020, with the purpose of further
protecting Dutch national security and public order. Under this reform, the Minister of Economic Affairs and
Climate must be notified if a party intention to acquire ‘a controlling interest’ in a ‘telecom party’ if such interest
results in ‘relevant influence’ in the Dutch telecommunications sector. If an acquisition leads to disproportionate
influence over Dutch national security and public order, the Minister can prohibit the transaction. Although
wholesale regulation which required operators to sign commercial agreements to gain access to KPN’s fixed
network was repealed in 2020, the Dutch telecommunications supervisory board (ACM) is considering whether
to reinforce the legislation after reviewing it this year.

**_Dutch Telecommunications Infrastructure_**

**_Mobile infrastructure market_**

The Dutch mobile telecommunications infrastructure ecosystem comprises three mobile network
operators (“MNO”) that own their networks, approximately 30 active mobile virtual network operators
(“MVNO”) as well as infrastructure companies. Many telecommunications operators and smaller tower
companies across The Netherlands are executing, or considering, tower network sales to other operators and
independent telecommunications infrastructure tower companies. The major independent tower company in
The Netherlands is Cellnex, which offers network as a service, allowing customers to operate their own
networks, without maintaining own passive network infrastructure, by paying a flat fee per site or a variable
cost per gigabyte (“GB”) consumed. Cellnex builds and maintains the distributed antenna system (“DAS”), to
which the MNOs connect. Cellnex entered the Dutch market in 2016 with its acquisition of Protelindo and
Shere Group in 2016, as well as Alticom in 2017. On September 1, 2018, TMNL carved out its tower business
by way of a legal demerger (juridische splitsing) to Cignal Infrastructure. As part of a later transaction, Cignal
Infrastructure was transferred to Cellnex Netherlands B.V. T-Mobile Netherlands maintains access to Cellnex’s


-----

passive infrastructure elements through a master services agreement. Cellnex now operates a total of 4,314 sites,
with 180 new sites to be rolled out in the next seven years. VFZ owns its portfolio of towers of approximately
3,000 sites.

The three MNOs – TMNL, KPN and VFZ – have been rolling out 4G technology since mid-2012 or
early 2013 and are collectively offering 4G coverage in 99% of the country in terms of both geography and
population. All three MNOs provide 5G services, following an early launch by VFZ in April 2020 with the help
of Ericsson’s dynamic spectrum sharing technology which enables 5G activation with existing frequency bands
on the 1,800 MHz band, KPN and TMNL launched their respective 5G services in July 2020, following the
first auction of 5G on the 700 MHz band. The auction covered 700 MHz, 1,400 MHz and 2,100 MHz bands
and raised a total of €1.23 billion. In terms of allocation of frequency rights between the dominant market
players, TMNL secured 70 MHz and KPN and VFZ 75 MHz each. All MNOs have since expanded their 5G
networks, with VFZ reporting in July 2020 that it had reached a population coverage of more than 80% on its
5G network. In October 2020, TMNL reported that its 5G mobile network reached 90% of the Dutch population,
making it the first MNO to provide nationwide 5G coverage. Finally, in April 2021, KPN estimated that their
5G network reached approximately 72% of the Dutch population. Further 5G services may be offered after the
auction in the latter half of 2022 of the 3.5 GHz band, which is currently used by the Dutch government for
intelligence communications and by a satellite telecommunications company for safety communications at sea.

**_Overview of Dutch spectrum allocation_**

_Note: Based on used frequencies only, excluding guard bands. 10 MHz has been excluded for TMNL and KPN, respectively, on the 2,600_
_MHz band as this represents unused frequencies. VFZ currently offers 5G on the 1,800 MHz band, using DSS. Based on 2020 mobile SIMs_
_(postpaid, prepaid and B2B), TMNL including Tele2 and Simpel._

**_Fixed infrastructure market_**

The Netherlands has one of the highest fixed broadband penetrations in Europe, with 97% of all
households having internet in 2020 (source: Eurostat). DSL, hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) and fiber networks
compete on a cross-platform basis. Fixed broadband connections have increased by 13.3% between 2013 and
2020 and fiber connections have increased by more than a factor of three over the same period. HFC connections
increased by 12.9% and DSL decreased by 19.7% (source: ACM Monitor; Publicly available sources). DSL
connections are falling as consumers move to next-generation networks (“NGN”), namely fiber to the home
(“FTTH”) or HFC, which are able to deliver higher speed and quality. In 2020, about 49% of the fixed


-----

broadband connections provided households with data above 100 Mb/s (source: ACM). This number has
continuously increased over the years due to new technologies and infrastructure as well as increased consumer
demand, not least during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. FTTH and HFC have become the main focus
for Dutch operators in recent years, as demonstrated by the extensive rollout of fiber optic network. The
Netherlands has taken a collaborative approach with municipalities when building out fiber networks. As a
result of operators partaking in the rollout of NGN networks and phasing out copper networks, the number of
FTTH networks installed grew from 517,000 to almost 1,600,000 in 2020, representing an increase of 206%
(source: ACM Monitor).

As of 2020, the number of households passed with FTTH amounted to approximately 3.67 million,
representing approximately 46% of all households in The Netherlands (source: ACM Monitor). Approximately
3.33 million of the houses passed are on the KPN and DELTA Fiber Nederland B.V. (“DELTA Fiber”)
network.

The fixed infrastructure market has followed a similar monetization path as the mobile infrastructure
market, and several commercial wholesale agreements over fiber networks have been reached in recent years.
Operators have been either divesting their FTTH networks or creating strategic partnerships with companies
such as Open Dutch Fiber (“ODF”) or DELTA Fiber Nederland B.V., backed by financial sponsors KKR &
Co. Inc. (“KKR”) with Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners Management GmbH (“DTCP”) and EQT Partners
(“EQT”), respectively. In April 2021, KKR and DTCP launched a fiber venture with TMNL as the anchor
tenant, in which capital expenditure commitments will amount to approximately €700 million (source: publicly
_announced by KKR and DTCP). Similarly, one of EQT’s infrastructure funds and Stonepeak recently_
announced their joint acquisition of DELTA Fiber. Another example is KPN and pension fund APG’s joint
venture, Glaspoort, a partnership that is aimed to rollout fiber to approximately 750,000 homes and 225,000
businesses in the upcoming five years. The investment is expected to amount to over €1 billion.

The fixed broadband sector also has been backed by significant investment in fiber infrastructure, as
seen in the FTTH household penetration of approximately 20% in 2020, compared to 7% in 2013. There is,
however room for growth, as fiber connections in The Netherlands represented only 21% of total broadband
connections in 2020, compared to the OECD average of 31%. The Netherlands ranks 26[th] among all 38 OECD
countries in terms of percentage of fiber connections amongst total broadband connections.

**_Dutch telecommunications market_**

The Dutch telecommunications market is one of the largest in Europe, supported by The Netherlands
being the sixth largest economy in the European Union (source: Eurostat, October 2021) and a population of
more than 17.5 million (source: Eurostat, January 2021). The market landscape is led by the three MNO
players: KPN, TMNL and VFZ. Mobile penetration is 128% as of the fourth quarter of 2020 (source: ACM
_Monitor), which is above the European Union average of 122% (source: World Bank). Consistent with global_
consumption trends, demand for data has increased significantly in The Netherlands, translating to a
compounded annual growth of approximately 61% since 2013 and until the end of 2020. TMNL currently
carries more than 50% of this data (source: ACM Monitor) and a vast majority of this data is based on 4G
(LTE), the network for which currently reaches over 99% of the country by both geography and population.
Consequently, the Dutch operators are increasingly focusing on services based on 5G.

In 2020, mobile cellular subscriptions in The Netherlands amounted to 22.3 million subscriptions
_(source: ACM Monitor), compared to 19.5 million in 2013, with broadband communications lines increasing_
from 6.7 million in 2013 to 7.5 million in 2020 (source: ACM Monitor). Penetration continues to improve, with
mobile telephony and fixed broadband penetration reaching 127.9% (population) and 94.1% (households),
respectively, in each case as of the fourth quarter of 2020.

_(1) Includes both B2B and B2C._

There are positive trends that impact the mobile B2C segment. The continued increase of the
population, with younger generations having phones at a younger age and the pre-to-post migration impact the
number of SIM subscriptions. The current trend towards multi-SIM, meaning the ability for consumers to
connect multiple devices to the same mobile number, allows for more flexible voice services and increased
customer loyalty. KPN and TMNL offer multi-SIM solutions today. Average revenue per user (“ARPUs”) of
the market are according to management’s estimates expected to grow, mainly through the increased access of
5G, “more for more” services and low-end portfolio optimization.

Within the fixed market, consumer demand for data at a higher speed is increasing and the willingness
to pay more for ultrafast fiber and better quality is becoming increasingly important to consumers. We believe
that this growing demand for broadband services is likely to offset the decline of segments such as traditional
TV and fixed voice, which are increasingly being replaced by more digital solutions such as over the top
(“OTT”) communication services that operate over the internet.

**_Dutch Mobile Market_**

**_Focus on the Dutch mobile telephony market_**

The Dutch mobile telephony market is led by the three MNOs – KPN, TMNL and VFZ – which
directly provide services to consumers mainly through their group brands, with KPN offering sub-brands such
as Simyo, and TMNL offering Tele2, Simpel or Ben as an alternative to the premium brand T-Mobile. MVNOs
hosted on MNO’s networks also provide consumers with mobile telephony services. As of December 31, 2020,
TMNL was the premier company in the B2C mobile market with a 42% market share as calculated by our
number of postpaid SIM subscribers, as compared to a 30% market share for KPN and 25% for VFZ in the
same market.

KPN phased out its Telfort brand between 2019 and 2020 in order to focus on value-over-volume
strategy in which the company wants to leverage a simplified product portfolio. TMNL’s growth has been
driven partly by the completion of the merger with the Dutch operations of Swedish Tele2 Sverige AB in 2019
and the acquisition of Simpel, a Dutch SIM-only MVNO, in 2020. Despite increased competition in the last
decade, the market has stabilized and prices have shown moderate growth across the MNOs.

Recent trends have shown increasing demand for mobile telephony lines in The Netherlands, with 22.3
million lines in 2020, an increase of 14.4% since 2013 (source: ACM Monitor). The postpaid segment is the
main driver of growth, with 5.9 million new lines since 2013, representing 90.4% of the MNO mobile services
market in 2020, while prepaid services decreased by 3.1 million over the same period. TMNL is achieving the
greatest increase of its postpaid customer base and has the highest share of net new customers compared to its
peers. This is mainly attributed to recent merger and acquisition activity, such as the merger with Tele2 in 2019
and the acquisition of Simpel in 2020.

The mobile telecommunications market in The Netherlands is relatively sizeable and attractive with
three MNOs and the risk of new MNOs and MVNOs entering the market is limited. For MNOs, low prices act
as a deterrent as ARPUs are at the low end of European benchmarks and significantly below the level at which
Tele2 unsuccessfully entered the market in 2015. Furthermore, there is no upcoming spectrum auction that


-----

could facilitate a new entrant – the upcoming auction for the 3.5 GHz spectrum is inappropriate for new entrants
due to propagation characteristics – and the market is highly converged, resulting in more lasting customers
and limiting the pool of available subscribers. The number of MVNOs has halved in the last six years from
approximately 60 to approximately 30 and the remaining MVNOs are small and focused on niche customer
groups.

_reported quarterly year-over-year growth percentages and (2) TMNL data includes Tele2 but excludes Simpel._

_Source: Publicly available sources/Management estimates._

The three players in the market have seen relatively stable ARPUs in recent quarters. KPN has
delivered stable ARPUs for the B2C mobile postpaid category, with ARPUs ranging between €17.3-18.3 since
the first quarter of 2019 (source: Public filings). KPN is devoting resources to its value-over-volume strategy
by refocusing on the KPN brand and phasing out its Telfort brand, in 2019, aiming to leverage its market
position as a trusted and conventional MNO and offer a simplified product portfolio. Historically, VFZ’s
ARPUs declined in a push to grow FMC penetration as a competitive response to TMNL’s lower prices. ARPUs
have recently started to stabilize, given the high FMC share reached and the changed competitive environment.
In recent reporting periods, all brands have experienced ARPU increases and reduced aggressive promotions.
Further growth within the Dutch mobile telephony market is supported by structural drivers such as the increase
in number of SIMs due to population growth. The continued pre- to post-migration trend, the growth of
Unlimited, 5G, value-added services and overall inflation are other drivers that are expected to support ARPUs.

**_Focus on the Dutch mobile broadband market_**

Mobile broadband is wireless internet access that is delivered through cellular towers. Although
representing a relatively small fraction of mobile connections in The Netherlands, the mobile broadband market
has gained traction through mobile network operator investments in high-speed package (“HSPA”) and LTE
technologies. An increase in the number of subscribers of mobile broadband is expected with the upcoming
auction of 3.5 GHz band in 2022, as 5G will enhance the range and capacity of networks.

**Dutch Broadband and Fixed Telephony Market**

**_Focus on fixed broadband market_**

Active fixed network broadband lines reached 7.5 million households in 2020, a modest increase of
0.9% compared to 2019 (source: ACM Monitor). Expansion of fixed broadband is mainly driven by growth of
installed fiber networks, which grew by 16.1% between 2019 and 2020 and resulted in a penetration of 42%.
This number has been increasing by the month, and as of June 2021 fiber penetrated 51% of Dutch households.


-----

_Broadband by technology (in millions of lines)_

_Source: ACM Monitor_

The growing number of broadband lines is partially driven by bundled offerings, the prevalence of
which has increased and most notably for 4P bundles (fixed-mobile). In 2020, 4P bundles took up 26% of total
broadband connections – compared to 7% in 2014. Bundled offerings accounted for 92% of all retail
connections with broadband in 2020 (source: ACM Monitor).

Over the course of 2020, average fixed broadband speed increased because of higher network access
and greater sales of bundles with higher fixed line connection speeds and larger mobile connection traffic
volumes. As of 2020, 99% of broadband lines had a connection speed higher than 10 Mbps. In 2019, lines with
a connection speed greater than 30 Mbps but less than 100 Mbps amounted to 46% and decreased to 44% in
2020. However, this decrease was offset by an increase of lines with a connection speed of 100 Mbps or higher,
which increased from 46% of retail connections in 2019 to 49% in 2020 (source: ACM Monitor). Collectively,
lines with a speed of 30 Mbps or more amounted to 91.7%. While lines with connection speeds greater than
100 Mbps increased in 2020, this was mainly reflected in high-speed data processed via fiber-optic connections,
representing a 30.1% increase, whereas DSL and cable connections increased by 0.9% and 1.3% respectively.
This demonstrates the proportionate relationship between the number of high data subscribers and upgrades of
network infrastructure and technology.

Two of the three largest MNOs, VFZ and KPN, hold key positions in the market for fixed broadband
retail connections, with a revenue market share of 45% and 41% respectively, with TMNL currently holding a
6% share.

Fixed-mobile convergence has been one of the key themes in the market over the past years. As such,
a viable FMC product, which currently only can be offered by the three large MNOs, is a prerequisite to
participate at large scale in both the fixed and mobile markets.

**_Focus on fixed telephony_**

Fixed telephony revenue continued to decline during 2020 and so did both public switched telephone
networks (“PSTN”) and voice over broadband (“VOB”) single connections. Although fixed telephony is
considered a mature, declining market, the operators benefit from the service by bundling it with other
telecommunications services. In 2020, only 17% of fixed telephony retail connections were contracted
individually. The remaining 37% was in 4P bundles, 40% in 3P bundles and 6% in 2P bundles.

In 2020, the network traffic per fixed line decreased by 30.9% whereas broadband network traffic
increased by 14.7%. The majority of consumers have replaced their fixed telephones with mobiles and most
digital interactions now take place either online or via mobile networks. As a result of the shift from fixed to
mobile telephony, fixed telephony revenues have decreased by 71% since 2013.

_Revenue fixed network (in € million)_

**_Bundling/fixed-mobile convergence_**

By bundling services together, such as high speed data packages and phone services, rather than
offering discounted prices separately, both consumers and operators can potentially achieve better value. FMC
can be driven by consumer demand and by operators seizing opportunities and locking in customers, leveraging
either a fixed or a mobile asset that competitors may not have.

_Product bundles penetration (% of total subscribers)_

_Source: ACM Monitor_

The Dutch telecommunications market has shifted over recent years. The number of fixed-mobile
product bundles (4P, 3P and 2P bundles) has increased every year from an aggregate of 5.6 million in 2013 to
7.0 million in 2020, with penetration of fixed-mobile product bundles increasing from 4.9% to 36.6% over this
period. There has been a steady increase in the popularity of 4P bundles, growing each year from approximately
0.4 million in 2013 to 2.9 million in 2020. Meanwhile, 3P bundle subscriptions increased from 3.5 million in
2013 to 3.9 million in 2016, before falling back to 2 million in 2020 as 4P bundles grew in popularity.
Consumers with 2P bundle subscriptions have increased from 1.7 million in 2013 to 2.1 million in 2020 (source:
_ACM Monitor). In 2020, TMNL held a 5-10% retail market share of bundled services. VFZ held a 45-50%_
market share, while KPN and DELTA Fiber held 35-40% and 5-10% market share, respectively. DELTA Fiber
does not offer retail bundles containing mobile (source: ACM Monitor).

FMC will be further enabled by cross-selling a large mobile base and through the upselling of fixed
services to mobile customers, which will spur growth in the consumer market. In 2021, TMNL’s brand Tele2
launched various FMC multi-brand offerings that are aimed to improve loyalty, both by serving the existing
customer base and by establishing brands that cater to new customers within the whole household.

**Pay-TV**

Although demand for traditional television is gradually reducing as consumers move to alternative
media services, such as OTT services, television via fiber is gaining prominence. Between 2013 and 2020, fiber
connections for television in The Netherlands increased by a factor of 1.7x _(source: ACM Monitor). Fiber_
provides customers with good quality picture while simultaneously allowing operators to reduce operating costs
in the long run.

_Television subscriptions per connection type (in millions of lines)_

_Source: ACM Monitor_

The rapid growth of OTT streaming services, both advertisement-based video on demand (“AVOD”)
and subscription-based video on demand (“SVOD”), has impacted traditional pay-TV operators that use
satellite and cable to offer subscription television services. As KPN launched its IPTV package as part of its
convergence strategy and eventually launched 4P bundles, competitors had to act accordingly and improve their
own convergence service offerings. Despite VFZ’s leading position in the market, the company now offers
Netflix on all of its set-top boxes. In 2015, KPN launched KPN Play, which eventually was discontinued in
2018 due to a lack of demand. TMNL subsequently closed its own OTT offering, Knippr, the same year.
Nevertheless, in 2020 The Netherlands had the third highest percentage of its national population streaming
internet TV or videos compared to 37 other European countries, due to significant growth of companies offering
streaming media as a core service. In 2020, 95% of the Dutch population who used the internet within the last
three months used it to watch internet-streamed TV or videos, compared to 90% and 84% in 2018 and 2016,
respectively (source: Eurostat).

The Dutch government and network operators also have responded to the change in media
consumption partially by freeing up spectrum space. KPN upgraded its terrestrial television service, digitenne,
to the digital video broadcasting – second generational terrestrial (DVB-T2) standard to free up 700 MHz for
mobile traffic. Similarly, in April 2021 VFZ finalized its process of turning off its analogue cable television so
that capacity for broadband could be increased.


-----

**Business & wholesale market**

The B2B mobile market has declined in the last three years, mainly due to changes in what type of
telecommunications services businesses require for their operations. One factor contributing to the negative
trend in voice is the transition from traditional telephony to integrated solutions (e.g., Cloud PBX solutions that
provide telephone server access over a cloud-based internet network).

_Source: Publicly available sources/Management estimates._

The decline of the fixed market is partially a result of the transformation from legacy (copper, PSTN/
ISDN) to new IP services (fiber-based). Although the B2B fixed market is going through a transformation as
voice declines, this is offset by the growth of data and broadband, and management expects stabilization with
growing revenues in the market. KPN holds a leading position that it leverages by locking in business customers
with unified communications solutions that integrate various communication services, such as instant
messaging, voice, and video conferencing. VFZ historically has been focusing on small to mid-size enterprise
customers, which is a current growth segment. TMNL plans to expand its B2B services by launching
broadband/FMC products and to mirror its success in the B2C market.

Wholesale business fiber connections in The Netherlands amounted to approximately 107,000
connections, growing from 100,000 in 2019 (source: ACM Monitor). The fixed connectivity segment is mainly
driven by demand for internet and data networks, which in turn is fueled by the shift from cable to fiber.

Pursuant to regulatory refinements, KPN and VFZ are no longer required to maintain a wholesale offer
for virtual access to their networks. Since 1997, KPN was obligated to provide wholesale access to its copper
and fiber network, and since October 2018 VFZ was obligated to provide wholesale access to its cable network.
In a landmark decision in March 2020, the regulator (ACM) found that KPN and VFZ together held significant
market power. However, after a national appeal, this decision was annulled by the CBb in March 2020. The
court held that there was not sufficient evidence to establish joint dominance on the retail market by KPN and
VFZ. As a result, these companies are no longer obligated to provide wholesale access to their networks,
although KPN has chosen to continue to offer wholesale access of both copper and fiber to other operators.

**Regulatory outlook**

The main regulatory bodies in the Dutch telecommunications market include ACM and supervisory
authorities: the Radiocommunications Agency Netherlands (Agentschap Telecom) (“AT”), which is part of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy; the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit
_Financiële Markten) (“AFM”); and the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) (“AP”)._

There are differing views on how deregulation will impact competition and pricing for fixed wholesale
access. TMNL relies on access to KPN’s networks but recently submitted two requests to ACM to have KPN
regulated again and enforce wholesale access against regulated wholesale tariffs (source: Company
_information). Despite wholesale access no longer being regulated at this time, ACM has been granted a new_
regulatory tool (symmetric access) to impose access obligations, in addition to the market analysis route it has
had for decades. A draft market analysis decision of the ACM is expected to be published towards the end of
2021, following its press release in July 2021, that it will conduct research and take a decision on the need (and


-----

if so, the way) to regulate fixed access. According to this press release, the ACM sees a risk that KPN may
restrict its access conditions.

In February 2021, the Dutch Minister of Finance sent a letter to the Dutch Parliament reflecting an
intention to revise consumer credit regulation in The Netherlands by lowering the threshold for document
verification required to obtain a loan for a mobile device. So far, no legislative proposal has been submitted to
Parliament to execute this intention and a decision has not been made whether to submit such a proposal. With
regards to data roaming, there will potentially be stricter quality of service provisions as EU bodies are in a
process of reviewing roaming regulations including a potential reduction of the wholesale and/or retail tariffs
in the future. In April 2021, Dutch mobile operators received a decision from the Dutch government on the
basis of which Chinese vendors are restricted from supplying specific components to the core mobile network
and service platforms of Dutch telecom providers. The Dutch MNOs are granted a transition period to replace
the current equipment and the transition period is in line with TMNL’s usual replacement and rotation cycle.

The auction of the 3.5 GHz is expected to take place in the latter half of 2022, but this could be delayed
to 2023 due to a court case initiated by Inmarsat, a British satellite telecommunications company, which
currently uses the spectrum for safety communications at sea. There are not expected to be significant regulatory
challenges in connection with spectrum coverage.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

Operating under the T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel brands, we are one of the three mobile network
operators (“MNOs”) in the Dutch telecommunications market. We offer mobile (both postpaid and prepaid)
and fixed telecommunications services to both B2C and B2B customers, and we also sell handsets to our
customers. We are the largest mobile telecommunications provider in the Dutch consumer market by mobile
service revenue and number of SIMs, we have been ranked as the best mobile network in The Netherlands for
the fifth year in a row, and we have also been ranked as the top network in the world (Source: Umlaut, The
_2021 Mobile Network Test in The Netherlands; PresseBox, T-Mobile Awarded “Best in Test” Worldwide by_
_Umlaut)._

As of September 30, 2021, we had 6.9 million mobile subscribers and 0.7 million fixed subscribers, representing
an increase of approximately 29% and 24%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2018. For the twelve
months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions and other adjustments, our combined mobile
service revenues totaled €1,215.1 million, our combined fixed line services revenue totaled €391 million, and
our revenue from the sale of goods and services, and other revenues totaled €443 million. Mobile service
revenue combines mobile revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as visitor roaming, and our fixed
line services revenue combines fixed line revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as fixed line
wholesale revenue. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions and other
adjustments, our revenue for the B2C segment totaled €1,239 million and for the B2B segment was €292
million. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was €637.4
million.

TMNL traces its origins back to 2002, when Deutsche Telekom entered the Dutch market through the
acquisition of Ben, which it subsequently rebranded as T-Mobile in 2003. In 2007, we acquired Orange
Netherlands, making us the third largest mobile operator in The Netherlands after Koninklijke KPN N.V.
(“KPN”) and VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V. (“VFZ”). In 2016, we acquired Vodafone’s fixed business,
Vodafone Thuis, which was subsequently renamed to TMNL Thuis. This transaction marked our entry into the
fixed market, adding approximately 150,000 fixed line customers. Through the TMNL Thuis acquisition, we
also gained access to a dark fiber footprint on KPN’s fiber network (KPN ODF). In January 2019, we completed
the acquisition of Tele2, strengthening our position in the Dutch market, across all segments. In December
2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, an online-only SIM-only MVNO on our network, focusing in
particular on the low budget segment of the market. The Simpel acquisition further strengthened our position,
making us the leader both in terms of B2C mobile postpaid SIM cards and service revenues. We continue to
operate the Simpel brand after its acquisition in 2020. In April 2021, we announced a strategic partnership with
Open Dutch Fiber, a company owned by KKR and DTCP that plans to roll-out fiber services to over one million
homes passed. We are the anchor tenant on this network which focuses on dense, urban areas in which we
currently have a large mobile market share. The Open Dutch Fiber partnership is an example of our asset-light
model and lean operational setup, which we believe enables us to streamline our business and optimize our
indirect cost base ratio.

We provide our B2C customers with a multi-brand portfolio of mobile services, including voice,
messaging and broadband aiming to cover all segments of the market from premium to low-budget and
operating on our own networks of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G spectra. Through T-Mobile Thuis, we offer nationwide
fixed broadband, TV and fixed voice services with FTTH and xDSL (copper) technologies. In addition, and in
line with market trends, we offer B2C customers packages that bundle mobile and fixed telecommunications
services at attractive prices, known as FMC packages. Our B2B business segment is dedicated to meeting the
connectivity needs of companies of all types and sizes as we offer a broad range of telecommunications
solutions, cloud-based and unified communications solutions. The chart below sets forth key events in our
growth and transformation to the largest mobile telecommunications provider in The Netherlands’ B2C market
and an established mobile-led FMC challenger.


-----

We have invested heavily in our offerings and we believe we have successfully repositioned our
business through innovation and change, as evidenced by our new offerings and services and by our being the
first provider to offer nationwide 5G coverage on the 700 MHz band. Going forward, we believe we are uniquely
positioned to capitalize on further growth opportunities, enabling us to continue on our historical trajectory and
set new industry standards. The chart below highlights some of our key successes between 2015 and 2020.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Attractive telecommunications market structure in The Netherlands_**

We operate in The Netherlands, which has a sizeable and attractive telecommunications market which
consists of three main telecommunications providers. The Netherlands is the 6[th ]largest economy in Europe and
has a robust macroeconomic environment, with 2% real GDP growth expected for 2021, moderate population
and household growth, and a large demand for high-quality communication services (Source: Telecompaper).
We compete in both the mobile and the fixed markets with KPN and VFZ. We are the premier company in the
B2C mobile market with a 42% market share as calculated by our number of postpaid SIM subscribers, as
compared to a 30% market share for KPN and 25% for VFZ in the same market. The MVNO market is small
accounting for approximately 4% market share of postpaid SIMs, with the largest MVNO, Youfone, having an
approximately 3% market share based on number of SIM subscribers. In this context, we believe the risk of
irrational behaviors by existing competitors is low and that existing MNOs are likely to compete primarily on
the quality of their services. Following our acquisition of Tele2, the market players were further consolidated


-----

from four to three and a process of revenue and ARPU stabilization started, similar to what has been seen in
other markets such as Austria, Germany or Ireland. The Netherlands has one of the lowest ARPU levels in
Europe.

We also believe that the risk of a new MNO entering the market is low. We believe that this is due to
the following factors: (i) the highly converged nature of the market, making it less attractive for new entrants,
as they must be able to offer both mobile and fixed offers to be competitive therein and (ii) the lack of any
viable spectrum auction that could allow the entrance of a new player, since the upcoming 5G spectrum auction
in The Netherlands is planned to offer only a specific band of spectrum and we do not need to renew our existing
spectrum licenses until 2030, making the auction more suitable for existing MNOs and unsuitable for new
entrants. The most recent possibility for a new entrant to obtain a marketable spectrum allocation would have
been the 2020 multi-band spectrum auction. However, only the three main players in the telecommunications
market, namely KPN, VFZ and us, participated in the auction. Additionally, we believe that the competitive
risk posed by MVNOs is low because MVNOs have limited ability to compete on unlimited subscriptions in
light of each MVNO’s lack of owned network and their limited ability to cover FMC packages, as well as such
unlimited plans’ impact on costs. Indeed, the number of MVNOs has decreased by half from approximately 60
to approximately 30 in The Netherlands over the last six years.

Furthermore, we anticipate that the B2C mobile market will continue to grow as data traffic continues
to increase. Indeed, our B2C mobile pro forma service revenues grew by 3.1% in 2020 (after a 4.1% decrease
in 2019) despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Key trends include:

(i) Growth in postpaid SIMs subscriptions, which is driven both by prepaid to postpaid subscription

migration and by population growth, as well as trends of increasing proportions of multi-SIM
subscriptions; and

(ii) Growth in mobile ARPU as driven by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services, value-added

services as well as overall inflation and the telecommunications market’s shift towards larger data
bundles. We believe that B2C ARPU will grow in the future due to these factors, even though
mobile ARPUs had decreased in The Netherlands in past years because of intense price
competition and mobile discounting as part of FMC offers, mainly triggered by KPN and VFZ.

The following table sets out historical trends in B2C mobile services ARPU across our brands and our
two major competitors, KPN and VFZ, and demonstrates that while ARPU among our competitors has generally
decreased in recent years, ARPU among our brands has generally increased or stabilized.


-----

_Source: Company information and publicly available information adjusted based on management estimates._

The B2B market has seen similar developments. In particular, ARPU in the SOHO/VSE segment
follows consumer market trends, driven as in the B2C market by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services
and value-added services, and we believe those drivers will continue to push ARPU growth. In the B2B market
generally, we believe that growth in subscribers will be driven by growth in SOHO/VSE businesses, an
increased adoption of mobile services in the B2B market and an increasing adoption of converged
telecommunications solutions.

Additionally, the Dutch fixed telecommunications market has benefitted from infrastructure upgrades
in recent years that have contributed to a growing market, in spite of declining telephony and peaking TV,
primarily due to a higher demand for broadband services at higher speeds, which is our core product offering
within the fixed segment. Historically, the fixed internet market in The Netherlands was dominated by KPN
and VFZ, which have a combined market share of approximately 80%. We have positioned ourselves as a
challenger in this market, focusing on providing fast broadband services and offering competitive and
sustainable pricing. In the future, we believe that growth in the fixed market will be driven by (i) an increase in
subscribers associated with household growth and (ii) premium customers’ willingness to pay for ultrafast fiber
and better quality, which allows for more-for-more strategies and results in increasing demand for higher fiberbased data bundles.

FTTH coverage is expanding in The Netherlands and the B2C and B2B markets are expected to benefit
from such expansion. We expect to benefit from this trend through what we call our ‘Magenta’ footprint, which
includes several Optical Distribution Framework-type of agreements and partnerships with, among others, Open
Dutch Fiber, KPN’s affiliate Reggefiber Operator B.V. and Primevest Capital Partners, where we expect to
eventually have access to over three million households at sustainable commercial terms. The remaining
households can be reached by Wholesale Broadband Access (“WBA”)-type of access on KPN copper (until its
planned phase-out over the next three years) and/or fiber network. Additional infrastructure players of


-----

significant size include Delta Fiber, Glaspoort (a joint venture between KPN and APG Groep N.V.) and
Eurofiber.

**_World-class network and strong commercial execution_**

We lead our competitors across a number of key attributes, including our world-class mobile network
with the largest spectrum portfolio in The Netherlands, our leading brand portfolio and our strong commercial
execution.

In December 2020, Umlaut ranked us the best mobile network in The Netherlands for the fifth year in
a row, and in February 2021, they recognized us as the top network in the world (Sources: PresseBox, Five in
_a Row—T-Mobile Wins the Umlaut Connect Mobile Benchmark in The Netherlands Again; PresseBox, T-_
_Mobile Awarded “Best in Test” Worldwide by Umlaut). According to the ACM, our mobile network carries_
approximately 50% of mobile data traffic in The Netherlands. We believe that our leading network position
results from our efficiently leveraging three key pillars: (i) technology, such as single radio access network
(“RAN”) with future-proof site configurations that are regularly upgraded in anticipation of customer demand;
(ii) sites, as we operate an optimal site grid with the highest site density in urban areas and 4,982 base stations
in total, providing coverage to more than 99% of the population of The Netherlands; (iii) the largest mobile
spectrum portfolio in The Netherlands with interference-free low bands, resulting in high cost efficiency and
an indoor capacity advantage. As of December 31, 2020, we held an aggregate of 250 MHz of spectrum, in
comparison with 215 MHz for VFZ and 195 MHz for KPN. None of the licenses in our portfolio need to be
renewed before 2030.

We have distinguished ourselves by our distinctive brand portfolio. In line with other MNOs in The
Netherlands, we have been following value-based and more-for-more strategies that target different market
segments with separate brands. Each of our four brands has a distinctive positioning with differentiated profiles,
as summarized in the following chart.

Our strong commercial execution is supported by our multiple sales channels and highly optimized
distribution network. We complement our in-store retail sales channel with an indirect sales channel that
deploys more than 500 extra partner stores that we regard as vital to boost physical sales. On top of our brickand-mortar network, webshops for T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel serve as efficient and growing online
channels that are instrumental for the sales of the whole brand portfolio. Our direct and indirect online channels
accounted for more than 60% of our B2C sales in 2020, which we regard as proof of our established and
effective digital presence. Furthermore, customer service for Ben and T-Mobile has been voted the best in the


-----

Dutch telecommunications industry in 2021 as determined by a customer survey (Source: MarketResponse
_customer survey). The quality of our customer service both in our physical locations and through our online_
presence has resulted both in continuous improvement of customer satisfaction and generation of FMC leads.

The following chart summarizes key indicators of our status as the leading telecommunications
operator in The Netherlands.

**_Well-positioned to benefit from market tailwinds for growth in market share, B2C revenue, customer_**
**_satisfaction and ARPU_**

Our status as a leading B2C mobile operator is confirmed by our market share as measured by our
volume of subscribers and by our revenue. As of December 31, 2020, we have 42% of the B2C mobile postpaid
market share by volume, which corresponds to 5.1 million SIMs. We have managed to reach our leading volume
market share of 42% over the past three years, supported in part by the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, while
the absolute number of subscribers grew at a CAGR of 4.5% between 2018 and 2020. At the same time, our
market share by revenue increased from 33% to 40% over the same period.

Our B2C mobile revenue growth in the past three years was mainly driven by stable ARPUs at brand
levels and a growing subscriber base, driven by marketing strategies for our brands, our strong positioning in
unlimited bundles on T-Mobile and Tele2, and an increase in demand for cheaper bundles with Ben and Simpel.

We have also maintained growth in customer satisfaction, which has helped us retain customers. In
the B2C mobile market, TMNL outpaced its competitors in The Netherlands by delivering the fastest-increasing
customer satisfaction TRI*M score over the last decade. TRI*M is a customer satisfaction metric widely
adopted within the Deutsche Telekom Group which combines customer recommendation, customer likelihood
to continue services, competitive advantage and performance. Our TRI*M score increased by over 50% over
12 years. We believe that an increase in customer satisfaction was one of the key factors driving the reduction
in our B2C mobile churn to approximately 11% in 2020.

We believe that our position as a leading B2C mobile operator with growing customer satisfaction
metrics situates us well to take advantage of trends towards converged fixed and mobile offerings and morefor-more strategies, as it allows us a larger base of customers to cross-sell into FMC packages and to upsell into
more premium offers. See “—World-class network and strong commercial execution” and “Industry—Dutch
_Broadband and Fixed Telephony Market—Focus on fixed broadband market.” Already in the first three quarters_
of 2021, our ARPU has grown across all four of our brands, corresponding to increases of between €0.8 and


-----

€1.1 in the third quarter of 2021 in comparison with the first quarter of 2021. We expect to experience moderate
growth in the future by building on our success in growing subscriber base and potential further ARPU growth.

**_High operational efficiency and an asset-light fixed model_**

We have a successful track record of M&A, synergy realization and cost optimization. This track
record, combined with a lean, asset-light fixed business model has given us operating leverage and operational
efficiency.

In 2016, we acquired Vodafone’s B2C fixed business, Vodafone Thuis, which we shortly thereafter
rebranded T-Mobile Thuis. Vodafone’s divestiture of Vodafone Thuis was ordered by the European
Commission as a remedy to provide competition clearance for VFZ, the joint venture between Vodafone and
Ziggo. This acquisition marked the beginning of our present fixed internet business and added about 150,000
fixed-line customers. In January 2019, we completed our acquisition of Tele2. This acquisition has strengthened
our position in the Dutch telecommunications market and allowed us to compete more effectively with KPN
and VFZ by giving us enhanced scale, combined spectrum resources and significant synergy potential. We are
executing a three-year plan to realize synergies from our acquisition of Tele2 in 2019. We have closed Tele2’s
standalone stores and we are in the process of implementing significant operations costs savings. Based on our
estimates, we anticipate realizing Tele2 cost-saving synergies with a total run-rate synergy potential of €130
million by 2024, of which we have already realized €115 million of synergies run-rate as of September 30,
2021. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, by then the largest MVNO in The
Netherlands. By means of this transaction, we acquired one million additional B2C mobile postpaid customers
who were already using our network under Simpel’s prior wholesale agreement with us. The acquisition of
Simpel provide further synergy and cost savings potential to be realized in the total amount of approximately
€9 million by 2024. Synergies related to Tele2 and Simpel entail for example related to reduced interconnect
costs, migration of Tele2’s business support system (“BSS”) to our Magenta stack, synergies in respect of bad
debt collections (representing improved client acceptance and collection practices implemented upon
integration with TMNL), direct and indirect cost savings related to the discontinuance of the Tele2 network and
the cancellation of leased telecommunications towers, reduction in marketing expenses as a result of mobile
cross-selling, optimization of campaigning periods, reduction in other indirect costs such as personnel related
costs as well as legal audit and tax fees. For risks related to our growth through acquisitions, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks,_
_including the risk that we may not be able to integrate newly acquired operations into our business, which may_
_prevent us from realizing the strategic and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and_
_thus adversely affect our business.”_

We believe that these strategic acquisitions, coupled with our rapid and successful organic growth
initiatives, position us well to capture further market share and grow margins across the business segments in
which we operate.

Further, our lean and digital business model also allows us to benefit from strong operating leverage.
Aside from the lean operating cost base described above, we have also repositioned ourselves to become a
digital telecommunications company with an asset-light fixed model. On September 1, 2018, we demerged our
tower business into Cignal Infrastructure (at demerger and until June 2021, T-Infra). Subsequently, on January
1, 2019, one day prior to the closing of the Tele2 acquisition, we distributed Cignal Infrastructure as a dividend
in kind to Deutsche Telekom, with TMNL continuing to have full access to the contributed infrastructure
through a long-term, arms-length service agreement. In June 2021, Deutsche Telekom sold Cignal Infrastructure
to Digital Infrastructure Vehicle 1 SCSP, which is a joint venture of Cellnex and DTCP. Currently, we benefit
from access to 3,150 towers owned by Cignal Infrastructure with nationwide coverage under a long term
contract for an initial term of 15 years, with the option for T-Mobile Netherlands to renew for two additional
periods of 10 years each, and at favorable terms consisting of a capped yearly cost increase in line with the
Consumer Price Index. Additionally, we continue to hold our own market-leading mobile spectrum portfolio.

In our fixed segment we also have an asset-light model. Our partners, Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest,
are conducting the roll-out of our FTTH network, and we do not have any direct fixed access network
ownership. We expect to have access to the over one million FTTH homes that Open Dutch Fiber is scheduled
to roll out to by 2025 in densely-populated areas with strong TMNL mobile customer presence. Under the


-----

Primvest partnership, we expect that we will have FTTH access to approximately 130,000 homes passed. By
the terms of this partnership, we benefit from an initial period of exclusivity and line prices with base rates of
not more than €15 per month, indexed to inflation and subject to certain adjustments. In both of these
partnerships, we have agreed to certain utilization commitments. In addition, we have access to approximately
two million homes passed on KPN’s Open Distribution Framework footprint which is completed by WBA for
a nationwide fixed network footprint.

Such a lean business model has allowed us to achieve total capital expenditure savings of over €700
million, estimated as savings as a result of us not having to allocate and devote capital expenditure on building
a fiber network and mobile towers for five years.

**_Strong cash flow profile with demonstrated resilience and strong cash generation_**

We have historically demonstrated a track record of growth, profitability improvement and strong cash
flow generation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to maintain growth and increase
profitability, as evidenced by a 29.7% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin in 2020 in comparison to
26.7% in 2019. We believe this demonstrates the resilience of our business and of our company overall. In
addition, we generated a 56% Cash Conversion in 2020 in comparison with an average level of 30% for other
international telecommunication companies.

We delivered revenue growth in a challenging market environment between 2018 and 2020 at a 2%
CAGR. Such growth was mainly driven by a growing subscriber base and stabilizing ARPU levels in the mobile
B2C segment, as well as by strong growth in our B2C fixed business. Historically, our B2C mobile segment
has been the major contributor to revenue at a 4% CAGR between 2018 and 2020, having accounted for 47%
of total revenue in 2020. Our B2C mobile business delivered significant SIM net adds, particularly in the Simpel
and Ben brands, and relatively stable ARPUs among those of our brands that offered the increasingly-popular
unlimited data bundles. Positive developments offset a decrease in roaming revenue as a result of COVID-19–
induced travelling restrictions. Our B2C fixed segment was our fastest-growing segment, growing at a CAGR
of 11% over the past three years. We believe that this strong growth was driven by a successful FMC challenger
strategy which resulted in strong growth in subscriber base that amounted to an additional 133,000 customers
in the past three years.

We also delivered strong performance in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, both in terms of margin
expansion and growth. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin increased from 22.8% in 2018 to 29.7%
in 2020 and to 31.1% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL
exhibited a strong CAGR of 16.1% between 2018 and 2020 due to an improved gross margin, declining indirect
costs in absolute terms from cost saving programs and headcount reduction, and realization of Tele2 synergies.

Because we delivered strong revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL expansion through
challenging market conditions, we believe that we are in a position of strength and greater scale to deliver
incremental top line and profitability expansion as market conditions improve.

We also benefit from a strong cash generation profile driven by a solid top-line performance that is
combined with prudent cost management and moderate capital expenditure needs. Our Underlying Operating
Free Cash Flow increased by 53% in 2020 compared to 2019, and is expected to continue on a growth trajectory
going forward as we maintain our capital expenditure-light strategy. Our Cash Conversion was 56% in 2020
and it further increased to 58.9% during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, which is above the
average level of 30% for other international telecommunication companies.

The below chart shows our resilience and strong cash flow profile by presenting certain business
metrics for the periods under review, on a pro forma basis for the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, the demerger
of T-Infra and the application of IFRS 16, as applicable, in each case from January 1, 2018. For further
information, see “Summary—Summary Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial Information.”

**_Committed and experienced management team_**

Our experienced management team is led by our CEO, Søren Abildgaard, and our CFO, Gero
Niemeyer, each of whom has over 22 years of industry experience. Our management team is seasoned in
running, acquiring and staffing telecommunications businesses and in navigating consumer markets both in The
Netherlands and abroad, and they leverage the expertise they acquired over decades of combined experience at
top-tier telecommunications and consultancy companies such as Telia, Orange, Magenta Telekom, KPN,
Deloitte and Booz Allen Hamilton. More importantly, the management team has a strong track record of
delivering growth from both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, and has won and maintained strong
stakeholder support while maintaining a strong debt capital structure. This industry-leading management team
is supported by a deep bench of divisional managers, who in turn are supported by a substantial workforce of
1,870 full-time equivalents as of September 30, 2021. Our employees, 48% of whom are customer-facing, are
highly diverse, being represented by 45 distinct nationalities.

Our management team has reached multiple milestones. Under our management’s leadership, revenue
between 2018 and 2020 increased by a CAGR of 2% due to increasing B2C revenues, and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA AcL Margin expanded from 22.8% in 2018 to 29.7% in 2020 as driven by an improved cost structure
and synergies from the Tele2 acquisition. Furthermore, the team has successfully repositioned our company as
a full FMC challenger in addition to having executed the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions.

**Our Strategy**

We have detailed commercial plans to support our further growth, both in terms of volume and of
value, for all brands and segments. In particular, we have identified a number of key drivers leading to growth
in our business which we believe will preserve our leadership position in the future, namely (i) leverage our
leading position in the B2C mobile market, (ii) capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus, (iii) exploitation
of untapped B2B value pools and expansion in fixed and (iv) optimization of our indirect cost base ratio, with
(v) a commitment to ESG initiatives.

**_Leverage our leading position in B2C mobile and benefit from market tailwinds on 5G monetization,_**
**_unlimited offerings, portfolio optimization and increased value-added services_**

We are a leading B2C mobile operator with a SIM market share of 42% in the B2C mobile postpaid
market, corresponding to 5.1 million SIMs as of December 31, 2020. B2C revenue growth resulted from


-----

stabilizing ARPUs in 2019 and 2020 as well as a growing subscriber base, further supported by growth in
unlimited bundles on T-Mobile and Tele2 as well as an increasing demand for cheaper bundles with Ben and
Simpel. We have also seen continued growth in our customer satisfaction. For B2C mobile, we have delivered
the fastest increasing customer satisfaction TRI*M score over the last decade, having outpaced our competitors
in The Netherlands.

Our leading market position provides a strong platform for growth both in terms of volume and value
across all brands and segments. In particular, we plan to grow ARPU through (i) 5G monetization, (ii) unlimited
growth, (iii) portfolio optimizations, (iv) value-added services and (v) FMC growth.

_Drive 5G monetization_

We were the first operator to reach nationwide 5G coverage on the 700 MHz band in 2020, and we
believe that we are well positioned to monetize our 5G investments. We offer 5G connectivity per default to
our premium offerings, such as T-Mobile’s ‘Unlimited plan,’ or as an add-on to our value offerings, such as a
€2 p.c.m. add-on for our Tele2 customers. In the future, we plan to extend our 5G offering and continue our
more-for-more portfolio approach on the back of 5G.

_Grow unlimited offerings_

We believe that we hold a leading position in unlimited offerings based on our number of subscribers
and on our having been the first to have introduced an unlimited plan for mobile in The Netherlands. Our
premium offers in the mobile segment are unlimited plans, which we sell for €35 p.c.m. and €25 p.c.m.,
including value added tax (“VAT”), through the T-Mobile and Tele2 brands respectively. T-Mobile’s
‘Unlimited plan’ also includes 5G connectivity by default. Having introduced these offerings in 2017, our
unlimited subscriber base grew from 578,000 subscribers in December 2018 to more than a million subscribers
in June 2021. In May 2021, we also introduced an ‘Unlimited & Entertainment’ plan including access to Netflix
and Videoland, a Dutch streaming service. We intend to continue to grow our unlimited offerings in the future
as we believe that unlimited plans are a key value driver in our premium portfolio by increasing customer
loyalty and customer satisfaction, and ultimately result in above-average monthly recurring charges (“MRC”).

_Portfolio optimizations_

Our multi-brand portfolio is a key value driver that allows us to effectively compete in all market
segments. All our brands have a distinctive positioning, minimizing the risk of intra-brand competition. With
approximately 100,000 intra-brand migrations in 2020, creating an average incremental MRC of €1, we have
proven the ability to upsell to customers within our portfolio, accruing value.

_Value-added services_

We believe that by offering value-added services (“VAS”), we distinguish ourselves from our
competitors while increasing ARPU, customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. Our new ‘Unlimited &
Entertainment’ package, described above, is one such example. In addition, T-Mobile offers security options
and add-ons from the music streaming service Deezer. On Tele2, we recently introduced ‘Unlimited for a day’
and ‘Unlimited weekend’ plans which add VAS to a Tele2 portfolio that already includes, among other things,
a 5G priced add-on.

_FMC growth_

Compared to KPN and VFZ, who have mobile FMC penetrations of 65% and 71% as of December
31, 2020, we believe that our FMC penetration of 8% as of December 31, 2020 provides us with ample
opportunity for growth. While KPN and VFZ leverage their large fixed bases, we intend to focus on crossselling our fixed offerings into our leading consumer mobile base. Since FMC customers are more loyal, more
satisfied and have higher monthly bill sizes compared to one-product customers, we expect FMC growth to be
attractive, both, in terms of volume and value.


-----

**_Capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus_**

We are a successful challenger in the B2C fixed market with approximately 9% market share by
subscribers in 2020. In the past three years, as our business has grown its subscriber base and revenue at a
CAGR of approximately 11%, marking the fastest growth among our competitors, our market share has grown
from 7% in 2018 to 9% in 2020 and our share of total subscriber gross adds has grown from 17% in 2018 to
20% in 2020. We believe that we have been able to deliver this rapid, market-leading growth by leveraging our
challenger strategy and B2C fixed ARPUs below those of our competition, as our fixed ARPU was
approximately €33 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the market average of
approximately €50. Our price leadership is evidenced by our FMC offer which combines 1 Gbit internet speeds
and a T-Mobile Unlimited subscription for a price of €50 p.m. (€25 p.m. internet + €25 p.m. mobile
subscription), compared to €90 p.m. at KPN (€65 p.m. internet + €25 p.m. mobile) and €93 p.m. at VFZ (€65.5
p.m. internet + €27.5 p.m. mobile). These consumer bundle prices are excluding promotions. We believe this
lower fixed-segment ARPU and challenger strategy represents a strong lever to continue attracting valueseeking customers. As illustrated in the chart below, we are able to offer fixed and mobile services at a
significantly lower price than our competitors.

We have an FTTH footprint that covers approximately 1.6 million homes passed on KPN’s and
Primevest’s networks. FTTH is also achieved through the Magenta footprint. We expect a further increase of
approximately 500,000 homes passed by the end of 2021 and the Magenta footprint is expected to significantly
increase homes passed by 2025. Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest partnerships are also key pillars of this
strategy. We have secured exclusive agreements with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest in addition to benefitting
from non-exclusive ODF wholesale access to the KPN network, complemented by nationwide wholesale access
via KPN bitstream. For more about our partnerships with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest, see “—Our
_Competitive Strengths—High operational efficiency and an asset-light fixed model.” We believe that our_
partnerships with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest in particular will allow us to grow our fixed subscriber base
and drive margin expansion while maintaining healthy cash profile through our capital expenditure-light
strategy.

In the future, we plan to increase our revenue share through share gains at competitive ARPUs. First,
we plan to tap our mobile subscriber base, which is the largest in The Netherlands, to cross-sell our fixed
offerings to our mobile customers. In our T-Mobile brand, FMC penetration rose from 4% in 2018 to 20% in
2020, whereas overall for our company, FMC penetration increased from 2% in 2018 to 8% in 2020. However,
our FMC penetration remains well below the FMC penetration of our competitors. We believe our penetration
will grow in the future both as a result of a focused sales approach and because we expect more SIMs to become
FMC-eligible in 2021-2022. Planned quality improvements will also help grow and maintain our fixed base
through increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Second, we will rely on highly-competitive ARPU levels
to further drive market share gains. Going forward, we are considering shifting towards a value-based
proposition by focusing on high-end fiber speeds and value-added services.

**_Exploit untapped B2B value pools and expand in fixed_**

We have established a presence in the B2B market across all segments, namely SOHO/VSE, SMB and
LE/CE, both with our mobile and our fixed offerings which represent 71% and 29%, respectively, of our B2B
revenue in 2020. Our presence extends across all B2B customer segments with our largest exposure in the
SOHO/VSE and LE/CE segments at 36% of B2B mobile service revenues each, followed by the SMB segment
with a 25% revenue share (Source: Company information).

We have increased our revenue market share in the mobile B2B market from 17% in 2018 to 20% in
2020. For the past three years, we have the fastest-growing B2B mobile operator as measured by SIM net adds,
having earned a 43% SIM net adds share in 2020 in comparison with 31% for the closest competitor. We believe
this strategy highlights our success in attracting B2B mobile customers and managing churn well, and we
believe it will fuel our growth in the coming years. In the fixed B2B market, we had a modest revenue market
share of 4% in 2020, affording us an opportunity to grow our presence in the segment in 2021 and beyond.
Among our key priorities, we aim to transform the former Tele2 large enterprise legacy business and expand
into SOHO/VSE with fixed offerings.

Recognizing the above growth path in B2B mobile and the opportunity in B2B fixed, we have defined
a strategy to develop our potential in each of our SOHO/VSE, SMB and LE/CE B2B segments. Our
entrepreneurial approach is built on four key growth drivers, namely (i) FMC offerings in the SOHO/VSE
segment, (ii) an SMB portfolio that combines FMC offerings (a “converged” portfolio) with cloud-based
service enhancements, (iii) a differentiating partner approach and (iv) fixed transformation in the LE/CE
segment.

_FMC offerings in the attractive SOHO/VSE segment_

The SOHO/VSE segment is a highly attractive market for our services, both because of its higher
margins and because we believe we are well-positioned to succeed in this space as a result of its similarities
with the B2C segment where we are a leader in mobile. This segment has rarely been tapped by either T-Mobile
or Tele2 before and it is growing in line with the B2C market. See “—Our Competitive Strengths—Attractive
_telecommunications market structure in The Netherlands.” Given our strength in mobile offerings in particular,_
we intend to target the SOHO/VSE segment by relying on FMC offerings. For example, in September 2021,
we launched a VSE internet offering and related FMC bundling proposition in order to provide the best value
for money, thus opening an additional market segment for us and a potential source of incremental revenue.

_FMC and cloud-enhanced SMB portfolio along with differentiating partnering approach_

We operate in the SMB segment under the T-Mobile and selectively under the Tele2 brand for larger
SMB customers. Our SMB offering comprises a product portfolio focused on FMC and cloud-enhanced
solutions. In the SOHO/VSE segment, we strive for an increase of our Unlimited attach rate as a key value
driver. In addition, we believe that our SMB FMC seats will increase, driven by, among other things, a Microsoft
Teams integration that forms a unified communications solution which we were the first to launch in the Dutch
market. We have a large mobile customer base and, as in the consumer market, we intend to upsell fixed and
unified communications services to our mobile base. In addition to our core connectivity services, we sell a
broad range of communications and cloud-based solutions tailored to the customers’ needs through our
extensive partner portfolio. See also “—Capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus” above.

_Fixed transformation in LE/CE_

In the LE/CE segment, we are conducting a transformation of our fixed services in order to realize the
full potential of our extended portfolio. We are in the process of a transition from Tele2 legacy fixed
infrastructure to future-proof transactional stacks in order to accommodate changing customer demands that
request faster and more reliable connections and thus are switching to future-proof fiber-based technologies
which includes a shift from copper to fiber, from VPN to SDWAN and a phase-out of ISDN. We also intend to
supplement our stable fixed wholesale business with international carriers and Internet Service Providers by
wholeselling active services in ODF areas.

**_Optimize our indirect cost base ratio_**

We have an asset-light fixed model and have been focused on creating a lean operational setup since
2016 when we completed a reorganization under the name ‘Lean Telco’ with a headcount reduction of certain
full-time equivalents and a savings target of €30 million. We further streamlined our business with a “3F – Fit
For Future” initiative in 2018-2019, having achieved our further cost savings target of €100 million during the
two year period 2018-2019. The focus in the coming years will be on optimization of our indirect cost base
(“IDC”) ratio through:

    - _Focusing on smart growth by transforming remaining legacy architecture, digitizing processes_
towards self-service, improving fixed product quality and transforming the OSS while focusing
on high-margin segments, thereby increasing our scale;

    - _Countering inflation with efficiencies by investing in marketing automation, robotic process_
automation and first-time right focus to deliver efficiency gains as they increase productivity; and

    - _Continuing to optimize costs by investing in systems and process improvements._

**_Build on our ESG commitments_**

We are committed to ESG initiatives and have made it a priority to focus on several initiatives in order
to improve our impact on the environment and society. We intend to build on our past ESG successes with a
four-pillar ESG program. Our first pillar is sustainability. In 2020, we already used 100% green electricity and
produced 60,000 kWh of renewable energy by using our own solar panels. In 2021, we introduced eco-plastic,
E-SIMs and lighter packaging. Additionally, we have targeted a reduction to carbon neutral emission level by
2026. Furthermore, we will reduce new plastic packaging to zero by 2026. We continue to be involved in our
community in other ways, such as our establishment of two partnerships to accelerate “Innovation for Society”
projects in 2020.

For 2021 and 2022, we aim to set up three impactful “Innovation for Society” partnerships to invest in
e-health, education and smart cities. Going forward, we intend to continue setting up three partnerships a year.
We also focus on digital inclusion, as our goal is to enable more people to be part of the digital society. In 2020,
more than 2,500 people gained access to the digital society with our social SIM program and we reached more
than 15,000 people through our debt prevention program. Our target is to reach more than 25,000 disadvantaged
individuals every year.

Lastly, our management aims to foster an environment in which everyone feels included. We have set
up a dedicated work stream in the diversity and inclusion program focused on activities and awareness within
the company, sharpened our policy on social return and set up a “Back to work” fund. For 2021 and 2022, our
focus is on diversity and inclusion, such as through setting up gender-neutral communication and starting the
dialogue on safety and belonging. Our goal is to be a 100% inclusive organization by 2025.

**History of the Target Group**

TMNL’s primary subsidiaries consist of (i) T-Mobile Netherlands and its subsidiaries, including TMobile Netherlands Retail B.V. (“T-Mobile Netherlands Retail”) and, indirectly through Complex Bidco
B.V., Simpel.nl B.V. (“Simpel”), (ii) T-Mobile Thuis B.V. (“T-Mobile Thuis”) and (iii) T-Mobile Netherlands
Finance B.V. (“T-Mobile Netherlands Finance”). T-Mobile Netherlands Finance holds the financial markets
license for consumer credit issued by AFM and is the contracting party for consumers obtaining credit for
products provided by us.

Our origins can be traced back to two acquisitions in The Netherlands by the group headed by Deutsche
Telekom AG (the “Deutsche Telekom Group”). In September 2002, the Deutsche Telekom Group acquired
the Dutch mobile operator Ben Nederland Holding B.V., whose name was then changed to T-Mobile
Netherlands Holding B.V. in February 2003. The Deutsche Telekom Group also rebranded Ben to T-Mobile in
February 2003, marking the introduction of the T-Mobile brand in The Netherlands. In September 2007, we
acquired Orange Nederland N.V. and Orange Nederland Breedband B.V. from the France Télécom S.A. group.
The fixed line component of this business, acquired under Orange Nederland Breedband B.V., was eventually
rebranded and sold in January 2014 under the Online.nl brand. In 2008, we relaunched Ben as a budget brand.

In April 2010, we acquired the customer base and the ‘Simpel’ brand of the mobile service provider
Simpel Consumenten B.V from its founder Jasper de Rooij. We transferred the customer base and brand back
to de Rooij and investors in August 2014 by concluding an asset purchase agreement, and we also then signed
an MVNO agreement with Simpel, the successor company of the business, under which Simpel continued to
use our network.

In December 2016, we acquired from Vodafone Libertel B.V. the B2C fixed line internet business of
Vodafone Thuis in The Netherlands, which we renamed T-Mobile Thuis. Vodafone divested this business as
the result of an antitrust remedy ordered by the European Commission to provide clearance for the VFZ joint
venture. This acquisition added approximately 160,000 customers.

On September 1, 2018, we carved out our tower business by way of a legal demerger (juridische
_splitsing) from TMNL to Cignal Infrastructure (until June 2021, named T-Mobile Infra B.V.). As part of the_
demerger, Cignal Infrastructure was incorporated as a 100% subsidiary of T-Mobile Netherlands. On December
17, 2018, T-Mobile Netherlands and Cignal Infrastructure entered into a master services agreement governing
the relationship between us and Cignal Infrastructure and the terms and conditions of our access to these passive
infrastructure elements. Ultimately, Cignal Infrastructure was distributed as a dividend in kind to Deutsche
Telekom on January 1, 2019. As part of a later transfer of Cignal Infrastructure to Cellnex Netherlands B.V.,
on May 27, 2021 T-Mobile Netherlands and Cignal Infrastructure entered into an amended and restated master
lease agreement which replaced the master services agreement dated December 17, 2018.


-----

On January 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Tele2. The seller, Tele2 Sweden, received
approximately €190 million in cash and 25% of the issued and outstanding shares of TMNL. This transaction
was subject to the approval of European antitrust authorities, and final and unconditional approval was obtained
from the European Commission on November 27, 2018. This acquisition better enabled us to become an
integrated telecommunications provider by deepening our capacity to offer fixed and mobile subscriptions.

On December 1, 2020, we acquired Simpel pursuant to the exercise of a call option we had signed in
July 2019 for the acquisition of 100% of Complex Bidco B.V. and its 100% subsidiary, Simpel. This transaction
gained the unconditional approval of the ACM on November 16, 2020. Simpel had previously exclusively
marketed SIM-only subscriptions through its own website, using SIM cards that operated on the T‑Mobile
Netherlands network. This acquisition was effectuated in order to secure mobile market shares, create synergies,
and make us more competitive in the SIM-only consumer market.

**Geography**

Our business operates entirely in The Netherlands and all of our revenue is generated from The
Netherlands.

**Overview of Our Service Portfolio**

We offer a complete portfolio of telecommunications services and products to customers and operate
in two main customer segments: B2C and B2B. In addition, we also present in our results, an “other” segment
which consist of other revenues such as wholesale revenues and costs related to the Target Group’s
headquarters. Set forth below is a breakdown of our net revenue by customer type for the periods indicated:

**Year** **Nine months**

_B2C segment_

The B2C segment represents our largest customer segment, constituting 74.9% and 79.0% of our net
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.
Customers in this segment are offered landline, mobile phone, broadband and bundled services mainly marketed
under the T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel brands. Specifically, we provide our B2C customers with the
following multi-brand portfolio of services, aiming to cover all segments of the market:

    - Mobile services: we provide voice services, SMS/MMS and mobile broadband through our own
networks of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G spectra, with 2G scheduled to be phased out shortly. We offer
consumers mobile flexible bundled and unbundled service packages through our key brands:

      - T-Mobile: T-Mobile is our premium B2C mobile brand, focusing on premium-seekers and
households. It offers 24-month and 12-month subscriptions and combines premium
handset sales. This brand offers limited and unlimited data, text, and talk packages on both
4G and 5G spectra. Through T-Mobile Thuis, it also offers a fixed internet package with
an option to purchase voice and TV add-ons, as well as FMC packages. We market our TMobile brand through an omni-channel approach, leveraging retail stores, online sales,
telesales and indirect sales. T-Mobile’s key competitors include KPN and VFZ.


-----

      - Tele2: Tele2 is our value brand, aimed at value-seekers and digital natives. It also offers
limited and unlimited bundles with 5G as an add-on, and it also offers handsets. We intend
Tele2 to operate within its own value segment.

      - Ben: Ben is our budget-conscious brand. It offers SIM-only subscriptions in the 4G
spectrum along with a basic portfolio of handsets. Key competitors include Simyo and
Hollandsnieuwe, which are KPN’s and VFZ’s budget brands, respectively.

      - Simpel: Simpel is our low-budget mobile brand. It offers SIM-only subscriptions on the
4G spectrum exclusively through its website. Simpel’s key competitor is Youfone, which
is an MVNO on the KPN network.

    - Fixed services: Through T-Mobile Thuis, we offer nationwide fixed broadband, TV and fixed
voice services with FTTH and xDSL (copper) technologies. FTTH is offered via Primevest, Open
Dutch Fiber and KPN networks based on unbundled access through an ODF access as well as
VULA and WBA access with KPN. We also use KPN’s copper network based on unbundled
access through MDF, VULA and WBA. We also offer to combine T-Mobile Thuis’s fixed service
with T-Mobile or Tele2 subscriptions, as these FMC packages offer discounts and other benefits
for the customer in comparison to standalone service purchase.

_B2B segment_

Our B2B segment is dedicated to meeting the telecommunications needs of companies of all types and
sizes as we aim to offer telecommunications solutions and cloud based services to businesses to accompany
them in their growth. The B2B segment constituted 18.2% and 17.5% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.

For both our SOHO/VSE customers and our SMB customers, we offer FMC bundles that combine
fixed telephony landline, mobile phone, SMS/MMS, broadband and data services, as well as other value-added
services such as data centers, Unified Communications, security, cloud, storage, virtual PBX, email and videoconferencing. These bundled services allow clients access to broadband internet and fixed and mobile telephony
services which are invoiced jointly at competitive prices. Contracts from our LE/CE customers, by contrast, are
typically awarded by customized, separate mobile and fixed services tenders, and may also include data network
services.

We additionally offer standalone B2B mobile services, notably through our ‘@Work’ plans which
allow subscribers to adjust monthly their data limits and which include unlimited data plan choices. B2B mobile
revenues accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and for
the past three years we have been the fastest-growing B2B mobile operator in the Dutch telecommunications
market as measured by net adds.

For SMB and LE/CE customers, fixed internet services are currently offered under the Tele2 brand
while SOHO/VSE customers are currently offered fixed internet services under the T-Mobile brand.

_Other_

We have also entered into several wholesale agreements for the sale of certain services, such as
Ethernet connections or access to our mobile radio networks, to other providers of mobile and fixed
telecommunications services. These services are consolidated in the Other segment, which constituted 6.9%
and 3.6% of our total company revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2021, respectively.

**Our Network**

Our network is distributed throughout The Netherlands and provides both fixed line and mobile
services to customers, routing calls and data, including circuit switching services, packages switching,
authentication, data bridge with other networks, upload to the internet, value added services and interconnection


-----

to other networks. Although we own our mobile network, we do not generally own the passive infrastructure of
either our mobile or fixed networks but lease them or contract for access to them from other companies.

**_Mobile networks and spectrum_**

As of September 30, 2021, our national access network comprised 4,956 macro outdoor sites. For an
overview of the frequency bands on which these nodes are used to broadcast our network, see “—Licenses”
below. Currently, our 4G mobile network reaches approximately 99.98% of the Dutch population and our 5G
network reaches 92.31% of the Dutch population.

**_Fixed networks_**

Our fixed internet service is generally offered under the T-Mobile Thuis brand. The Magenta footprint
of our fixed internet service offers fiber internet through an ODF access as a result of several agreements and
partnerships. We have agreements with Reggefiber Operator B.V., a member of the KPN group, to provide
ODF access to their fiber network, which currently extends to 2 million homes passed as of September 30,
2021. Either party under certain conditions may terminate these agreements, including the condition that they
may be terminated by Reggefiber Operator B.V. with two years’ notice if Reggefiber Operator B.V. is no longer
required by law or regulation to provide access to its fiber grid. We also have an exclusive agreement to be the
anchor tenant of Open Dutch Fiber, a joint venture between KKR and Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners,
which aims to deploy to one million homes passed by 2025, mainly in dense urban areas with no targeted
overbuild of existing FTTH. Finally, we have an agreement with Primevest Capital Partners according to which
we will serve as an anchor tenant on a FTTH, very high speed internet network that Primevest Capital Partners
and their construction partner, VolkerWessels, will build. Following the pilot in The Hague’s Segbroek area,
this joint venture will build or has already built fiber networks in The Hague’s Loosduinen area as well as
Eindhoven and Rotterdam. This network is expected to extend to over 130,000 homes passed by mid-2022.
Under the terms of both of these agreements we are obligated to maintain certain utilization rates which we
expect to be able to maintain.

Most of the remainder of our nationwide fixed internet footprint currently relies upon KPN providing
us with WBA, MDF, ODF and VULA, whether through agreements that we have made with KPN and its
affiliates or through legacy contracts that we have inherited upon acquiring Tele2. This involves wholesale
broadband access by means of virtual unbundled local access under an open wholesale model. For more
information about our wholesale agreements with KPN, see “—Material Contracts—KPN Wholesale
_Agreements.”_

**Marketing and Sales**

_B2C segment_

We use different sales channels to market our products and services with an aim to optimize customer
reach and reduce costs. Our main sales channels are the following:

    - Exclusive retail stores: we currently operate 124 retail stores across The Netherlands, with a
slightly higher concentration in the _Randstad, the metropolitan area comprising Amsterdam,_
Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague. As of March 31, 2021, we operated these shops with an
average of 3.9 FTE per shop. In addition to providing for sales of traditional mobile offerings, the
stores represent an opportunity to market fixed broadband and bundled packages. We rent all shop
buildings from third parties and have incorporated our retail business in a separate legal entity, TMobile Netherlands Retail.

    - Indirect sales: we leverage relationships with key telecommunications partners to sell T-Mobile-,
Tele2- and Ben-branded products both online and through several offline resellers with presence
in more than 500 stores nationwide. Additionally, in fiber roll-out areas, we engage door-to-door
partners to sell T-Mobile Thuis-branded fixed internet.


-----

    - Online sales: we have prioritized the growth of our online sales channel, which benefits from
lower costs than brick-and-mortar storefront. We reached a high benchmark in online sales, with
approximately 46% of overall sales implemented through digital channels in 2020, excluding our
indirect online sales. Each brand has its own brand-specific website and a dedicated digital
marketing strategy supported by big data platforms to optimize media investment, traffic and
conversion rates. Simpel’s online sales channel represents its only platform for customer
interaction.

    - Telesales: we sell our products and services by telephone through our own and third-party call
centers, using both active direct to consumer telephone marketing and passive advertising in print,
online and television media. Our telesales channel not only focuses on customer retention but also
serves as important up-selling and cross-selling routes, as into fixed or FMC packages.

_B2B segment_

In our B2B segment, we take a differentiated approach to sales with a focus on maximizing growth
while optimizing cost to sell. At the SOHO/VSE level, we employ multiple distribution channels, including
telesales, our retail shops, online sales through our B2B web shop and sales through retail partners. At the SMB
level we rely mainly on dedicated retail partners, with some direct business channels. Finally, at the LE/CE
level, we employ key account management for all our clients, deploying both retention and acquisition teams.

**Information Technology**

Our Magenta business support system (“BSS”) stack forms the foundation for consolidating our brands
and customer segments into a suite of systems. The Magenta stack deploys industry-leading BSS systems, such
as Salesforce, Tibco, BSCS, Netcracker and SAP, and features a high degree of consolidation with no duplicate
systems. Services under the Ben brand are mostly based on the Magenta BSS systems but with independent
sales systems and customer relationship management provided by SugarCRM. The Simpel brand features a
fully outsourced, standalone BSS environment, while a legacy Tele2 BSS is maintained by Cognizant and
services a small number of LE/CE customers.

We rely on Atos, Wipro and Netcracker for application development and maintenance services as well
as, in the case of Atos and Wipro, infrastructure delivery and management on Microsoft Azure and Amazon
Web Services, as well as other related services. Wipro also provides our external 24x7 IT service desk.
Salesforce provides us its customer relationship management system.

Our IT infrastructure is based on a hybrid architecture deployed in private and public clouds and houses
a large number of applications for our business units and customers. We operate on a “cloud first” principle
such that new workloads are deployed to the public cloud by default, and more than 90% of the Magenta BSS
has been migrated to the cloud. However, in recognizing that not all IT workloads are cloud-ready, we migrate
our applications to the public or private cloud based on the requirements of our business technology, taking into
account our security-by-design framework, which aims to guarantee the security of our applications and our
compliance with relevant regulations. All personnel involved in software development activities are required to
follow an obligatory security awareness and security-by-design e-learning.

We have implemented polices and systems for GDPR compliance that consist of, among other things,
a data processing register, privacy statements for customers and employees, a group security policy, a data
retention policy, a data breach and notification policy and internal instructions on how to deal with data subjects’
rights and requests. Our designated, full-time Data Privacy Officer (“DPO”) is registered with AP and is
supported by (i) a Privacy and Complaints team, (ii) a Privacy and Compliance Specialist, (iii) risk officers,
who are a part of our Governance, Risk Management and Compliance Department and (iv) by the legal
department. In addition to providing our employees with our data protection policy along with instructions
regarding the secure handling of data, we require our employees to complete a GDPR e-learning that is repeated
every two years. We are closely monitoring developments regarding the European Commission’s proposal for
an ePrivacy Regulation.


-----

**Suppliers**

We rely on infrastructure agreements with Koning & Hartman, Spie and VolkerWessels for the
construction and/or operation of our mobile networks. We also have agreements (i) with Nokia, Cisco, Ericsson
and Huawei for mobile access, core infrastructure equipment and transmission equipment, (ii) with Cignal
Infrastructure for mobile towers, (iii) with Open Dutch Fiber, Primevest and KPN for our access to the FTTH
our partners are deploying, (iv) with Amazon Web Services, Azure, Atos and Wipro for IT equipment,
development and cloud services, (v) with Zyxel for our modems and customer premises equipment and Guidion
for home installations and (vi) with Soluno and Eurofiber for our B2B solutions.

We had also previously engaged Huawei to supply certain network-related hardware, software and
services. Since the United States’ decision in May 2019 to impose restrictions on business dealings with
Huawei, we have been in close contact with the Dutch authorities with regards to the security of our network.
Following the Telecommunications Security and Integrity Decree of November 2019 (Regeling veiligheid en
_integriteit telecommunicaite, since supplemented by the additional rules of October 2021), in April of 2021, we_
received an individual decision from the Dutch government in which requires us to replace certain specificallyidentified equipment during over a 5-year transition period. This transition period is in line with our usual
replacement cycle, and we have identified and have implemented or are implementing a transition to nonrestricted suppliers for the affected network elements.

**Employees**

The following table details the number of full-time equivalents (“FTEs”) by function, as of December
31, 2020 and as of September 30, 2021.

**As of December 31,** **As of September 30,**

**Number of FTEs by function (excluding**
**temporary employees and contractors)** **2020** **2021**

B2C .................................................................... 767 783
B2B .................................................................... 412 413
CEO .................................................................... 59 66
CFO .................................................................... 163 171
CTO .................................................................... 392 437
**Total ...................................................................** **1,793** **1,870**

The increase in employees in the period is related to acquisitions of new subsidiaries, together with
organic growth and business expansion.

In addition to the work performed by employees, we outsource certain services to third parties, such
as call-center services, and make use of independent contractors and agency workers through T-Mobile
Netherlands and T-Mobile Netherlands Retail for individuals working in stores. All retail employees are subject
to the collective labor agreement for the electro-technical retail trade (CAO voor de Elektrotechnische
_Detailhandel)._

**Insurance**

We believe the sum insured, the limits of liability, the deductibles and scope of cover in our policies
are satisfactory and suitable for companies acting in the telecommunications sector (subject to the wording of
the policies, conditions and exclusions). However, we cannot guarantee that no losses will be incurred or that
no claims will be filed against us which go beyond the type and scope of the existing insurance coverage, and
we do not insure against war, terrorism and epidemic or pandemic risks. Following the Acquisition, some of
our insurance policies will need to be arranged on a standalone basis.


-----

**Licenses**

We have the largest spectrum portfolio in The Netherlands with advantageous positioning in the
interference-free lower bands, which is both cost-efficient and gives us an indoor capacity advantage relative
to our competitors.

In the low frequency bands, we have 10 MHz of paired spectrum in the 700 MHz band, 10 MHz of
paired spectrum in the 800 MHz band and 15 MHz of paired spectrum in the 900 MHz band, with license
renewal dates in December 2040, January 2030 and February 2030, respectively. In the mid frequency bands,
we have 10 MHz of spectrum in the 1,400 MHz band, 30 MHz of paired spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band and
20 MHz of paired spectrum in the 2,100 MHz band, with license renewal dates in December 2040, December
2029 and February 2030, and December 2040, respectively. In the high frequency bands, we have 25 MHz of
paired spectrum in the 2,600 MHz band and 20 MHz of spectrum in the 2,600 MHz band, with license renewal
dates in May 2030 and January 2030, respectively.

For a visual summary of these licenses in comparison with our competitors’ spectrum portfolios, see
the chart below.

_Note: Based on used frequencies only, excluding guard bands. 10 MHz has been excluded for TMNL and KPN, respectively, on the 2,600_
_MHz band as this represents unused frequencies. VFZ currently offers 5G on the 1,800 MHz band, using DSS. Based on 2020 mobile SIMs_
_(postpaid, prepaid and B2B), TMNL including Tele2 and Simpel._

**Real Estate**

Our real estate consists of leased stores and leased office locations as well as network infrastructure,
the latter pursuant to a combination of lease and other agreements. Our headquarters are subject to a guarantee
provided by Deutsche Telekom that will be withdrawn following the Acquisition and will need to be replaced
and agreed upon with the lessor. Our entitlement to the network infrastructure required for conducting our
business is based on (i) rights of superficies related to antenna locations, (ii) lease agreements for PoP or MSC
locations, which are distribution stations which support the operations of a fixed or mobile network, (iii) site
rental agreements for installing mobile equipment and (iv) a commercial agreement with Cignal Infrastructure.

**Separation from Deutsche Telekom**

Following the Acquisition, we will have to deal on a standalone basis with certain procedures that until
now had been dealt with through Deutsche Telekom AG and its affiliates, or through frameworks arranged by


-----

Deutsche Telekom AG and its affiliates, such as (i) our license to the T-Mobile brand, which automatically
renewed while we were a member of the Deutsche Telekom Group but which we will need to agree or negotiate
to extend with Deutsche Telekom AG once the term of the license which we will acquire in connection with
the Acquisition expires, (ii) services that the Deutsche Telekom Group provided to us relating to IT, network,
marketing, personnel and procurement, (iii) cash pooling and cash management arrangements for financing and
treasury solutions, (iv) existing parent guarantees to third parties for our benefit and (v) insurance policies. In
this regard, as a condition of completing of the Acquisition, we will enter into a transitional services agreement
with Deutsche Telekom AG pursuant to which the Deutsche Telekom AG and/or its affiliates would agree to
provide us the relevant transitional support and services for certain agreed fees. We expect to avail of transitional
services from Deutsche Telekom and/or its affiliates for up to five years after the Acquisition. See also “Risk
_FactorsRisks Relating to Our Separation from Deutsche Telekom.”_

In addition to altering the terms of our license of the T-Mobile brand in connection with the Acquisition
(see “—Material Contracts—T-Mobile License Agreement”), under the transitional services agreement that will
come into effect upon completion of the Acquisition, we expect that Deutsche Telekom AG and its affiliates
will continue to provide many of the network and IT resources it currently provides to us on similar pricing,
including IoT, wholesale and interconnect billing, handset and SIM card management, subscriber data
management and messaging platforms, RAN and mobile core, and cloud services. We may incur significant
one-time costs in transitioning away from other Deutsche Telekom Group network and IT services, among other
agreements, and we may face reduced buying power for other services, such as cloud services. See “Risk
_FactorsWe may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in the purchasing power that we may_
_have had during the period when we were owned by Deutsche Telekom.” Additionally, and among other_
changes, we will enter into a roaming broker arrangement on commercial terms with Deutsche Telekom and/or
its affiliates, whereas previously we had a roaming broker arrangement with Deutsche Telekom on preferential
rates, and we will need to manage our own cash pooling and factoring arrangements.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are involved in legal, regulatory, tax and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course
of our business. The proceedings initiated against us may include, among others, the following categories of
claims: claims by or on behalf of customers on grounds such as alleged misrepresentation, breach of service or
license terms, breach of telecommunications, consumer, health, privacy and unauthorized access and safety
regulations, or intellectual property claims primarily relating to alleged copyright infringement brought by
copyright collection entities; claims by suppliers and other telecommunications providers, including
telecommunications providers who use our network pursuant to wholesale services arrangements; claims by
employees; claims by tax authorities with respect to tax matters such as VAT, transfer taxes and property tax;
and claims by other administrative bodies or agencies such as claims for breach of data protection or consumer
protection regulations.

In line with an agreement we made with Dutch tax authorities in the past, we currently do not charge
VAT over disconnection fees. The Dutch tax authorities are having an internal discussion to determine their
view in this matter. The Dutch tax authorities may challenge our view that the disconnection fees are not subject
to VAT. Any such action may have material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition or results of
operations.

Additionally, we are currently being investigated by the AT, in joint cooperation with the AP,
regarding alleged breaches of data protection and telecommunications laws in connection with our sharing
certain aggregated and anonymized customer location data with CBS under a partnership with CBS that has
since terminated. If it finds against us, the AT could impose a fine of up to €900,000. For more information
about the AT investigation, see “Risk Factors—We face risks arising from the outcome of various criminal,
_civil, administrative and regulatory proceedings.”_

Prior to changing our debt collection processes and agencies in the first quarter of 2020, we sold
customer invoice receivables to Direct Pay, who, as of September 30, 2021, continues to owe us €4.3 million
under our agreement with them, which we have currently provisioned as bad debt. However, Direct Pay has
submitted claims to us in the aggregate amount of €7.5 million, first, that we have not provided sufficient
documentation regarding customer contracts and invoices, and second, that it lost profits due to unforeseen


-----

changes in the regulatory environment that diminished its ability to collect on the debts, and that we should
share the burden of such alleged lost profits. We discussed the matter with Direct Pay in the course of the third
quarter of 2021 but have been unable to resolve the dispute amicably thus far. We or Direct Pay may initiate
legal proceedings if we are not able to resolve this matter.

Further, we have been involved in litigation involving our prior and discontinued offer of ‘free
handsets’ to consumers along with mobile subscriptions, referred to as ‘all-in subscriptions.’ In 2014 and 2016,
the Supreme Court of The Netherlands gave interlocutory decisions in which it concluded that such offerings
were not compliant with statutory provisions on installment purchases, credit transactions and credit
agreements. We had voluntarily stopped offering such all-in subscriptions on September 9, 2014 for direct sales
and January 18, 2015 for indirect sales. Tele2, which we subsequently acquired, also offered all-in subscriptions
and stopped offering them on September 1, 2014. Subsequently, multiple claims vehicles and foundations have
solicited individuals to initiate mass claims against telecommunications providers who offered all-in
subscriptions. We have been in contact with several vehicles and foundations in order to reach a settlement and
have reached a settlement with Consumentenbond and ConsumentenClaim in October 2020 in particular
regarding the period and type of mobile subscription eligible for compensation as well as the calculation method
for the amount of compensation per customer. We have finalized processing claims under this settlement.
However, this settlement does not cover claims submitted by other claims vehicles and foundations. For
instance, we are in settlement discussions with MobiClaim in particular regarding potential claims on the same
matter from claimants who are not party to any settlements thus far, and ConTel approached us in mid-2021 to
express a willingness to pursue certain claims that have been pending since 2016. Such negotiations may fail
and it is possible that MobiClaim or ConTel will initiate legal proceedings.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are not aware of any other legal, administrative,
judicial, regulatory, tax or arbitral proceedings or investigations (including any pending or threatened
proceedings or investigations) that are likely to have, or have had, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of legal proceedings
and investigations, however, can be extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we can offer no assurances
in this regard. See also “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters—We face risks
_arising from the outcome of various criminal, civil, administrative and regulatory proceedings.”_

**Environmental, Social and Governance Matters**

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to land use, environmental protection and
health and safety in connection with our ownership of real property and other operations. While we could incur
costs, such as clean-up costs, fines and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of
violations of or liabilities under such laws or regulations, we believe we substantially comply with the applicable
requirements of such laws and regulations and follow standardized procedures to manage environmental risks.
Given the scope of our activities and the property, plant and equipment we own or operate, we believe that there
are no environmental factors likely to have a significant impact on the use of our current property, plant and
equipment other than as disclosed in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our
_business may be adversely affected by actual or perceived health risks and other environmental requirements_
_relating to mobile telecommunications transmission equipment and devices, including the location of_
_antennas.” We have recognized no material liabilities, expenses, assets or contingencies, and have made no_
provisions, relating to environmental matters.

With regards to our mobile network, we comply with regulations setting out rules governing the public
radio domain, restrictions on radio-electric emissions and health protection measures. Radiocommunications
Agency Netherlands (“AT”) (Agentschap Telecom) performs regular checks on us to verify our compliance
with our license obligations. We carry out all of our activities in strict compliance with applicable regulations,
and in accordance with Dutch recommendations, to safeguard public health.

We are committed to ESG initiatives and have made it a priority to focus on several commitments in
order to improve our impact on the environment and society. For a description of some of our ESG initiatives,
see “—Our Strategy— Build on our ESG commitments” above.


-----

**Material Contracts**

Our key supplier agreements relate to, among other, interconnection and transit interworking and
roaming, network technology, information technology, logistics, outsourcing, advertising and handsets.
Furthermore as explained below, KPN is a material supplier for the fixed business of the T-Mobile Thuis and
Tele2 brands. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We depend on certain key
_partners and other third parties for the provision of hardware, software and other providers of outsourced_
_services, who may discontinue their services or products, seek to charge us prices that are not competitive or_
_choose not to renew contracts with us.”_

**_KPN Wholesale Agreements_**

Between 1998 and 2018, we or our legal predecessors executed a series of non-exclusive framework
agreements with KPN and affiliated companies that provide us access to their copper and fiber fixed internet
networks. These agreements are generally effectively of indefinite length and provide various termination rights
to both T-Mobile Netherlands or its subsidiaries and to KPN and its affiliates. In particular, under these
framework agreements, KPN or its affiliates may terminate the agreements or services under the agreements
with between two months’ and two years’ notice. These agreements provide us with MDF access services,
WBA on the OWM and through VULA, and usage rights to fiber networks. We are largely dependent on
wholesale access to KPN’s fixed network for both bitstream access and (virtual) unbundled wholesale access
products.

Wholesale access to KPN’s fixed network was previously regulated by the ACM based on “significant
market power” (“SMP”) provisions in the Dutch Telecommunications Act. As a result of a March 2020 decision
by the CBb, no such SMP provisions apply and KPN is no longer required to provide access to its copper and
fiber networks. As we can no longer rely on the former regulatory framework, KPN and its affiliates could
potentially charge prices for access without regulatory restriction or deny us access. At the moment we are
largely protected against price increases for the wholesale access services we purchase from KPN and their
affiliates by the terms of the contracts that we have concluded with them, with the exception of our contracts
for MDF access, where we lack such price protection. At our request, the ACM is reviewing ways of restoring
regulation to KPN’s fiber network through SMP or through competent authorities’ ability to impose symmetric
regulation as provided for in the European Electronic Communications Code.

**_Cignal Infrastructure Master Services Agreement_**

As a result of the carve-out of our passive telecommunications tower infrastructure to a separate legal
entity in 2018 (see “—History of the Target Group”), in December 2018 we signed a master services agreement
with Cignal Infrastructure, then known as T-Mobile Infra B.V., which governed the relationship between us
and the demerged tower business. Our current relationship is governed by an amended and restated master lease
agreement which we signed with Cignal Infrastructure on May 27, 2021. Under the agreement, we benefit from
access to 3,150 towers owned by Cignal Infrastructure with nationwide coverage under a long term contract for
an initial term of 15 years, with the option for T-Mobile Netherlands to renew for two additional periods of 10
years each, and at favorable terms consisting of a capped yearly cost increase in line with the Consumer Price
Index.

**_Primevest Partners Partnership_**

On April 9, 2019 we signed an agreement with PCIF NL I S.A.R.L., a subsidiary of Primevest Partners,
according to which we will serve as an anchor tenant on a FTTH, very high speed internet network that
Primevest Capital Partners and VolkerWessels will build. Following the pilot in The Hague’s Segbroek area,
this joint venture will build or has already built fiber networks in The Hague’s Loosduinen area as well as
Eindhoven and Rotterdam. This network is expected to extend to over 130,000 homes passed by mid-2022.

**_Open Dutch Fiber Partnership_**

RootsOpCo B.V. (“Open Dutch Fiber”) is a joint venture between KKR as majority shareholder
(80%) and Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners as minority shareholder (20%) which has committed to rolling


-----

out a fiber network to at least one million households in The Netherlands over a five-year period. The project
involves total investments into Open Dutch Fiber of at least €700 million.

On April 1, 2021, we signed an agreement to become Open Dutch Fiber’s anchor tenant under a 20year contract in which the base wholesale tariff we will be charged ranges from €13 to €15 per month, per line,
subject to certain adjustments, including an index to the Consumer Price Index with a cap of 3% p.a. We were
not involved in, and are not a party to, agreements that relate to the debt or equity financing of the Open Dutch
Fiber project.

**_T-Mobile License Agreement_**

We license the T-Mobile brand and various Deutsche Telekom AG trademarks and domain names
under a December 22, 2004 sublicense agreement between T-Mobile Netherlands and T-Mobile Global Holding
GmbH, then a member of the Deutsche Telekom Group who as licensor eventually merged into Deutsche
Telekom AG. This sub-license incorporates by reference the terms of a December 22, 2004 license agreement
between Deutsche Telekom AG and T-Mobile International AG & Co. KG. According to the terms of these
agreements, as amended, we license the T-Mobile brand for a fixed percentage of the revenue we derive from
the use of the T-Mobile brand. Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, upon completion of the
Acquisition we will sign a non-exclusive agreement with Deutsche Telekom AG on agreed terms under which
we will license the T-Mobile brand from them for a fixed percentage of the revenue we derive from the use of
the T-Mobile brand for an initial term of five years, extendable by mutual consent.

**_Tele2 License Agreement_**

We use the Tele2 brand under an eight-year license agreement with Tele2 Sweden dated February 11,
2019, according to which we make quarterly payments to Tele2 Sweden out of the revenues from sales under
the Tele2 brand. Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, upon completion of the Acquisition we will
sign a non-exclusive agreement with Tele2 Sweden under which we license the T-Mobile brand for them for a
certain percentage of our Tele2-branded revenue for an initial term of ten years, with such percentage varying
over that term according to a schedule.

**_Other Agreements_**

Other key agreements include, among others, agreements with resellers and dealers, producers of
television content, and agreements for the distribution of TV channels. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Our Business and Industry—We depend on third parties to market, sell and provide a portion of our mobile and_
_fixed line products and services. If we fail to maintain or further develop our distribution and customer care_
_channels, our ability to sustain and further grow our subscriber base could be materially adversely affected._


-----

**REGULATION**

**General**

Our business is subject to various regulatory requirements and obligations including communications
and broadcasting laws, general antitrust law, environmental, health and safety laws, planning and construction
laws, consumer protection laws as well as technical and other regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which
we operate. Such laws and regulations are promulgated and enforced to varying degrees by supranational
regulators such as the European Commission (“Commission”) and national, state, regional and local authorities.
The regulatory environment can have a material effect on our activities. Certain key provisions of the
regulations governing our activities in The Netherlands as of the date of this Offering Memorandum are set
forth below. This description is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all regulation in this area nor a
review of specific obligations which have been imposed on us.

**Regulatory framework—Regulation of electronic communication services**

**_Summary of European regulation_**

In the last eighteen (18) years, the telecommunications market in the European Union has been
gradually deregulated.

In March 2002, the European Union approved a new regulatory framework for electronic
communications (the “RF” or “regulatory framework”), in order to adopt a harmonized regulatory framework
among the Member States.

The RF was originally composed of five directives (the “Directives”):

    - _Framework directive: a common regulatory framework for electronic communication networks_
and services that establishes the general principles of the RF, as well as the procedure that should
be followed by national regulating authorities to impose _ex ante obligations on operators with_
significant market power (“SMP”).

    - _Universal service directive: this regulates the universal service and the rights of users of_
communication networks and services.

    - _Access directive: this regulates access to electronic communication networks and their_
interconnection.

    - _Authorization directive: this regulates the authorization of communication networks and services;_
and

    - _Directive on privacy and electronic communications: this regulates the processing of personal_
data and the protection of privacy in electronic communications.

This regulatory framework also includes three key elements:

    - a recommendation from the European Commission on important markets subject to _ex ante_
regulation (the “Market Recommendation”);

    - guidelines on market analysis and the assessment of SMP (the “Guidelines”); and

    - the decision on a regulatory framework for the radio-electric spectrum.

In November 2009, the regulatory package on electronic communications was revised in a process that
took two years, with the involvement of the European Commission, Parliament and Council. The main change
consisted of the increase in the powers of the Commission to coordinate the use of the radio-electric spectrum,
and the Commission was also granted greater powers regarding the obligations that national regulatory


-----

authorities could impose on operators with significant market power, specifically when these could create
barriers to the single market or violate EU legislation.

The revised directives also contain a set of provisions relating to new generation networks, consumer
rights and (as an exceptional measure) the functional separation of vertically-integrated companies. This
measure is adopted when the regulatory authority concludes that the obligations imposed by national regulatory
authorities on operators with significant market power in accordance with applicable legislation have not
produced effective competition and there are major, persistent competition problems and/or market risks related
to the wholesale provision of certain access markets.

In 2007, a new market recommendation was adopted by the Commission, repealing and replacing the
previous 2003 Market Recommendation, by virtue of which the markets potentially subject to ex ante regulation
were reduced from eighteen to seven . This reduction included most retail markets, mobile network access
markets and the broadcast market.

In November 2009, the European Parliament and the Regulation of the European Council created the
Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (the “BEREC”), a European body of national
regulatory authorities that acts as a consultative committee of the European Commission. The BEREC began
its activities in January 2010. The regulatory framework applicable to this body was changed by European
Regulations on December 11, 2018.

Since then, the European Commission has updated its recommendation for markets in the 2014 Market
Recommendation, removing the fixed access retail markets and wholesale rented lines with the markets subject
to ex ante regulation being reduced to four. Specifically, termination markets on fixed and mobile networks
(markets 1 and 2, respectively) and the access market to broadband in its residential and business sectors
(markets 3a, 3b and 4) were retained. Subsequently in 2020 the European Commission adopted a new
Recommendation (2020/2245) on relevant markets, reducing its remaining defined markets to a market for
wholesale local access provided at a fixed location (now market 1) and wholesale dedicated capacity (now
market 2). The recommendation became effective on December 21, 2020. It has also adopted measures aimed
at promoting the development of broadband, through the adoption of: (i) recommendations in 2010 and 2013
promoting greater harmonization and effectiveness of corrective measures for NRAs (national regulatory
authorities) concerning operators with significant market power with access to NGNs (new generation
networks); (ii) a European Directive to facilitate the roll-out of networks, and (iii) a new commission decision
on the spectrum of the following frequencies: 790-862 MHz, 880-915 MHz, 925-960 MHz, 1,710-1,785 MHz,
1,805-1,880 MHz, 1,900 -1,980 MHz, 2,010 – 2,025 MHz, 2,110– 2,170 MHz, 2.5 -2.69 GHz, and 3.4-3.8 GHz.

On July 1, 2012 Regulation (EU) No. 531/2012 on public communications networks in the EU entered
into force, with the ultimate aim of removing the differences between international roaming tariffs (the
“Regulation 531/2012”) by establishing an internal market for communication services.

This regulation makes it possible for:

    - mobile operators to use the networks of other operators in Member States at regulated wholesale
prices; and

    - clients to use voice, SMS and data services from an alternative service provider without changing
their telephone, telephone number or SIM card.

The application of regulation 531/2012 started on July 1, 2014. On June 30, 2015, the Commission
announced that it had reached a commitment with the European Parliament and the Council to eliminate excess
costs for users starting on June 15, 2017 (“RLAH”—roam like at home) and establish the principle of net
neutrality on April 30, 2016.

In November 2015, Regulation 2015/2120 entered into force, which establishes the measures to
safeguard open internet access and among other regulations, modifies Regulation 531/2012 regarding roaming.
The principle of net neutrality must ensure that all traffic that circulates through networks receives the same
treatment, irrespective of its content, source or destination. Therefore, it prohibits commercial practices that


-----

consist of blocking traffic, slowing down speed and discriminating against services. The BEREC guidelines
were published on August 30, 2016, detailing the terms of the European Regulation in order to ensure universal
internet access with a minimum quality, known as the “best effort.”

The 2015/2120 European Regulation foresaw the removal of roaming surcharges from June 2017 and
established a maximum price calendar applicable until April 2016 and for the period from April 2016 to June
2017. It also introduced specific restrictions to ensure fair use of the roaming service by users to prevent abuses
of such permanent roaming. On December 15, 2016, the European Commission approved the Regulation that
details the fair use policy and the methodology to ensure the sustainability of the removal of the roaming
surcharge for roaming providers. The BEREC Guidelines concerning the retail roaming market were published
on March 27, 2017, updating the 2016 guidelines to include and specify all the provisions introduced by the
2015 Regulations and the European Commission’s 2016 Implementing Regulations. In May 2017, Regulations
were approved changing the 2012 roaming Regulations regarding wholesale roaming markets. In February
2021, the European Commission proposed a new Regulation governing roaming, which seeks to extend the
RLAH rules and inter alia improve service levels when roaming. The new Regulation is still subject to the
European Union legislative process and may therefore be modified before entering into force. For example, a
European Parliament Committee has voted to reduce wholesale roaming fees charged between operators. Until
a final Regulation enters into force, the exact implications will remain uncertain.

In 2013, the EU announced its cyber security strategy, which included a series of measures, among
them a newly proposed Directive on network and information systems security. This regulatory proposal would
guarantee a reliable information society throughout the EU, where internet providers are also subject to security
requirements. This Directive ((EU) no. – 2016/1148)) was definitively adopted in August 2016.

In January 2012, the European Commission announced the proposed replacement for Data Protection
Directive 95/46/CE with the new General Data Protection Regulation, which is applicable to providers that
process personal data in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not. The
Regulation was published on May 4, 2016 and became application from May 25, 2018.

One of the ten strategic priorities of the European Commission for coming years is the strategy of a
digital single market adopted on May 6, 2015 and which approved several initiatives organized into three pillars
were approved: (i) better access for consumers and businesses to digital goods and services across Europe; (ii)
maximizing the growth potential of the digital economy, and (iii) creating the right conditions and a level
playing field for digital networks and innovative services to flourish. This pillar provided for the review of the
new telecommunications regulatory framework. Said review led to Directive (EU) No. 2018/1972 of the
European Parliament and the Council of December 11, 2018 that established the European Electronic
Communications Code. This is a harmonized framework to regulate electronic communication networks,
electronic communication services, associated resources and services and some aspects of terminal equipment.
The objective of the aforementioned code is to promote competition, encourage investment and strengthen the
internal market and consumer rights.

In 2016, the Commission also presented an action plan for the roll-out of 5G which provided a common
calendar in the EU for its coordinated commercial commissioning in 2020, as well as cooperation between
Member States and interested parties in the sector to determine and allocate spectrum bands to 5G, organize 5G
pan-European trials starting in 2018, promote worldwide common 5G regulations and encourage the adoption
of national plans for the roll-out of 5G in all Member States.

**_Competition Regulation_**

EU competition legislation applies to all its Member States.

In particular, Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”)
prohibits all agreements between companies, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices,
which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention,
restriction or distortion of competition within the European Union. Article 102 of the TFEU prohibits the abuse
by one or more companies of a dominant position within the internal market or a substantial part of it. Article
107 of the TFEU prohibits all aid provided by a Member State or through state resources that falsifies or


-----

threatens to falsify competition, by favoring specific companies or the production of specific products that affect
trade between Member States. Finally, EU Regulations on merger control demand that all mergers and
acquisitions that exceed specific turnover thresholds are notified to the European Commission for their review,
and not to the national competition authorities. The regulations prohibit mergers if they affect real competition
within the internal market or a substantial part of it, particularly as a consequence of the creation of
strengthening of a dominant position in the market. Both the European Commission and the national
competition authorities and courts have to apply European legislation on competition (although only the
European Commission has the authority to apply the law relating to state aid). In addition, there are similar
competition regulations in the national legislation of each state, and national and regional competition
authorities and courts have the authority to oversee compliance with these regulations.

**_National regulatory authorities in The Netherlands_**

_Overview_

The video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated
at the EU level. In The Netherlands, these regulations are implemented through the Telecommunicatiewet (the
Dutch Telecommunications Act, “DTA”), the Mediawet (the Dutch Media Act, “DMA”), the Wet beveiliging
_network en informatiesystemen (the Network and Information Systems Security Act, “NNIS”) and related_
legislation and regulations. The ACM in which the former Independent Post and Telecommunications Authority
(“OPTA,” _Onafhankelijke Post en Telecommunicatie Autoriteit) as well as the former Dutch Competition_
Authority (“NMa,” _Nederlandse Mededingings autoriteit) have been integrated, and the Dutch_
Radiocommunications Agency (“AT,” _Agentschap Telecom) supervise and enforce compliance with certain_
parts of the DTA. Pursuant to the DTA, the ACM is designated as a National Regulatory Authority (NRA). The
Dutch Media Authority (“CvdM,” Commissariaat voor de Media) is authorized to enforce compliance with the
DMA. The AT is authorized to enforce the NISS with regard to network and information system providers and
any mandatory notifications of cybersecurity incidents have to be made to The Netherlands National Cyber
Security Center (“NCSC,” _Nationaal Cyber Security Centrum). The Privacy Authority (“AP”) (Autoriteit_
_Persoonsgegevens) supervises and enforces compliance with privacy legislation._

In addition to complying with industry specific regimes, we must comply with both specific and
general legislation concerning, among other areas, competition, data protection, data retention, cyber security,
internet service provider liability, consumer protection, and e-commerce. The DTA comprises a wide variety
of rights and obligations relevant to the provision of public electronic communications networks and services.
Certain key provisions included in the DTA are described below, but this description is not intended to be a
comprehensive description of all regulations in this area.

_Licensing_

The DTA contains a system of general authorizations and provides a possibility to charge supervision
costs, generally based on a percentage of the generated revenues or in case of certain specific activities a fixed
fee applied for the activity conducted by ACM. A provider of a public electronic communications network or
service needs to notify the ACM of its network or service, who will register the notification. The purpose of the
notification is to increase transparency and to ensure effective regulation and does not constitute a formal
condition for market entry.

With regard to scarce resources such as telephone numbers and frequencies, a system of (individual)
licensing or allocation by the ACM applies. The ACM, on request, administers telephone number allocation in
line with the national phone number plan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, including through AT, administers
the frequency spectrum (including auction processes and supervision) and grants licenses with regard to the use
of frequencies. Licenses for frequencies are issued upon application, either on a first-come-first-serve basis,
beauty contest or auction. A frequency license confers the right to use a specific set of frequencies in a specific
band for a specific period of time and under specific conditions, such as coverage obligations. Frequency
licenses are transferable with permission from the Minister of Economic Affairs. In addition to one-off license
fees, holders of licenses have to pay annual supervision costs, based on the amount of spectrum held. We hold
licenses in the 700, 800, 900, 1,400, 1,800, 2,100, and 2,600 MHz bands to provide 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G
communications in The Netherlands. In 2020, we acquired new licenses in the 700 MHz, 1,400 MHz band and


-----

were able to re-acquire licenses in the 2,100 MHz bands, all for a period of 20 years. The other licenses will
expire in 2030. The Dutch Government is planning to auction 300 MHz in the 3.5 GHz band, which due to
delays is presently expected to occur in the second half of 2022, but could be delayed even further. As of
December 31, 2020, we hold approximately 38% of the total mobile spectrum licenses in The Netherlands,
which are used to deliver mobile services.

_Access, Interoperability and Interconnection_

All providers of public electronic communications networks or services who control access to endusers are obliged to enter into good-faith negotiations upon the request of a competitor to conclude an
interoperability agreement. Interoperability refers to all measures, including network interconnection, which
should be implemented to ensure end-to-end connections. Although there is no obligation to reach any specific
outcome, if a provider does not comply with its obligation to enter into good-faith negotiations, the ACM, at
the other party’s request, can impose proportionate obligations on the provider in order to ensure end-to-end
connectivity.

**_Financial Services Regulation_**

We provide consumer credit to customers for payment installments for mobile devices when obtaining
a post-paid subscription. Our entity providing these services, T-Mobile Netherlands Finance B.V. is subject to
the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht).

**_Significant Market Power_**

To ensure that the telecommunications markets become genuinely competitive, the ACM can, in the
event of a possibility of consumer harm at retail level, impose ex ante regulation at wholesale level by means
of market analysis decisions on operators or service providers that have significant market power in a relevant
market. Ex ante regulation means that the ACM sets behavioral rules beforehand with which providers who the
ACM determines have significant market power must comply. A company will be deemed to have significant
market power if, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a market position equivalent to dominance,
_i.e., a position of economic strength affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of_
competitors, customers, and ultimately consumers.

Before it can be established whether an operator or service provider has significant market power, the
ACM needs to determine, in accordance with the principles of general European competition law, in which
relevant electronic communications market(s) the operator or service provider competes. The ACM must do
this while taking into account the European Commission’s “Recommendation on relevant product and service
markets within the electronic communications sector,” the latest version of which was published by the
European Commission on December 21, 2020. The ACM may also define additional relevant markets provided
that any such market meets the cumulative criteria defined by the European Commission in its so called threecriteria test for determining whether a market is susceptible to ex ante regulation.

If the ACM determines that a company has significant market power, the ACM must, subject to
appropriateness and proportionality principles, impose one or more obligations. These obligations relate to,
among other things, access and use of specific network facilities, non-discrimination, transparency, and price
regulation at both the wholesale and retail level, though the framework seeks for obligations to be imposed as
much as possible at an upstream (wholesale) level. To ensure a proper functioning of the market, these
obligations may not be disproportionate. The investigation of a relevant market, the designation of parties with
significant market power and the imposition of _ex ante obligations culminate in so-called market analysis_
decisions of the ACM. These decisions normally apply for a period of three years, after which the market
concerned needs to be re-investigated. Under the EECC this term is extended to five years.

The ACM has completed various rounds of market analyses. The Company was designated as a party
with significant market power for both the fixed terminating and mobile terminating access markets.

The analysis in respect of these markets are discussed below.


-----

**_ACM Call Termination Market Analysis Decisions_**

In respect of the call termination market, the ACM has taken the view that all providers of call
termination on fixed-line and mobile networks in The Netherlands have significant market power because all
such providers exclusively control access to end-users connected to their respective public telephone networks.
As a result, Former Ziggo (in relation to fixed call termination services) and Vodafone NL (in relation to both
fixed and mobile call termination services), have been subject to specific _ex ante obligations, including in_
particular tariff regulation (maximum termination charges), since the ACM’s third market analysis decision of
July 7, 2010. On August 5, 2013, the ACM published its fourth market analysis decision on call termination,
which combined both the fixed termination market and the mobile termination market. The new tariffs became
effective September 1, 2013, and applied for a three-year period that ended September 1, 2016. The decision
was appealed by various operators, including us, and on August 27, 2013, the Dutch Supreme Administrative
Court decided in a preliminary decision that the price cap on mobile termination charges should be higher than
the ACM had initially determined. The court ruled that the ACM should apply a so-called Bottom-up Long Run
Incremental Cost (“BULRIC”) plus cost calculation method (taking into account common overhead costs
relating also to other services than mobile call termination, (“BULRIC plus”)) rather than a pure BULRIC
method (in which such common overhead costs are to be disregarded, “pure BULRIC”). These revised tariffs
applied until the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court arrived at a final decision in the appeal proceedings on
the merits (see below). Because the pure BULRIC method used by the ACM is in fact a method recommended
by the European Commission in its 2009 Recommendation on the Regulatory Treatment of Termination Rates,
the Supreme Administrative Court posed prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice.

After an Advocate General opinion, the European Court of Justice ruled on September 15, 2016, that
deviation from the European Commission’s 2009 Recommendation on Termination Rates is only possible if
justified by national circumstances. The ACM started a new (the fifth) market analysis and published a draft
decision on November 18, 2016, in which they again regulate using a pure BULRIC calculation. The hearing
at the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court was held on January 11, 2017, and ruling given on July 10, 2017,
upheld the ACM’s use of pure BULRIC, though not requesting retroactive adjustment.

In April 2017, the ACM provided their plan to impose tariff ceilings of €0.00139 per minute for fixed
and €0.005819 per minute for mobile calls from July 1, 2017, to the European Commission. The European
Commission approved these in May, 2017. The new tariff implementation was delayed by the court decision,
until July 12, 2017. VFZ appealed ACM’s market decision. In September 2018, the appeal court delivered its
decision on VFZ’s appeal against the ACM’s Mobile Termination/Fixed-line Termination Rate (“MTR” and
“FTR”) regulations market decision. The verdict provides the relevant guidance sought by VFZ about the
interpretation and setting of interconnection tariffs among operators.

Further to the entry into force of the EECC, the European Commission has adopted a delegated act on
December 18, 2020, that will set maximum, EU-wide voice termination rates, both fixed and mobile. These
rates will be applicable to any operator providing voice call termination services in the EU. Approval of the
delegated act by the European Council and the European Parliament is expected in the course of 2021 and then,
after two months, the new rates will apply. The delegated act includes a transition period for the fixed rate that
ends on December 31, 2021, and a glide path for the mobile rates that ends on December 31, 2023. On July 21,
2020, ACM has extended the applicability of the rates that the delegated act did not regulate until the new
European rates apply.

**_ACM Wholesale Fixed Access Decision_**

On February 27, 2018, the ACM published a draft decision of its analysis of the LLU market,
concluding that there is a single market for local and central access. ACM referred to this market as the
Wholesale Fixed Access (WFA) market and concluded for the first time that KPN and VFZ had joint Significant
Market Power. As a result, ACM imposed an obligation on VFZ to offer wholesale cable access and continued
wholesale access regulation of KPN. Following a market consultation, ACM submitted the draft decision to the
European Commission. After comments by the European Commission, ACM published the final decision on
September 28, 2018, which became effective on October 1, 2018. VFZ published a draft Reference Offer on
December 31, 2018, and published tariffs on March 31, 2019. In parallel, KPN and VFZ appealed ACM’s
decision before the national court seeking annulment, while T-Mobile and Tele2 appealed with the intent to


-----

secure more stringent regulation. VFZ also initiated an action before the European General Court related to the
European Commission’s response to the consultation. The national appeal turned out successful: on March 17,
2020, the Court annulled ACM’s decision. With Court’s verdict being final, VFZ is no longer obligated to offer
cable access and has since withdrawn its reference offer. Also, KPN is no longer obligated to offer regulated
access. On July 9, 2021, the ACM indicated in a press release that it is again investigating fixed access, because
KPN’s access conditions may make it more difficult for competitors to compete, which may in the future lead
to higher prices for consumers and companies, and lower uptake of high-speed internet. In its press release the
ACM indicated that it intends to publish a new draft market analysis decision in the fall of 2021, which has not
yet been done.

**_Symmetrical access_**

The DTA is undergoing revision to fully implement the European Electronic Communications Code
and has already been revised to contain provisions enabling the ACM to impose obligations inter alia to grant
access to infrastructure within buildings or up to the first concentration or distribution point of the network. For
this to occur it is necessary that replication is economically inefficient or physically impracticable. Moreover,
should this kind of access be insufficient to overcome high and non-transitory barriers to replication within the
context of a market situation significantly limiting competitive outcomes for end users, the ACM will be able
to impose obligations beyond the first concentration or distribution point of the network. The ACM has not yet
made use of these new powers, and it remains to be seen if and how exactly they will be applied, however it is
likely that the ACM in doing so will take into account BEREC’s December 2020 Guidelines on the Criteria for
a Consistent Application of Article 61 (3) EECC. Nevertheless, they could become an alternative or addition to
its powers under the significant market power regime described below. A key difference is that for these
symmetrical access provisions to be applied, the ACM will not need to demonstrate the existence of such
significant market power (but rather replicability issues and, for access beyond the first concentration or
distribution point, a market situation significantly limiting competition outcomes for consumers). We have
requested the ACM to make use of its new powers and impose symmetrical access ACM is currently prioritizing
its market analysis decision process to impose access regulation on the basis of market dominance. The timing
of a decision based on the new powers granted to ACM under the symmetric access regulation is therefore
unclear.

**_Network and services security and continuity_**

As a provider of public electronic communication networks and services, we are subject to specific
obligations to safeguard the security and integrity of our networks and services, and to ensure the continuity of
electronic communications services in the event of disturbances or outages of the electricity grid. We are
required to notify the AT in case of disturbances, which materially threaten the continuity of our networks and
services, and the National Cyber Security Center (“NCSC”) in case of security and integrity breaches caused
by cyberattacks, which could lead to disturbance of the continuity. To mitigate the risks to continuity of mobile
services, T-Mobile, Vodafone NL, and KPN voluntarily entered into national roaming arrangements in 2014,
allowing for their respective subscribers to roam (voice and SMS) on the other parties’ networks in the event
of local outages of mobile networks where the outage is foreseen to last for more than three days and affect
over 500,000 customers. Acquisitions of control in telecommunications companies (such as ourselves, or
companies we may wish to acquire) may be subject to a notification requirement and investigation from the
perspective whether the acquisition poses a threat to the public interest, with the worst possible outcome being
a prohibition of the acquisition.

In October 2021, additional rules (Regeling veiligheid en integriteit telecommunicatie) were published
aiming to protect critical network elements, adjacent elements, security elements and control environments. The
rules include specifications for implementation, and are categorized as follows: (i) safe configuration of
technical equipment, (ii) safe configuration of networks, (iii) guarding of technical infrastructure, (iv) security
assurance for software and control services, and (v) human resource security. We will have to comply with
these rules ultimately by October 1, 2022.


-----

**_End-user Protection_**

As a provider of public electronic communication networks and services, we are subject to specific
regulations aiming to protect end-users, including regulations concerning information obligations toward
consumers, the enactment of amendments to end-user contracts, the term of end user contracts, termination
rights of consumers, quality reporting, access to emergency numbers and subscriber information, and
compensation of subscriber fees in the event of outages. Access to emergency numbers has to be provided
without limitation and free of charge. Access to subscriber information includes the provision of access to the
names, addresses and telephone numbers of our subscribers who have consented to be included in directory
enquiry services.

**_Data Protection_**

For providers of public electronic communications networks or services and further to the GDPR and
the ePrivacy Directive, a strict data protection regime applies in The Netherlands. On May 25, 2018, the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which replaced the European Data Protection Directive, came
into force. The GDPR has direct effect in The Netherlands with additional data protection obligations relevant
to our operations that include: (i) clear explanation and transparency of personal data usage to customers and
employees, and maintaining an internal data processing register, (ii) affirmative consent from users for profiling
by automated means, (iii) stronger privacy rights for users and (iv) application of privacy by design/default to
data processes. In addition to the general data protection framework of the GDPR, the DTA sets out specific
regulations for providers of public electronic communications networks and services. These regulations include
an obligation to offer certain technical facilities, such as specification of invoices, telephone number
identification and transfer of calls, rules regarding the use and processing of location data and traffic data (i.e.,
call detail records), an obligation to provide access to subscriber lists for directory services, obligations to
implement security measures to protect personal data and rules regarding unsolicited commercial
communications (“spam”). The DTA also obliges providers of public electronic communications networks to
notify the AT in case of a security breach or major outage. If this includes the leakage of personal data processed
by the provider, the AP needs to be informed as well.

On January 10, 2017, a draft ePrivacy Regulation (“ePR”) was proposed by the European Commission
to replace the ePrivacy Directive. On February 10, 2021, the Council reached an agreement on their position on
the ePR and negotiations are ongoing. It is unclear when the ePR will be agreed on by all Member States and
enter into force.

**_Lawful Interception_**

Providers of public telecommunication networks and services can only make their networks and
services available to the public if they have arranged their networks and services in such a manner that they can
be lawfully intercepted promptly. Providers of public telecommunication networks and services are obligated
to cooperate fully in the execution of a lawfully given special tapping order or permission, in accordance with
the technical and procedural requirements set forth on the basis of the DTA, and to provide relevant Dutch law
enforcement agencies information on subscribers and telecommunications traffic.

**_Net Neutrality_**

On January 1, 2013, certain provisions in the DTA with respect to net neutrality entered into force.
These provisions regulate net neutrality by, among other things, prohibiting operators of public
telecommunication networks through which internet access is provided as well as internet service providers
from blocking or restricting services or applications which are accessed via the internet other than in
circumstances set forth in the DTA. In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted a new Regulation
including the first EU-wide net neutrality regime. Following a lengthy legislative procedure, the regulation
(directly applicable in all Member States from April 30, 2016) reflects a light-handed approach to net neutrality
permitting the provision of specialized services optimized for specific content and approving reasonable traffic
management. In October 2016, a bill to change the DTA pursuant to the EU net neutrality Regulation was
adopted by the Dutch Senate. In the law, a specific obligation prohibiting tariff differentiation for data was
maintained, which however did not follow from the Regulation. The Court in Rotterdam ruled on April 20,


-----

2017, that the Dutch ban on zero rating for data is not valid as the EU net neutrality Regulation does not allow
further national regulation on this issue. Also the net neutrality regulation did not contain a prohibition of any
form of zero-rating. Therefore, the Dutch law was conflicting with the EU net neutrality regulation and had to
be set aside. As a result, the DTA was amended to properly reflect the EU regulation. The special interest group
Bits of Freedom has brought a series of legal challenges aimed at prohibiting zero rating, all of which were
unsuccessful. BEREC is currently reviewing zero rating as a result of a decision of the European Court of
Justice from September 2, 2021.

**_Radio and Television Transmission_**

The distribution of must-carry television services to the public is regulated by the DMA, entailing
obligations regarding the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast channels. On January 1, 2014,
the revised must-carry obligations became effective. The revised must carry obligations do not only apply to
cable operators, as was previously the case, but also apply to all providers of analogue and digital program
packages based on the principle of technology neutrality. Providers of digital program packages with 100,000
or more subscribers are subject to the obligation to provide at least 30 television channels, including six public
television broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation, a limited amount of regional and local television
broadcasting channels and a number of digital radio broadcasting channels. In addition, all providers of
analogue program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers must include at least 15 television channels,
including five public broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation, a limited amount of regional and local
television broadcasting channels and some analogue radio broadcasting channels. The DMA can grant a
(conditional) exemption from the obligation if the must carry obligations listed above give rise to
disproportionate costs for the network operator, an impediment to innovation or other unreasonable outcomes.

There is no regulated financing mechanism in place between network operators and broadcasters.
Commercial and public program providers must negotiate with network operators regarding transmission fees.

**_Property Rules regarding the Network_**

In accordance with the Dutch Civil Code, all public fixed-line electronic communication networks are
the legal property of the rightful constructer of the network or its legal successor, and not (by accession) of the
owner of the ground in which the network resides. Registration at the Land Registry (het Kadaster) is required
for the transfer of legal ownership and/or to encumber public networks, for example by a right of mortgage.
Registration is also required to enjoy statutory protection against title claims of third parties. We have currently
registered a substantial majority of our network at the Land Registry.

**_Roaming_**

As a result of the European Roaming Regulation, which has direct effect in The Netherlands, as of
June 15, 2017, roaming retail surcharges are no longer permitted, subject to a fair use policy. On June 15, 2017,
revised maximum wholesale roaming rates (exclusive of VAT) became effective as follows (i) outgoing calls
at €0.032 per minute, (ii) incoming calls at €0.0114 per minute, (iii) €0.01 per SMS sent, and (iv) rates for data
at €7.7 per GB decreasing annually ultimately to €2.5 per GB effective January 1, 2022.

**_International calls_**

New rules regarding intra EU communications impose regulated maximum retail prices charged to
consumers of €0.19 per minute for calls and €0.06 per SMS messages (exclusive of VAT). The rates apply to
fixed and mobile communications, effective from May 15, 2019 for a period of five years.

**_Consumer Credit_**

In June 2014, and February 2016, the Dutch (Civil) Supreme Court ruled that certain combined
propositions of mobile services and a mobile handset could, under circumstances, be qualified as, inter alia,
consumer credit and installment sales, which qualification could have consequences on the validity of certain
customer contracts and the applicability of financial laws including the supervision of the Autoriteit Financiële
_Markten (the Dutch financial market supervisory body, “AFM”). The Company was not party to the above-_


-----

mentioned proceedings. Since January 1, 2017 mobile operators are subject to the Financial Supervision Act
(“WFT” Wet Financieel Toezicht) and are required to have a license for the AFM to provide consumer credit
services when allowing customers purchasing a mobile device to pay in installments for such device. TMNL
was granted a consumer credit license by the end of 2016 and is subject to the supervision of the AFM.

In February 2021, the Dutch Minister of Finance sent a letter to the Dutch Parliament reflecting an
intention to revise consumer credit regulation in The Netherlands by lowering the threshold for document
verification required to obtain a loan for a mobile device. The proposal is to lower the threshold from €1,000 to
€250. So far, no legislative proposal has been submitted to the Dutch Parliament to execute this intention and
also no decision is taken if such proposal will be submitted.

**MANAGEMENT**

The following presents the governance structure of the Issuers as of the date of the Offering
Memorandum and the expected board of directors of TMNL following the completion of the Acquisition. After
the Acquisition, we expect certain changes to the governance of the Group, including in relation to the board of
directors of the TMNL and the Issuers.

**The Senior Secured Notes Issuer**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer was incorporated as a private limited liability company (besloten
_vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) under the laws of The Netherlands on July 20, 2021 in_
contemplation of the Transactions. The registered office of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is Strawinskylaan
3051, 1077 ZX Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and is registered with the trade registry of the Dutch Chamber of
Commerce under number 83455981.

**The Senior Notes Issuer**

The Senior Notes Issuer was incorporated as a private limited liability company (besloten
_vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) under the laws of The Netherlands on July 20, 2021 in_
contemplation of the Transactions. The registered office of the Senior Notes Issuer is Strawinskylaan 3051,
1077 ZX Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and is registered with the trade registry of the Dutch Chamber of

Waldorpstraat 60, 2521 CC The Hague, The Netherlands, and is registered under the Dutch Trade Register
number 33301092.

Currently, the Target applies the mitigated large company regime (gemitigeerd or _verzwakt_
_structuurregime) and therefore has a two-tier governance model in place with a separate supervisory board_
(raad van commissarissen) and management board (bestuur). The supervisory board is responsible for
supervising the policy pursued by, and also advises, the management board. The management board in turn
forms the management of the Target Group and is responsible for the strategy of the Target Group. Following
the completion of the Transaction, we expect to migrate to a full large company regime (structuurregime), the
two-tier board will remain in place, with the management board being appointed by the supervisory board, as a
result of the Target applying the large company regime.

We have entered into various agreements or transactions with certain related parties from time to time.
These agreements and transactions are carried out on arm’s length terms and we believe that the terms of these
agreements are no more favorable to the related parties and our affiliates than what they would have been with
disinterested third-parties.

2018, T-Mobile Netherlands and T-Infra entered into a master services agreement for TMNL’s use of towers
for a fee. Subsequently, on January 1, 2019, T-Infra was distributed out of the Target Group to Deutsche
Telekom. The agreement governing the relationship between the Target Group and T-Infra (since June 2021
named Cignal Infrastructure) was amended and restated as a master lease agreement on May 27, 2021. For more
information on the T-Infra demerger, see “Business—History of the Group.” From January 1, 2019 onwards,
pursuant to the transfer of T-Infra out of the Target Group, T-Infra’s financial information is not included in
TMNL’s consolidated financial information.

into certain transitional services agreements with Deutsche Telekom and/or its affiliates. See “Business—
_Separation from Deutsche Telekom.”_

**_Sponsors’ Management Equity Plan_**

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview_**

On September 16, 2021, WP/AP Telecom Holdings III B.V. (the “Parent”) entered into a €3.10 billion
senior secured term and revolving facilities agreement between, among others, ABN Amro Bank N.V., Banco
Santander, S.A., Banque Nomura France, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, BNP Paribas,
Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Credit Suisse AG, London Branch, Credit
Suisse (Deutschland) Aktiengesellschaft, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, ING Bank N.V., Jefferies Finance
Europe, S.L.P., Jefferies Finance LLC, KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Morgan
Stanley Bank AG, MUFG Bank, Ltd., National Westminster Bank Plc, Natwest Markets N.V., Royal Bank Of
Canada, SMBC Bank International Plc, Société Générale, London Branch, Standard Chartered Bank and
UniCredit Bank AG as arrangers and, together with Bank of China Limited, Luxembourg Branch and KB
Securities Co., Ltd and KB Securities Hong Kong Limited (as sole Korean mandated lead arranger), as
mandated lead arrangers, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Europe) S.A. Amsterdam Branch as lead
arranger and Lucid Agency Services Limited as agent (the “Agent”) and Lucid Trustee Services Limited as
security agent (the “Security Agent”) (as amended and restated on October 18, 2021 and November 25, 2021
and as amended and/or amended and restated from time to time, the “Senior Facilities Agreement”).

The Senior Facilities Agreement provided a term loan facility of €2.40 billion (the “TLB”) to WP/AP
Telecom Holdings IV B.V. as original borrower (the “Borrower”) and revolving facilities of €500 million
(“RCF 1”) and €200 million (“RCF 2,” and together with RCF 1, the “RCF,” and the RCF together with the
TLB, the “Credit Facilities”) to the Borrower.

**_Purpose_**

Borrowings funded under the TLB have been applied towards:

(a) amounts payable in connection with the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of the shares in TMobile Netherlands Holding B.V. (the “Target”);

(b) refinancing certain existing indebtedness of the Group;

(c) transaction costs in connection with the Acquisition; and

(d) working capital requirements and/or general corporate purposes of the Group.

Borrowings under the RCF may be applied towards working capital requirements and/or general
corporate purposes of the Group (for the avoidance of doubt, including without limitation the financing or
refinancing of any acquisition or capital expenditure). The RCF may be drawn in cash or letter of credit and can
be made available by lenders thereunder way of bilateral ancillary facility and fronted ancillary facilities. The
RCF is currently available until 77 months following the first utilization of the TLB (the “SFA Closing Date”).

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

Repayment of the TLB is due 84 months after the SFA Closing Date.

Repayment of loans drawn under the RCF and related interest payments will be due and payable on
the last day of the interest period for each loan. The applicable interest period is selected in the relevant


-----

utilization request or selection notice and will either be two weeks (an option in respect of the RCF only) or
one, two, three or six months subject to certain exceptions.

If it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for a lender to perform its obligations under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, such lender under the Senior Facilities Agreement will have the right to cancel its
commitments. Each Borrower shall repay the relevant lender’s participation in any loans made to that Borrower
on the date specified by the relevant lender in the notice delivered to the Parent (being no earlier than the last
Business Day of any applicable grace period permitted by law).

On a change of control or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group (subject to a leveragebased portability exception applicable to the TLB only (set at a pro forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as
defined below) of not more than 4.75:1)), a lender may, by notice to the Parent and on the first Business Day
falling at least 60 days after the date of receipt by the Parent of the notice, cancel all of its undrawn commitments
and declare all outstanding amounts owed to it due and payable provided that such request is made within 30
days of the date of the Agent’s receipt of the notification from the Parent that such change of control or sale has
occurred.

In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement requires that, in respect of each financial year of the
Parent, a mandatory prepayment of loans under the TLB is made in an amount equal to a percentage of excess
cashflow (net of a minimum threshold amount and the amount of any voluntary prepayments made during such
financial year and amounts reinvested in the business of the Group within certain time limits and certain other
permitted uses of such amounts) which percentage decreases as the Group’s Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as
defined below) decreases.

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains a prepayment fee provision whereby lenders in respect of
the TLB will, subject to customary carve-outs and exceptions, benefit from a prepayment fee of 1% of their
participation in the relevant amount of any facility under the TLB if all or part of that facility is voluntarily
prepaid in connection with a refinancing or repricing, or the Senior Facilities Agreement is amended pursuant
to a refinancing or repricing transaction, in each case, within six months of the earlier of the SFA Closing Date
and the date on which any commitment fee in respect of available commitments under the TLB is payable at a
rate equal to 100% of the then applicable margin on the TLB, the primary purpose of which (as determined by
the Parent in good faith) is to reduce the effective yield on the TLB.

**_Interest and fees_**

Borrowings under the TLB initially bear interest at a rate equal to the aggregate of EURIBOR and a
margin of 4.00% per annum.

Loans under the RCF initially bear interest at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR (in respect of
loans drawn in any currency other than Euro and Sterling), compounding overnight SONIA (in respect of loans
drawn in Sterling) and EURIBOR (in respect of loans drawn in Euro) and a margin of 3.25% per annum.

All base rates have a zero floor under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

After the date falling six (6) months after the SFA Closing Date, the margin for each loan under each
of the Credit Facilities will be subject to adjustment by reference to the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as
defined below) as shown in the quarterly financial statements or, as the case may be, the annual financial
statements for that relevant period and the related compliance certificate delivered to the Facility Agent, to
equal the rate per annum set out in the following table:

**Senior Secured Leverage Ratio** **TLB Margin** **RCF 1 Margin** **RCF 2 Margin**
**(% p.a.)** **(% p.a.)** **(% p.a.)**

Greater than 4.50:1 ................................................................................... 4.00 3.25 3.25
Equal to or less than 4.50:1 but greater than 4.25:1 .................................. 4.00 3.00 3.00
Equal to or less than 4.25:1 but greater than 4.00:1 .................................. 3.75 2.75 2.75
Equal to or less than 4.00:1 but greater than 3.75:1 .................................. 3.75 2.50 2.50
Equal to or less than 3.75:1 ....................................................................... 3.50 2.25 2.25


-----

The Margin will be further adjusted by reference to (if applicable) the ESG Agency Rating held by the
Group (which has been issued in the prior 12 months) and/or compliance / non-compliance with certain of the
ESG KPI targets in the manner set out the ESG margin ratchet table below.

For purposes of the ESG margin ratchet, ESG KPI Targets will comprise of the following (a) a target
for the Group to progressively reduce net Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (with such target to
be measured by reference to improvements made against a 2019 baseline year (with a 100% reduction to carbon
neutrality targeted by 31 December 2026)); (b) a target for the Group to progressively reduce the amount of
non-recycled or non-recyclable plastic contained in packaging products issued to market by the Group in a
relevant financial year (with such target to be measured by reference to improvements made against a 2020
baseline year (with a 100% reduction targeted by 31 December 2026)); and (c) a target to support at least 25,000
disadvantaged individuals in any financial year (including children from low income families, socially isolated
youths and elders, indebted customers and non-customers) through a variety of community assistance programs
designed to enhance quality of life through better access to and/or enhanced use and application of technology.

Default interest on each of the Credit Facilities will be calculated as an additional 1.00% per annum
on the overdue amount.

In respect of the RCF 1 and RCF 2 a “commitment fee” is payable on the available commitments under
each of RCF 1 and RCF 2, until the end of the availability period applicable to RCF 1 and RCF 2 (as the case
may be), at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for RCF 1 and RCF 2 (as the case may be). Such commitment
fee is payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability period applicable to the RCF and, if
cancelled, on the cancelled amount of the relevant lender’s commitment under the relevant RCF at the time the
cancellation becomes effective.

The Parent is required to pay customary agency fees to each of the Agent and the Security Agent in
connection with the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_Additional Facilities_**

The Parent may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility and/or as an increase in or
as additional tranches of the Senior Facilities Agreement (the “Additional Facilities”). The Parent and the
lenders in respect of the Additional Facilities may agree to certain terms in relation to the Additional Facilities,
including the margin, the termination date (each subject to parameters as set out in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) and the availability period thereof. Subject to the parameters set out in the Senior Facilities
Agreement, unless the indebtedness incurred is otherwise permitted under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
maximum aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness outstanding under all Additional Facilities (after
taking into account the application of proceeds of any relevant indebtedness) may not at any time result in a
breach of the limitation of indebtedness covenant in the Senior Facilities Agreement.

Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles as set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement (the

delivery of the Group’s annual audited consolidated financial statements for the relevant year showing that such
subsidiary is a Material Company such that the guarantors represent at least 80% of the consolidated EBITDA
of the Group (subject to certain exceptions and excluding the EBITDA of any non-obligor and the EBITDA of
any member of the Group not required to become a Guarantor in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles).

In addition, any member of the Target Group which is incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction and is a

of any non-obligor and the EBITDA of any member of the Group not required to become a Guarantor in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles).


-----

**_Financial covenant_**

With respect to the RCF only, the Senior Facilities Agreement provides that if the sum of certain
outstanding senior secured net indebtedness of the Group to the consolidated EBITDA of the Group in respect
of each relevant period ending on or after the date falling 12 Months after the SFA Closing Date (the “Senior
**Secured Leverage Ratio”) shall not exceed 8.50:1.00, the financial ratio test for that period will be satisfied,**

_provided that:_

(a) the financial covenant is only to be tested if at 5.00 pm London time on the last day of the
applicable relevant period, the amount drawn by way of loan under the RCF (including any
additional revolving facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement) (less cash and cash
equivalents and any proceeds of any RCF loan used to fund any original issue discount) is
greater than 40% of the aggregate of the commitments under the RCF (including any
additional revolving facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement) at that time; and

(b) with respect to the TLB, failure to satisfy the financial covenant ratio shall not (or be deemed
to) constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or an event of
default.

The Parent is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the net leverage covenant by applying a “cure”
amount (generally, amounts received by the Parent in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted subordinated
debt) as if consolidated EBITDA had been increased by such amount or the consolidated leverage had been
decreased by such amount. There is no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the Credit
Facilities. In each period of four consecutive financial quarters there shall be at least one financial quarter where
a different cure amount is not first taken into account and no more than five different cure amounts may be
taken into account prior to the original termination date of the TLB.

**_Events of default_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain events of default, the occurrence of which would
allow the requisite majority of lenders to, amongst other actions, accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate
their commitments, including, among other events (subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods, financial
thresholds and other qualifications):

(a) failure to pay off any amounts when due under the finance documents entered into in
connection with the Credit Facilities;


-----

(b) (with respect to the RCF only) breach of the financial covenant or (with respect to all Credit
Facilities) failure to comply with other obligations under the Credit Facilities finance
documents;

(c) inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made (subject to materiality qualifications);

(d) cross defaults in relation to certain indebtedness;

(e) (subject to certain thresholds) insolvency, insolvency proceedings and commencement of
certain creditors’ processes, such as expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or
execution;

(f) unlawfulness, invalidity rescission and repudiation, or unenforceability of the finance
documents entered into in connection with the Credit Facilities; and

(g) breach of material obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement by any holding company of
the Parent that is party thereto.

**_Debt Refinancing_**

Debt or the issue of additional Senior Notes and/or Senior Parent Notes and the introduction of a “super senior”
credit facility (the “Priority Facility”) or the establishment of new or additional Operating Facilities (each a
“Debt Refinancing”).

Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or
replacement of the then current Secured Debt Documents and/or take such other action as is required by the
Parent in order to facilitate such a Debt Refinancing including changes to, the taking of, or release and retake
of any guarantee or security, subject to certain conditions. At the option of the Parent, a Debt Refinancing may
be made available on a basis which is senior to, pari passu with or junior to any of the other liabilities, shall be
entitled to benefit from all or any of the security, may be made available on a secured or unsecured basis (subject
to certain restrictions) and may be effected in whole or in part by way of a debt exchange, non-cash rollover or
other similar or equivalent transaction, in each case unless otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing
Agreements.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement each agent, each Secured Party and each Primary
Creditor agrees that it shall co-operate with the Parent, each other member of the Group and each agent in order
to facilitate any Debt Refinancing (including by way of, at the request and cost of the Parent, executing any
document or agreement and/or giving instructions to any person).


-----

In the event of any refinancing or replacement of all or any part of the Senior Lender Liabilities (or
any such refinancing or replacement indebtedness from time to time), the Parent shall be entitled to require that
the definition of Instructing Group is amended such that the relevant refinancing or replacement indebtedness
is treated in the same manner as the Senior Facilities (meaning that for the purpose of calculating the voting
entitlement of any person, at the option of the Parent all or any part of the relevant refinancing or replacement
indebtedness may be treated as Senior Secured Credit Participations of the Senior Creditors and not Senior
Notes/Permitted Financing Credit Participations).

In the event that any Priority Facility becomes subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Parent shall be entitled to require that all or any part of the liabilities in relation to Hedging Liabilities and/or
the Operating Facility Liabilities shall rank in right and priority of payment pari passu with that Priority Facility
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, may result in such Hedging Liabilities and/or, as the case may be, Operating
Facility Liabilities ranking ahead of the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing liabilities, the
Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities) in each case unless otherwise
prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements.

Any Priority Facility implemented pursuant to a Debt Refinancing shall comply with, among others,
the following limitations:

_Ranking of a Priority Facility_

No liabilities or obligations in respect of any Priority Facility may rank in right and priority of payment
ahead of the Senior Lender Liabilities (other than amounts of the type set out in paragraphs (i) and (ii) under
the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”)

Subject to the paragraph above and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing
Agreements, any Priority Facility shall rank in right and priority of payment as determined by the Parent.

_Enforcement: Priority Facility_

The right of the lenders or other creditors in respect of a Priority Facility to:

(a) instruct the Security Agent to enforce the security;

(b) give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from
enforcing the security as they see fit; and/or

(c) otherwise provide instructions as, or as part of, an Instructing Group,

shall be generally consistent with, or otherwise not materially less favorable to the other Secured
Parties than, those customary for facilities of a similar nature to that Priority Facility (if any), in each case as at
the date such Priority Facility is contractually committed by the relevant member(s) of the Group and as
determined by the Parent (with any such determination to be conclusive).

_Option to Purchase_

(a) The Senior Notes Creditors and the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors shall be provided
with an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility
consistent in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right provided in relation to
the Senior Lender Liabilities as set out under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior
_Secured Liabilities—Option to Purchase: Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior_
_Financing Creditors.”_

(b) The Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative(s) shall be
provided with an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority
Facility consistent in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right as set out under
the paragraph captioned “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement—Option to Purchase:
_Senior Notes Creditors.”_


-----

_Supplemental Security_

Without prejudice to the provisions set out under the caption “—Ranking and Priority” and “—
_Application of Proceeds” and the other rights of the Debtors under the Intercreditor Agreement and the debt_
documents, if any member of the Group enters into any hedging agreement or Operating Facility Document at
any time after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement (which is not already secured by the Original Transaction
Security), any Debtor may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, at any time grant to the relevant
Hedge Counterparty or, as the case may be, Operating Facility Lender Supplemental Security securing all or
any Hedging Liabilities arising under the relevant hedging agreement or, as the case may be, all or any Operating
Facility Liabilities arising under the relevant Operating Facility Document. A Debtor may grant Supplemental
Security to any secured party in connection with all or any part of any New Debt Financing.

The Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries agree that Supplemental Security may be
granted by any Debtor in order to secure all or any part of any Hedging Liabilities, any Operating Facility
Liabilities and/or any New Debt Financing.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing set out this caption shall:

(a) restrict the rights of the Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries to enforce
and/or to release all or any part of the Relevant Original Transaction Security in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents; or

(b) restrict, limit or prejudice the rights and other benefits of the Debtors or any member of the
Group under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document.

Each of the Secured Parties agrees not to take any action to challenge the validity or enforceability of
the Supplemental Security by reason of it being expressed to be second ranking (or any other lower ranking).

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Debts_

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Senior Parent Liabilities and Security” below,
the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Debtors (other than any Senior Parent Debt
Issuer to the extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing
Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or the borrower) to the Primary Creditors and the
Operating Facility Lenders shall rank in right and priority of payment in the following order and are postponed
and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

(a) **first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior**
Financing Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Second
Lien Lender Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities, the Senior Arranger
Liabilities, the Second Lien Arranger Liabilities, the Senior Agent Liabilities, amounts due
to the Senior Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent Liabilities and amounts due to the Senior
Parent Notes Trustee pari passu and without any preference amongst them; and

(b) **second, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities**
_pari passu and without any preference amongst them,_

The liabilities owed by any Senior Parent Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of
Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer
or the borrower) to the Primary Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders shall rank pari passu in right and
priority of payment without any preference amongst them.

_Priority of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security shall secure the liabilities (but only to the extent
that such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:


-----

(a) **first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior**
Financing Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Senior
Arranger Liabilities, the Senior Agent Liabilities, amounts due to the Senior Notes Trustee,
the Second Lien Agent Liabilities and amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee pari
_passu and without any preference amongst them;_

(b) **second, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities**
and the Second Lien Arranger Liabilities _pari passu and without any preference amongst_
them; and

(c) **third, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari**
_passu and without any preference amongst them._

_Senior Parent Liabilities and Security_

The Senior Parent Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities owed by a Senior Parent
Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent
Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower) are
senior obligations of that Senior Parent Debt Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Senior Parent
Creditors and the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors agree that, until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date,
they may not take any steps subject to the security documents in connection with any Enforcement Action, other
than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set out in the preceding paragraph shall not impair the right
of the Senior Parent Creditors and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors to institute suit for the recovery
of any payment due by a Senior Parent Debt Issuer in respect of the Senior Parent Liabilities and/or the
Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities (in each case to the extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior Parent
Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case
may be, the borrower).

_Intra-Group Liabilities and Investor Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-Group liabilities and the liabilities of the Group to
an investor are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors and
the Operating Facility Lenders, but does not purport to rank any of those liabilities as between themselves.

_Additional and/or Refinancing Debt_

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders acknowledge in the Intercreditor Agreement that the
Debtors (or any of them) may wish to incur incremental borrowing liabilities (including guarantees of such
liabilities) (and/or incur any other indebtedness which be secured or unsecured, ranking _pari passu with or_
senior or junior to other indebtedness and with or without the benefit of any guarantee, indemnity, transaction
security or other assurance against loss) or refinance or replace borrowing liabilities (including incurring
guarantee liabilities in respect of such refinancing or replacement). Such liabilities are intended to rank pari
_passu with any other liabilities and/or share pari passu in any security and/or to rank behind any other liabilities_
and/or to share in any security behind any such other liabilities.

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders undertake in the Intercreditor Agreement (at the cost
of the Debtors) to co-operate with the Parent and the Debtors with a view to enabling and facilitating such
financing, refinancing or replacement and such sharing in the security (provided it is not prohibited by the terms
of the Debt Financing Agreements at such time) to take place in a timely manner. In particular, but without
limitation, each of the Secured Parties authorizes and directs each of its respective agents and the Security Agent
to execute any amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement and such other debt documents
and/or (subject to certain pre-conditions) release and retake of security required by the Parent to reflect, enable
and/or facilitate any such arrangements (including, as regards the ranking of any such arrangements).


-----

If a Debtor incurs any new, additional or increased liabilities under any Secured Debt Document and/or
in connection with any Debt Refinancing, at the option of the Parent, the relevant Debtor may (but subject to
the relevant Debt Financing being elected to be secured in accordance with the applicable terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the agreed security principles) grant to the relevant Secured Parties in
respect of all or any part of such Debt Financing additional security by executing additional security documents
which will benefit from the order of priority and ranking set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Liabilities_**

The Parent and the Debtors may make payments of the Senior Liabilities at any time.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Secured Creditors, the Operating Facility
Lenders, the Parent and the Debtors may at any time amend or waive the terms of the finance documents in
relation to the Senior Facilities (the “Senior Facilities Finance Documents”), the Senior Notes, the Permitted
Senior Financing Debt, the Second Lien Facility (the “Second Lien Facility Finance Documents”), the
Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents and/or any Operating Facility in accordance with their respective
terms from time to time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

_Security and Guarantees: Senior Secured Creditors_

The Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (and/or the Security Agent, a Senior
Agent and/or any other person acting on behalf of any of them) may take, accept or receive the benefit of:

(a) any security from any member of the Group in respect of any of the Senior Liabilities in
addition to the shared security provided that, to the extent legally possible and subject to

not already a party in that capacity);

Operating Facility Lender with respect to any such security shall immediately be

Senior Financing Document, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, any Permitted
Second Lien Financing Document or any Operating Facility Document;

(ii) the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the
liabilities, the benefit of which (however conferred) is, to the extent legally possible
and subject to certain agreed security principles, given to, or expressed to be given
to, all the senior secured parties in respect of their Senior Liabilities, provided that
(except for any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss permitted to be
given to any ancillary lender or issuing bank), to the extent legally possible, and
subject to certain agreed security principles,

(A) the guarantee provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a
Debtor (if not already a party in that capacity); and


-----

(B) such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement.

(c) any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the
Group in connection with:

(i) any escrow or similar or equivalent arrangements entered into in respect of amounts
which are being held (or will be held) by a person which is not a member of the
Group prior to release of those amounts to a member of the Group; or

(ii) any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase
or other discharge of any Senior Lender Liabilities, Operating Facility Liabilities,
Senior Notes Liabilities, Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities and/or Second Lien
Liabilities (in each case provided that such defeasance, redemption, prepayment,
repayment, purchase or other discharge is not prohibited by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement).

_Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders, Operating Facility Lenders, Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted_
_Senior Financing Creditors_

Creditor or Permitted Senior Financing Creditor may take certain Enforcement Action without the prior written

Financing Creditor may, to the extent it is permitted to do so under the relevant Debt Documents, take certain
Enforcement Action and/or claim in the winding up, dissolution, administration, reorganization or similar
insolvency event or process in relation to that Debtor for liabilities owing to it (but no Senior Secured Creditor
or Operating Facility Lender may direct the Security Agent to enforce the common security in any manner).

Senior Financing Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities (the
“Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors”) may, after the occurrence of an acceleration event which is
continuing, by giving not less than ten (10) days’ notice to the Security Agent (with the first notice to prevail
in the event that more than one set of Creditors serves such a notice), require the transfer to them (or to a
nominee or nominees), in accordance with the applicable transfer provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, of
all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities and the
Operating Facility Liabilities (a “Senior Liabilities Transfer”) if:

Indenture or any Permitted Senior Financing Documents (the “Senior Payment
**Default”) has occurred and is continuing;**

(b) if the Majority Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Trustee and the Permitted Majority Senior
Financing Creditors or the Senior Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted Senior
Financing Debt (as applicable) (the “Required Senior Consent”) give prior consent to that
payment being made; or

(c) if the payment is of Second Lien Agent Liabilities;

(d) of any costs and expenses of any holder of security in relation to protection, preservation or
enforcement of such security;

(e) of costs, commissions, taxes, fees and expenses incurred in respect of or in relation to (or

Financing Debt, Permitted Parent Financing Debt and/or the proceeds of any indebtedness
incurred under or pursuant to any Second Lien Debt Document and/or Senior Parent Notes;

(g) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of New Equity or Permitted
Subordinated Debt or Available Shareholder Amounts; or

year of the Parent.

On or after the Senior Discharge Date, the Debtors may make payments to the Second Lien Creditors
in respect of the Second Lien liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Second Lien Finance Documents,
as applicable.

**_Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors_**

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, no Debtor shall make (and
the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group shall make), and no Second Lien Secured Creditor
may receive from any other member of the Group, any Permitted Second Lien Payment (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, a roll-up or capitalization of any amount and Second Lien Agent Liabilities, and payments
permitted under (b) to (f) under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien Liabilities Payments”) if:

(a) a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) an insolvency event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes
Indenture and/or any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement and/or a breach of the revolving
facility financial maintenance covenant under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (a
“Material Event of Default”) is continuing, from the date which is one Business Day after
the date on which any Senior Agent delivers a notice (a “Second Lien Payment Stop
**Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Material Event of Default to**
the Parent, the Security Agent and the Senior Parent Agents until the earliest of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) in relation to payments of Second Lien Liabilities, if a Second Lien Standstill Period
is in effect at any time after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, the
date on which that Second Lien Standstill Period expires;


-----

(iii) the date on which the relevant Material Event of Default has been remedied or
waived in accordance with the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes
Indenture or any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the
Second Lien Agents cancelling the Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(v) the Senior Discharge Date; and

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent or a Second Lien Agent takes Enforcement
Action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless each of the Second Lien Agents waives this requirement, (i) a new Second Lien Payment Stop
Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior
Agent in reliance on a Material Event of Default more than 75 days after the date that Senior Agent received
notice of that Material Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same
event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of
the Agents to issue a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.
No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served by an Agent in respect of a Material Event of Default
which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Second Lien Payment Stop Notice was
issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Second Lien Debt Documents as a result of the issue of
a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the
occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing Agreement) as a consequence of
that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Second Lien Debt Document; or (ii) the issue of a
Second Lien Enforcement Notice on behalf of the Second Lien Secured Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest,
which shall continue to accrue) under any Second Lien Debt Document by the operation of the provisions set
out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Secured Creditors and
_Second Lien Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of_
any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Second Lien Debt Documents
shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop—Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the
occurrence of a Senior Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice
ceases to be outstanding and/or, as the case may be, the Senior Payment Default
ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) any Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Secured Creditors an amount
equal to any Payments which had accrued under the Second Lien Debt Documents
and which would have been Permitted Second Lien Payments but for that Second
Lien Payment Stop Notice or Senior Payment Default,


-----

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other Debt
Document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of Payments shall be waived and any Second
Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in
each case without any further action being required on the part of the Second Lien Secured Creditors or any
other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing
Group:

(i) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce or
otherwise require the enforcement of any security; and/or

(ii) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement
Action in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien
_Enforcement” below,_ _provided,_ _however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken_
except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such
action.

**_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_**

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Secured
_Creditors,” the restrictions set out under the caption “—Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on_
_Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors” above will not apply if:_

(i) an Event of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing Agreement, a
“Second Lien Event of Default”) (the “Relevant Second Lien Default”) is
continuing;

(ii) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Second Lien Default
specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Second Lien Default
from the relevant Second Lien Agent;

(iii) a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Second Lien Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Second
Lien Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Second Lien Event of Default, the relevant Second Lien Agent
may by notice (a “Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of
such Second Lien Event of Default.

_Second Lien Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the period
beginning on the date (the “Second Lien Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Second Lien Agent serves a
Second Lien Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Second Lien Event of Default
and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date;

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors)
take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Second Lien Borrower or
Second Lien Guarantor, provided, however, that if a Second Lien Standstill Period
ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Second Lien Secured Creditors may only take


-----

the same Enforcement Action in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or
Second Lien Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured
Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) against such Second Lien
Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or
a particular Second Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be
taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such
first-mentioned Second Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs
as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Senior Lenders), any Senior Notes Trustee (acting on
behalf of the Senior Noteholders) and any Senior Creditor Representative (acting on
the instructions the Majority Permitted Senior Financing Creditors) has been
obtained; and

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Second Lien Facility or
on any Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated
maturity of the amounts outstanding on that Second Lien Facility or on that
Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt, as the case may be (provided that, unless the
Senior Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise agreed by the Majority
Senior Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior
to the date falling 85 months after the SFA Closing Date (as defined in “Senior
**Facilities Agreement” above)).**

_Subsequent Second Lien Facility Defaults_

The Second Lien Secured Creditors may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in
caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” in relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default even if, at the
end of any relevant Second Lien Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Second Lien Standstill Period
has begun as a result of any other Second Lien Event of Default.

_Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Agents that it is enforcing Security created pursuant
to any security document over shares of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor, no Second Lien
Secured Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted
_Second Lien Enforcement” against that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor (or any Subsidiary of_
that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that
Security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably
likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Subject to the final two paragraphs of this section below, any of the Second Lien Agent(s) (on behalf
of the Second Lien Secured Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under any of the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture or in relation to any Permitted Senior Financing Debt which is
continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the Second Lien
Secured Creditors (or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in
respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, any Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities
and the Operating Facility liabilities if:

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by
the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lender


-----

Liabilities), any Senior Notes Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Notes
remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior Notes Liabilities), any Permitted Senior
Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which any relevant
Operating Facility Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Operating
Facility Liabilities);

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes
Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Notes remain outstanding (in the case of
the Senior Notes Liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement pursuant
to which any relevant Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in
the case of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility
Documents pursuant to which any relevant Operating Facility Liabilities remain
outstanding (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) are complied with, in
each case, other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) each of the Senior Facility Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders), the applicable
Senior Notes Trustee (on behalf of the relevant Senior Noteholders), the applicable
Senior Creditor Representative (on behalf of the relevant Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors) and the Operating Facility Lenders is paid the amounts required under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders have no
further actual or contingent liability to the Parent or any other Debtor under the
relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(v) an indemnity is provided from each Second Lien Secured Creditor (other than any
Second Lien Agent) (or from another third party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders,
the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the
Operating Facility Lenders) in a form reasonably satisfactory to each Senior Lender,
Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor and Operating Facility
Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained
or incurred by any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing
Creditor or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received or
recovered by any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing
Creditor or Operating Facility Lender from any person being required (or it being
alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender,
Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender for any reason; and

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the
Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors or the Operating Facility Lenders, except that each Senior Lender, Senior
Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor and Operating Facility Lender
shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that
it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action
to authorize the making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second
Lien Secured Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities if, at the same time, they
require a transfer of Hedging Liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such
transfer cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of Senior Secured
Liabilities may be required to be made.


-----

At the request of a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien Secured Creditors), the Senior
Facility Agent, any relevant Senior Notes Trustee, any relevant Senior Creditor Representative and the
Operating Facility Lenders shall notify the Second Lien Agents of the foregoing payable sums in connection
with such transfer.

(i) guarantees by a member of the Group of any obligations of the Group under the
Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or the Permitted Parent Financing

prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

**_Permitted Senior Parent Payments_**

Prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, any member of the Group may, directly or indirectly,
make payments with respect to the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities
then due in accordance with the finance documents in relation to the Senior Parent Notes and the Permitted
Parent Financing Debt (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Senior Parent Payments”):

another member of the Group;

(f) of any costs and expenses of any holder of security in relation to protection, preservation or
enforcement of such security;

Creditors in respect of the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities, in
accordance with the Senior Parent Notes Indenture and the Permitted Parent Financing Documents, as
applicable.

**_Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_**

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, and until the Second Lien
Discharge Date, except with the Required Second Lien Consent, no Senior Parent Debt Issuer shall make (and
the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group shall make), and neither the Senior Parent Notes
Trustee, any holder of Senior Parent Notes or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors may receive from any
other members of the Group, any Permitted Senior Parent Payment (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, a
roll-up or capitalization of any amount and certain amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee for its own
account, payments funded by amounts not received from another member of the Group or payments funded by
Permitted Parent Financing Debt and/or the proceeds of any indebtedness incurred or pursuant to any Senior
Parent Notes) if:

(a) a Senior Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) a Senior Event of Default (other than a Senior Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment
Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which any
of the Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Notes Trustee and any Senior Creditor Representative
(together, the “Senior Agents”) delivers a payment stop notice (a “Senior Parent Payment
**Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Senior Event of Default**
to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative until the earliest of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) in relation to payments of the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted
Parent Financing Liabilities, if a Parent standstill period is in effect at any time after

(iii) the date on which the relevant Senior Event of Default has been remedied or waived
in accordance with the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes
Indenture or any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior
Parent Notes Trustee and the Senior Parent Creditor Representative cancelling the
Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;

(v) the First/Second Lien Discharge Date; and

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any
Senior Parent Creditor Representative take Enforcement Action permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative waive this
requirement, (i) a new Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have
elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a Senior Event of Default more than
45 days after the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Senior Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same
event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of
the Senior Agents to issue a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of
circumstances. No Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Senior Agent in respect of a Senior
Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agents at the time at which an earlier Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent
Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior
Parent Notes Indenture or any Permitted Parent Financing Documents, as applicable) as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent
Financing Documents; or (ii) the issue of a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of
the Senior Parent Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Neither the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer nor any other Debtor shall be released from the liability
to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Parent
Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the operation of the provisions set out under
each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent
_Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those_
provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent Notes Indenture
and any Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop—Senior Parent Creditors_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the
occurrence of a Senior Payment Default, that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice
ceases to be outstanding and/or, as the case may be, the Senior Payment Default
ceases to be continuing; and


-----

(ii) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to
the Senior Parent Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued
under any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing
Document and which would have been Permitted Senior Parent Payments but for
that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or Senior Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt
document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any Senior
Parent Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in
each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Parent Creditors or any other
Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the relevant Senior Parent Debt
Issuers and other Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or
the Permitted Parent Financing Documents in accordance with their respective terms from time to time (and
subject only to any consent required under them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an
Instructing Group:

(i) no Senior Parent Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise
require the enforcement of, any security; and/or

(ii) no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action
in relation to the guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of
any member of the Group under the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or
Permitted Parent Financing Documents,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent
_Enforcement” below, provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken_
except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such
action.

**_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_**

The restrictions set out under the caption “—Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on
Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors” above will not apply if:

(i) an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior Parent Notes Finance Document and
any Permitted Parent Financing Agreement, as applicable, each a “Senior Parent
**Event of Default”) (the “Relevant Senior Parent Default”) is continuing;**

(ii) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior Parent Default
specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Parent
Default from the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent Creditor
Representative (as the case may be);

(iii) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior
Parent Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Parent Event of Default, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee
or any Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice (a “Senior Parent


-----

**Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of such Senior Parent Event of**
Default.

_Senior Parent Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean the period
beginning on the date (the “Senior Parent Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Agent serves a Senior
Parent Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Senior Parent Event of Default and
ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Parent Standstill Start Date (the “Senior
**Parent Standstill Period”);**

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a
particular guarantor of the Senior Parent Notes and/or any Permitted Parent
Financing Debt (a “Senior Parent Guarantor”), provided, however, that if a Senior
Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior Parent Finance
Parties may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Parent
Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties against
such Senior Parent Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer
or a particular Senior Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be
taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such
first-mentioned Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry
occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Senior Lenders), the Second Lien Facility Agent (acting
on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Lenders), any Senior Notes Trustee
(acting on behalf of the Senior Noteholders), any Senior Creditor Representative
(acting on the instructions the Majority Permitted Senior Financing Creditors) and
any Second Lien Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors) has been obtained; and

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding on any Senior Parent Notes or on
any Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity
of the amounts outstanding on the Senior Parent Notes or on the Permitted Parent
Financing Debt, as the case may be (provided that (i) unless the Senior Lender
Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise agreed by the Majority Senior Lenders
and the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date
falling 85 months after the SFA Closing Date (as defined in “Senior Facilities
**Agreement” above); and (ii) if any Second Lien Debt has been incurred, unless the**
Second Lien Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise agreed by the
Majority Second Lien Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity does not
fall on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after the SFA Closing Date (as
defined in “Senior Facilities Agreement” above)).

_Subsequent Senior Parent Event of Default_

The Senior Parent Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption
“—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default even if, at the
end of any relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior Parent Standstill Period
has begun as a result of any other Senior Parent Event of Default.


-----

_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Parent Agents that it is enforcing security created pursuant
to any security document over shares of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent Creditor may take any
action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement”
above against that Senior Parent Guarantor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in
accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to
adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_

Subject to the final two paragraphs of this section below, any of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and
any Senior Parent Creditor Representative (on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors) may, after an acceleration
event under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or in relation to any
Senior Notes, any Second Lien Debt, Permitted Senior Financing Debt or Permitted Second Lien Financing
Debt which is continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to
the Senior Parent Creditors (or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and
obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by
the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lenders
Liabilities), any Second Lien Facility Agreement (in the case of the Second Lien
Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior
Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior Notes Liabilities), any Permitted
Senior Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities), any Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement pursuant to
which any relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities remain outstanding
(in the case of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities) and/or any
Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which any relevant Operating Facility
Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) (as
applicable);

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lender Liabilities)), any Second Lien Facility
Agreement (in the case of the Second Lien Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes
Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Notes remain outstanding (in the case of
the Senior Notes Liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement pursuant
to which any relevant Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in
the case of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities), any Permitted Second Lien
Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which
any relevant Operating Facility Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the
Operating Facility Liabilities) are complied with, in each case, other than as
specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) each of the Senior Facility Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders), the Senior Notes
Trustee (on behalf of the relevant Senior Note Creditors), the applicable Senior
Creditor Representative (on behalf of the relevant Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors), the Operating Facility Lenders, the Second Lien Facility Agent (on
behalf of the Second Lien Lenders) and the applicable Second Lien Creditor
Representative (on behalf of the relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing
Creditors) is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Second Lien Lenders, the Senior
Note Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors, the Permitted Second Lien


-----

Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or
contingent liability to the Parent or any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt
Documents;

(v) an indemnity is provided from each Senior Parent Creditor (other than any Senior
Parent Agent) (or from another third party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders, the
Second Lien Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility
Lenders) in a form reasonably satisfactory to each Senior Lender, Second Lien
Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditor and Operating Facility Lender in respect of all costs,
expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by any Senior
Lender, Second Lien Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing
Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender in
consequence of any sum received or recovered by any Senior Lender, Second Lien
Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender from any person being
required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back
from any Senior Lender, Second Lien Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted
Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender for any reason; and

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the
Senior Lenders, the Second Lien Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors or the
Operating Facility Lenders, except that each Senior Lender, Second Lien Lender,
Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien
Financing Creditor and Operating Facility Lender shall be deemed to have
represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the corporate power
to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the making
by it of that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent Creditor
Representative (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Secured
Liabilities if, at the same time, they require a transfer of Hedging Liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor
Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement,
no transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities may be required to be made.

At the request of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent Creditor Representative (on
behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors), the Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Notes Trustee, any relevant
Senior Creditor Representative, the Operating Facility Lenders, the Second Lien Facility Agent and any relevant
Second Lien Creditor Representative shall notify the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative of the foregoing payable sums in connection with such transfer.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member of the
Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group in respect of
liabilities owed to that party shall (in the case of any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent
that such distribution would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out
below under the caption “—Turnover” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by the
Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions
and any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person
responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the Security
Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security Agent


-----

shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of
_Proceeds” below._

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are discharged
by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that
member of the Group, any Creditor and any Operating Facility Lender which benefited from that set-off shall
(in the case of any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that such distribution would
otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out below under the caption “—
_Turnover” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the_
instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant
information from the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are
discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below and subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below, if the Security
Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the
liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization
proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor (or, following an acceleration
event which is continuing, any member of the Group), each Creditor and each Operating Facility Lender
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement) against that member of the Group;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s
liabilities;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member
of the Group’s liabilities; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers
reasonably necessary to recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

Each Creditor and Operating Facility Lender will (i) do all things that the Security Agent (acting in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) reasonably requests in order to give effect to the
matters referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section and (ii) if the Security Agent
is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims”
section or if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) requests
that a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender take that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the
instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the
Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) may reasonably require,
although neither the Senior Notes Trustee nor the Senior Parent Notes Trustee shall be under any obligation to
grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender receives or recovers from any member of the Group:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
which is prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or, following the occurrence
of a Senior Distress Event which is continuing, any Senior Lender Liabilities,
Hedging Liabilities, Senior Notes Liabilities, Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities
or Operating Facility Liabilities;


-----

(ii) other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the caption “—Effect of
_Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any_
of the liabilities owed to it which does not give effect to a payment permitted under
the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, other than as referred to in the second
paragraph of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” any
amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of
a distress event (including as a result of any litigation or proceedings
against a member of the Group other than after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in respect of that member of the Group); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the
occurrence of a distress event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out
below the caption “—Application of Proceeds;”

(i) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds;” or

(ii) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on
account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group
which is not in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—
_Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence_
of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of Group,

that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender will, subject to certain exceptions: (i) in relation to receipts
and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal
to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject
to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay
that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
and (y) subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent,
promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant
liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the security unless instructed otherwise by (i) an
Instructing Group; (ii) if required as set out in the third paragraph of this section, the Majority Second Lien
Creditors or (iii) if required as set out under the fourth paragraph of this section, the “Majority Senior Parent
Creditors.”

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms (i) an Instructing
Group; (ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the security prior to the Senior
Discharge Date as described under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Secured Creditors and
_Second Lien Liabilities” above, the Majority Second Lien Creditors or (iii) to the extent permitted to enforce or_
to require the enforcement of the security prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date as described under the
provisions under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities”


-----

above, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors, may give or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security Agent
to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to
enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and,
in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed disposal, the Security Agent
shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Second Lien Creditors are then
entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under the provisions under the caption “—Permitted Second
_Lien Enforcement” above._

Prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security
Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing
Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed disposal, the
Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Senior Parent
Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under the provisions under the caption “—
_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above._

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no secured party shall have any
independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security or to exercise any rights or powers
arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent in the manner contemplated by the
Intercreditor Agreement.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement of Security—
_Enforcement Instructions,” the Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without_
limitation, the selection of any administrator, examiner or equivalent officer of any Debtor to be appointed by
the Security Agent) as:

(a) an Instructing Group;

(b) prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third
paragraph under the caption “—Enforcement of Security” above, given effect to instructions
given by the Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii) an Instructing
Group has not given instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority
Second Lien Creditors; or

(c) prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the
fourth paragraph under the caption “—Enforcement of Security” above, given effect to
instructions given by the Majority Senior Parent Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii) an
Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the security,
the Majority Senior Parent Creditors,

shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (it being
understood that, absent such instructions, the Security Agent may elect to take no action).

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Creditor (other than the Senior Notes Trustee
and the Senior Parent Notes Trustee) and each Operating Facility Lender shall agree with the Security Agent
that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory
authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any
member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the
purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can
exercise or require any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement to
exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment or
otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.


-----

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that
the security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or
recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or of any other security
interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so
applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender other than the Security Agent, then
that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may only enforce that security in accordance with instructions given
by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references
to the Security Agent shall be construed as references to that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender).

**_Consultation Period_**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce the security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or to take any other
Enforcement Action, the creditor representative(s) of the creditors of the Group represented
in the Instructing Group concerned (and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties)
shall consult with each other creditor representative, each other Hedge Counterparty, each
Operating Facility Lender and the Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to be
given by the Instructing Group for a period of not less than 10 business days (or, in the case
of any consultation involving a Senior Notes Trustee, a Senior Parent Notes Trustee or a
creditor representative in respect of any high-yield notes, debt securities or other similar
instruments, 30 days) from the date on which details of the proposed instructions are received
by such creditor representative(s), Hedge Counterparties, Operating Facility Lenders and the
Security Agent (or such shorter period as each creditor representative, Hedge Counterparty,
Operating Facility Lender and the Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”),
and only following the expiry of a Consultation Period shall the Instructing Group be entitled
to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security or refrain or cease from
enforcing the security or take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) No Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult in accordance with paragraph
(a) above and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce the security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a
Consultation Period (in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any
applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents) if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the Creditors represented in
the Instructing Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other creditor
representative, the Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into
such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the
security would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security and, where this
paragraph (b) applies any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to
protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf
of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting in relation to the matters
referred to in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above; and the Security Agent
shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.


-----

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of any instructions from an Instructing
Group to enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing the security or, as the case may
be, take any other Enforcement Action, the Security Agent shall provide a copy of such
instructions to each Agent, Hedge Counterparty and Operating Facility Lender (unless it
received those instructions from that person).

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges
that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the security prior to the
First/Second Lien Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to the
Senior Parent Creditors in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation,
management or realization of any of that security shall, subject to the section entitled Distressed Disposals
below, be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the
Debtors under general law.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant
Debtor or the Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

(i) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset
which is the subject of:

(A) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing
Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, any Permitted Second
Lien Financing Agreement, any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any
Permitted Parent Financing Agreement (each a “Debt Financing
**Agreement”) (including a disposal to a member of the Group, but without**
prejudice to any obligation of any member of the Group in a Debt Financing
Agreement to provide replacement security); or

(B) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing
Agreement pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by
a member of the Group;

(ii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document
or other agreement requested in order for any member of the Group to effect any
amendment or waiver in respect of that document or agreement or otherwise exercise
any rights, comply with any obligations or take any action in relation to that
document or agreement (in each case to the extent not prohibited by the terms of any
Debt Financing Agreement);

(iii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of
any member of the Group which has ceased to be a Debtor (or will cease to be a
Debtor simultaneously with such release); and

(iv) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other
asset to the extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt
Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company of
any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor) will
cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor (including in connection with the resignation of that Debtor or


-----

that Debtor, or a holding company of that Debtor, being designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary), the Security
Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the
Parent) promptly release (or procure the release of) that Debtor and its subsidiaries (and its and their assets)
from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “—Non-Distressed Disposals” section, the
Parent shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(i) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the
relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing
Agreement; or

(ii) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the relevant
release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured
Debt Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but without the
need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility
Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly enter into (or procure that any relevant person enters into) and
deliver such documentation and/or take such other action as the Parent (acting reasonably) shall require to give
effect to any release or other matter described above.

Without prejudice to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, if requested by the Parent in
accordance with the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and provided that the requested action is
not expressly prohibited by any of the other Debt Financing Agreements), the Security Agent and the other
Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders shall (at the cost of the relevant Debtor and/or the Parent) promptly
execute any guarantee, security or other release and/or any amendment, supplement or other documentation
relating to the security documents as contemplated by the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and
the Security Agent is authorized to execute, and will promptly execute if requested by the Parent, without the
need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender, any such release or document on behalf of the Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders). When
making any request pursuant to this paragraph (d) the Parent shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that
such request is in accordance with the terms of a Debt Financing Agreement (and the requested action is not
expressly prohibited by way of any of the other Debt Financing Agreements) and the Security Agent shall be
entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

In the case of any release of transaction security requested by the Parent pursuant to the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement as part of a Permitted Transaction (as that term is defined in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement) or pursuant to the equivalent provisions of any Second Lien Facility Agreement (each a “Permitted
**Transaction Request”), when making that request the Parent shall confirm to the Security Agent that:**

(i) such request is a Permitted Transaction Request (and absent any such statement in a
request for a release the Security Agent shall be entitled to assume for all purposes
that such request is not a Permitted Transaction Request); and

(ii) it has determined in good faith (taking into account any applicable legal limitations
and other relevant considerations in relation to that Permitted Transaction) that it is
either not possible or not desirable to implement that Permitted Transaction on terms
satisfactory to the Parent by instead granting additional transaction security and/or
amending the terms of the existing transaction security,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured
Debt Documents. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any debt
document, nothing in any security document shall operate or be construed so as to prevent any transaction,
matter or other step not prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Debt Financing


-----

Agreements (a “Permitted Action”). The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) hereby
agrees (and is irrevocably authorized and instructed to do so without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any party) that it shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly
execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to any Debt Document
(or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any security document) as is requested by the Parent in order
to complete, implement or facilitate a Permitted Action. In the event that the Parent makes any request pursuant
to and in reliance on the preceding sentence, the Security Agent shall be permitted to request a confirmation
from the Parent that the relevant transaction, matter or other step is a Permitted Action and the Security Agent
shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Senior Debt Documents to apply the
proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of
the Senior Liabilities then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other party or
result in any breach of any Senior Parent Finance Document and such application shall discharge in full any
obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or other discharge or reduction of any Senior
Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Group to apply any
proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of
any Senior Parent Liabilities to the extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any
other Senior Debt Document.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the request and at
the cost of the Parent):

(i) release the security; and

(ii) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all
liabilities, undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,
on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the
Parent).

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group which is (a)
being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security interest has become
enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b) being effected by
enforcement of a security interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s) or (c) being
disposed of to a third party subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the Security Agent
is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, or the Parent and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor):

(i) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and
deliver or enter into any release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters
of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in
the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to
release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over
any of its assets; and


-----

(C) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor
over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding
company of a Debtor, to release:

(A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all
or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other
liabilities;

(B) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of
that holding company over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor
over that holding company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that
holding company,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the
holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the
Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that
Debtor or holding company:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor
liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute
and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those
liabilities or Debtor liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other
provision of any debt document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a
Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose
of: all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors
and Operating Facility Lenders and all or part of any other liabilities and
the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the
holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent
(acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to
another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s
obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to:


-----

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intragroup liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group
lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of
the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which
is also a guarantor of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part
of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor
liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which
the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities
are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” (to the extent that the asset disposed of constituted charged
property), as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant security interest and, to the
extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor
liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take
reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent
shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to
achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities would otherwise be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect to have
those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities transferred to the Parent in which case
the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor
or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating
Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those
borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following two paragraphs, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by
or at the request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), unless the
consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal
that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and such sale or disposal is made
pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate or where a
financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that
the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may
be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security
Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified
and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that any Second
Lien Liabilities will be released or disposed of, or any security securing the Second Lien Liabilities will be
released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(a) each Second Lien Agent has approved the release; or

(b) where shares or assets of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor are sold:

(ii) all claims of the Senior Creditors, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior

Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed
of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its
affiliates) and all security under the security documents in respect of such shares or
assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released
and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that if each of the Senior
Facility Agent, any Senior Notes Trustee and any Senior Creditor Representative
(acting reasonably and in good faith):

(A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount
if any such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of
its affiliates and not released and discharged; and

(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the
Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to
the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

(iii) such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are
entitled to participate; or

(B) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an
opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in
connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into
account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement,
provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the
amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged
that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any
financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured
and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the first date on which the discharge date for the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted
Parent Financing Debt has occurred, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally, the guarantees
of the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or any security over the
assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer or any Senior Parent Guarantor will be released and/or the Senior Parent
Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities will be released, it is a further condition to the
release that either:

    - each Senior Parent Agent has approved the release; or

of its affiliates), and all security interests under the security documents in
respect of such shares or assets that are sold or disposed of is


-----

simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently

amount if such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the
purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released or discharged;
and

(II) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of
its affiliates; and

(A) such sale or disposal is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary
Creditors are entitled to participate; or

(II) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has

amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial
point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances,
including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of
such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in
respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the
Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any
financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or
secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

relating to Liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent
Financing Debt where the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the

Secured Debt Document, in payment to any person to whom the Security Agent is
obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor; and

**_Equalization of the Senior Secured Creditors_**

If, for any reason, any Senior Creditor Liabilities, Senior Notes Liabilities, Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date and the resulting
losses are not borne by the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in the
proportions which their respective exposures at the relevant enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures
of all the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders at the enforcement date, the
relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders will make such payments among
themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating
Facility Lenders in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those
proportions (or, as the case may be, to otherwise reflect the order of priority contemplated under the section “—
_Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”)._

**_Turnover of Enforcement Proceeds_**

If:

(a) the Security Agent or the relevant Agent is not entitled, for reasons of applicable law, to pay
amounts received pursuant to the making of a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or
other assurance against loss or the enforcement of the security to the Senior Secured Creditors
and the Operating Facility Lenders but is entitled to distribute those amounts to Creditors
(such Creditors, the “Receiving Creditors”) who, in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, are subordinated in right and priority of payment to the Senior
Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders; and

(b) the First/Second Lien Discharge Date has not yet occurred (nor would occur after taking into
account such payments), then the Receiving Creditors shall make such payments to the Senior
Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders as the Security Agent shall require to
place the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in the position they
would have been in had such amounts been available for application against the Senior
Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities, provided this shall not apply to any receipt
or recovery that has been distributed by:

(i) a Senior Notes Trustee to the Senior Noteholders in accordance with the Senior
Notes finance documents;

(ii) a Senior Parent Notes Trustee to the Senior Parent Noteholders in accordance with
the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents;

(iii) a Senior Creditor Representative to the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors in
accordance with the Permitted Senior Financing Documents;


-----

(iv) a Second Lien Creditor Representative to the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Creditors in accordance with the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents; or

(v) a Senior Parent Creditor Representative to the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors
in accordance with the Permitted Parent Financing Documents,

unless the Senior Notes Trustee, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee, the Senior Creditor Representative,
the Second Lien Creditor Representative or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative (as applicable) had
received at least two Business Days’ prior written notice (in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) that
an acceleration event or an insolvency event in relation to a Debtor had occurred or that the receipt or recovery
falls within the provisions set out under the caption “—Turnover” prior to distribution of the relevant amount.

**_Group Pushdown_**

The Intercreditor Agreement, generally, provides that on, in contemplation of, or after, a public equity
offering (a “Listing”) of any member of the Group (other than (x) a subsidiary of a borrower or issuer which is
restricted from being designated as such by the relevant Debt Financing Agreement and is not replaced prior to
such a public equity offering with another Group entity or (y) a subsidiary of the Parent) or any of its holding
companies (the “IPO Entity”), at the Parent’s option:

(i) the Group shall comprise only the IPO Entity and its restricted subsidiaries from
time to time;

(ii) the IPO Entity shall take on the Parent’s role under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings or other provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement shall apply to any holding company of the IPO Entity
(whether in its capacity as a Debtor or otherwise);

(iv) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Entity
(whether in its capacity as a Debtor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to,
directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking or other term of the Intercreditor Agreement or a default or an event of
default;

(v) each holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from all obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
documents (including any security granted by any such holding company; and

(vi) unless otherwise notified by the Parent:

(A) each person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor
shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor
Agreement and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor
Agreement (and from the date specified by the Parent that person shall
cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor and shall
have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement as
an investor); and

(B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party
to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor, such amendments being a
“Group Pushdown.”

In the event that any person is released from or does not become party to the Intercreditor Agreement
as an investor as a consequence of the above paragraph, any term of any debt document which requires or
assumes that any person be an investor or that any liabilities or obligations to such person be subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.


-----

The Parent must provide written notice to the Security Agent in order to implement a Group Pushdown.
Such a notice may be revoked prior to the Listing to which it relates provided that (x) the provisions of (i) to
(vi) above shall cease to apply, (y) (where requested by an Instructing Group) any security which was released
is reinstated and (z) any investor which was released from its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement
accedes again. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent shall be entitled to deliver a further written notice to the
Security Agent in order to implement a Group Pushdown in relation to any actual or contemplated Listing and
revoking a notice prior to a Listing shall not result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or
other term in the debt documents or a default or an event of default.

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or
replacement of it and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent to facilitate or reflect any of the
matters contemplated by the preceding paragraph and the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized to promptly
execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to any Debt Document
(or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any security document) as is requested in order to complete,
implement or facilitate such matters.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it and/or a security document
may be amended or waived only with the written consent of:

(ii) if any Senior Notes have been issued and the Proposed Amendment is prohibited by
the terms of the relevant Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Trustee;

that Second Lien Facility Agreement);

(iv) if any Permitted Senior Financing Debt has been incurred and the Proposed
Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Permitted Senior Financing
Agreement, the Senior Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted Senior
Financing Debt (if applicable, acting on the instructions of the Majority Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors);

(v) if any Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt has been incurred and the Proposed

Financing Agreement, the Second Lien Creditor Representative in respect of that

(vi) if any Senior Parent Notes have been issued and the Proposed Amendment is

Parent Notes Trustee;

Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Permitted Parent Financing
Agreement, the Senior Parent Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted
Parent Financing Debt (if applicable, acting on the instructions of the Majority
Permitted Parent Financing Creditors);


-----

(viii) if a Hedge Counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a hedging
agreement, that Hedge Counterparty (in each case only to the extent that the relevant
amendment or waiver adversely affects the continuing rights and/or obligations of
that Hedge Counterparty and is an amendment or waiver which is expressed to
require the consent of that Hedge Counterparty under the applicable hedging
agreement, as notified by the Parent to the Security Agent at the time of the relevant
amendment or waiver);

(ix) if an Operating Facility Lender is providing one or more facility to a Debtor under
an Operating Facility Document, that Operating Facility Lender (in each case only

waiver which is expressed to require the consent of that Operating Facility Lender
under the applicable Operating Facility Document, as notified by the Parent to the
Security Agent at the time of the relevant amendment or waiver);

(x) certain investors (as permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(xi) the Parent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment or waiver of any Secured Debt Document that is made
or effected in connection with any Debt Refinancing (see “—Debt Refinancing”), any incurrence of additional
and/or refinancing debt (as referred to in “—Ranking and Priority—Additional and/or Refinancing Debt”) or
Non-Distressed Disposal (see “—Proceeds of Disposals—Non-Distressed Disposals”) or in connection with
any other provision of any Secured Debt Document (provided that such amendment or waiver is not expressly
prohibited by the terms of any other Secured Debt Document) shall be binding on all parties to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement or a security document may be amended by the Parent and the Security
Agent without the consent of any other party, to cure defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes in each
case of a minor technical or administrative nature or as otherwise for the benefit of all or any of the Secured
Parties. Any amendment, waiver or consent which relates only to the rights or obligations applicable to creditors
under a particular Debt Financing Agreement (and which does not materially and adversely affect the rights or
interests of creditors under other Debt Financing Agreements) may be approved with only the consent of the
creditor representative in respect of that Debt Financing Agreement and the Parent.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement and unless
the provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, the Security Agent may, if authorized by an
Instructing Group, and if the Parent consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or grant
consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on each party.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs of the section captioned “—Exceptions” below, any
amendment or waiver of, or consent under, any security document which would adversely affect the nature or
scope of the charged property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed
requires approval as set out under the section captioned “—Required Consents.”

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out under the
caption “—Proceeds of Disposals” above.

The first paragraph of this “—Exceptions” section shall apply to an arranger only to the extent that the
arranger liabilities are then owed to that arranger.

Agreement overrides anything in the debt documents to the contrary.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue the Senior Secured Notes under an indenture (the
“Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date among, inter alios, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Parent
and Lucid Trustee Services Limited as trustee (the “Trustee”), The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch
as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) and The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch as transfer
agent (in such capacity, the “Transfer Agent”) and registrar (in such capacity, the “Registrar”). The Senior
Secured Notes will be issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms of the Senior Secured Notes include those stated in the
Indenture. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the
pursuit of other remedies. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate provisions by reference to, or
otherwise be subject to, the Trust Indenture Act. The Senior Secured Notes are subject to all the provisions of
the Indenture, and Holders of the Senior Secured Notes are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with funds
contributed by the Initial Investors and borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the proceeds of
the sale of the Senior Notes, will be used to finance the acquisition of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V., a
private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under
the laws of the Netherlands (the “Target” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Target Group”) and to pay
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, as set forth in this offering memorandum
under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain
other conditions as described below, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, concurrently with the closing of the
offering of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, the gross
proceeds of the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes into a euro-denominated escrow bank account (the “SSN
**Escrow Account”). In the event that, in the good faith judgment of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, (i) the**
Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to July 10, 2022 (the “Longstop Date”), (ii) the Acquisition
Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Longstop Date or (iii) certain other events occur, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to (but not including) the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date. See “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

Assuming the Completion Date (as defined below) occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date and the
funds are released from the SSN Escrow Account, the Additional Guarantors will each become a party to the
Indenture upon accession thereto and will, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, guarantee the Senior Secured Notes on a senior basis as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Completion Date but in any case no later than 150 days from the Completion Date. Prior to the Completion
Date, the Parent will not control the Target Group, and the Target Group will not be subject to the covenants
described in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the
Completion Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by
the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the
Completion Date.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the applicable perfection requirements, on the Issue Date
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis by


-----

security granted over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s beneficial interest in the SSN Escrow Account and the
Escrowed Property. On the Completion Date, the security over the SSN Escrow Account will be released, and
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured by the Initial Collateral (as
defined below), together with certain other Indebtedness of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries. See “—
_Security.”_

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents
(as defined below) and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement. The following summary does not purport to be
complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all provisions of the Indenture, the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not
contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture, the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this
description under “—Certain Definitions.”

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (defined below) and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security,
the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action,
the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

**Brief Description of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

- be senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s existing and future
debt that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including obligations in
respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s future debt that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries (including obligations to trade creditors) that is secured by property
or assets that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing
such obligation or indebtedness;

- be structurally subordinated to any future indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Parent (including
obligations to trade creditors), other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, that do not guarantee the
Senior Secured Notes;

- be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors, subject to the limitations under applicable law as
set forth under the caption “—The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees”; and

- be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below). See “Book_Entry, Delivery and Form.”_

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral on a _pari passu_ basis with all indebtedness that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and that is secured on an equal-ranking basis in


-----

the Collateral, including borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees_**

Once granted (as described under “The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees” below), each Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

- be a senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of that Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that
is not subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including obligations
in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of that Guarantor’s future indebtedness that is subordinated in
right of payment to its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

- rank effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured indebtedness of that Guarantor, to the
extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor (including
obligations to trade creditors) that is secured by property or assets that do not constitute Collateral, to
the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligations or indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any future indebtedness or other obligations of that Guarantor’s
subsidiaries (including obligations to trade creditors) that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

See “The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees.”

**Principal and Maturity**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue €800 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes on the Issue Date. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on    , 2028. The Senior Secured
Notes will be issued in global form in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day or a
business day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day (or business day at such place, as the case
may be), and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Secured Notes to receive the payments on
such Senior Secured Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Interest on the Senior Secured Notes**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of    % per annum and will be payable,
in cash, semi-annually in arrears on    and   of each year, commencing on     , 2022. Interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes on the Business Day
immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been
paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis
of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months on the aggregate principal amount outstanding. Each
interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.


-----

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s compliance with the covenants
described under the headings “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be permitted to issue additional Senior Secured_
Notes, without notice to or the consent of Holders of Senior Secured Notes, which shall have terms substantially
identical to the Senior Secured Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in
an Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) supplied to the Trustee (“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes may be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes may bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or
rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such
interest may be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the
determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such
interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes may be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the maturity date or dates of such Additional Notes, and the date or dates and price or prices at which,
the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes
may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes may be issued and redeemed;

(8) the status of registration with the SEC of such Additional Notes or the applicable exemption from such
registration pursuant to which such Additional Notes may be offered or sold; and

(9) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Senior Secured Notes, as a single class for
the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not
specifically distinguished for such series. Unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified,
for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” references to “Senior
**Secured Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Senior Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue**
Date as well as any Additional Notes. For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, Additional
Notes shall be deemed to form one series with any Senior Secured Notes previously issued if they have terms
substantially identical in all material respects to such other Senior Secured Notes. In the event that any
Additional Notes sold pursuant to Rule 144A are not fungible with any Senior Secured Notes previously issued
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such non-fungible Additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable
from such previously issued Senior Secured Notes. Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time
to time may at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code,
CUSIP or other securities identification number as Senior Secured Notes belonging to the same series
previously issued without being fungible with such series of initial Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United
**_States Federal Income Tax Considerations”) considering the purchase of Senior Secured Notes sold_**
**pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of Senior Secured Notes or in the secondary market, you**


-----

**should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you**
**of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such Senior Secured Notes, including with respect to the**
**potential issuance of Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Senior**
**Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being**
**separately identified.**

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the Global
Notes (as defined below) will be payable through one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to Euroclear or Clearstream, which will credit the account specified by the Holder (being
Euroclear and Clearstream or their nominee).

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents
(as defined below) maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on any Definitive Registered Notes may
be paid at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by bank transfer to the Holder thereof as shown on the
register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior
_Secured Notes” below._

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”)
for the Senior Secured Notes for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in registered form. The initial
Paying Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will also maintain (i) one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”)
and (ii) a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be The Bank of New York Mellon
SA/NV, Dublin Branch and the initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin
Branch. The Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register
reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make
payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.
The Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agent,
Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes without prior notice to the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. If at the time of such change, the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of The
International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”), and if and to the extent that the rules of The International
Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so require, the Company will notify the Authority that
the such change has occurred and any relevant details relating to such special mandatory redemption. The
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will initially be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global
form without interest coupons, as follows:

- Each series of the Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

- The 144A Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

- Each series of the Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without


-----

interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global
Notes, the “Global Notes”).

- The Regulation S Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. None of the Senior Secured Issuer, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance
by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

Any Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes that is transferred as described in the immediately
preceding paragraph will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the 144A Global Note from which
it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Regulation S Global Note to which it was
transferred.

In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common
Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Senior Secured Notes belonging to the same series
previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series
(including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior
to the date of issuance of such Additional Notes) will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a
Rule 144A Global Note (if any) representing Senior Secured Notes of that same series. Such a restriction could
adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes. See also “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series_
_of Notes—Additional Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible_
_with existing Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, for United States federal income tax_
_purposes,” “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Transfers” and “—Additional Notes.”_

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive
Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as
otherwise determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject
to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000
in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such
transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among others, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee
at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes,
duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange


-----

will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in
connection with such transfer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent
will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for
the purposes of the Indenture. In the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Parent will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Senior_
Secured Notes Issuer) as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive or affirmative covenants in the Indenture.

**Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will enter into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to
time, the “SSN Escrow Agreement”) among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and Lucid Agency
Services Limited, as escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its successors, the “Escrow Agent”),
pursuant to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount
in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date into the SSN Escrow
Account. The SSN Escrow Account will be segregated from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s other funds. The
SSN Escrow Account will be in the name of, and controlled by, the Escrow Agent subject to the terms of the
SSN Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. The initial funds deposited in the SSN
Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and
payments credited to the SSN Escrow Account in connection with the Senior Secured Notes (less any property
and/or funds paid in accordance with the SSN Escrow Agreement, such as ordinary course charges and fees
paid to the bank holding the SSN Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the “SSN Escrowed
**Property.”**

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will grant to the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security
interest in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s beneficial interest in the SSN Escrow Account and the SSN
Escrowed Property, pursuant to an escrow account charge dated the Issue Date between the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (the “SSN Escrow Charge”); provided, however that such liens
and security interest shall automatically be released and terminate upon receipt by the Trustee of either an
Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption. The SSN Escrow
Agreement will provide that the funds will be segregated and held for the purposes specified herein. By its
acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver
and perform its obligations under the SSN Escrow Agreement and the SSN Escrow Charge. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Acquisition—The Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks and, if it is not_
_consummated, on or prior to the Longstop Date, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes at 100% of_
_the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any.”_

The SSN Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from the SSN Escrow
Account, upon instruction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a portion of the SSN Escrowed Property in an
amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including,
the Issue Date or the most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment
date prior to the Release (as defined below) in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition,
the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the SSN Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the SSN
Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the SSN Escrowed Property.

Before the SSN Escrowed Property may be removed from the SSN Escrow Account (the “Release”),
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must determine, on or before the Longstop Date, that: (1)(i) the Acquisition


-----

will be consummated promptly following the release of the SSN Escrowed Property and (ii) no material term
or condition of the Acquisition Agreement has been amended or waived in a manner or to an extent that would
be materially prejudicial to the interests of Holders, other than any amendment or waiver made with the consent
of Holders of a majority of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes (provided that if the Majority Lenders, as
defined in, and pursuant to the Senior Facilities Agreement shall have consented to any such amendment or
waiver (or the senior facilities are drawn without any such consent being required) then the consent of the
Holders of a majority of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes shall be deemed to have been granted to such
amendment or waiver) and (2) as of the Release Date (defined below), there are no events of bankruptcy,
insolvency or court protection with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. The Release will occur as soon
as reasonably practicable following the determination described above (the date of such determination, the
“Release Date”). Upon the Release, the SSN Escrowed Property will be paid out of the SSN Escrow Account
in accordance with the SSN Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the
SSN Escrow Account will be reduced to zero.

In the event that (i) Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Longstop Date, (ii) in the
good faith judgment of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior
to the Longstop Date, (iii) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Longstop Date
or (iv) there is there an event of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection (as set out in clause (6) under “—
_Events of Default”) with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on or prior to the Longstop Date (the date_
of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will redeem the
entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the initial issue price**
of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue
Date to (but not including) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (subject to the right of holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).Notice of the Special
Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, and will provide that the Senior
Secured Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder
the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes and shall be entitled to use
the SSN Escrowed Property to make such payments. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be
given to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date.

The SSN Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the
event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds
the amount of the SSN Escrowed Property, the shareholder of the Parent will be required to fund the difference
between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the SSN Escrowed Property,
pursuant to a commitment provided by such shareholder (the “SSN Escrow Equity Commitment”). The
holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the SSN Escrow Equity
Commitment, and must rely on the Senior Secured Issuer’s rights to enforcement under the SSN Escrow Equity
Commitment.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open
one or more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, and may transfer any portion
of the SSN Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such
Transfer being deemed a Release, provided the Senior Secured Notes Issuer provides a substantially equivalent
security interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or
accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original SSN Escrow Account and
provided that use and/or release of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as
applied to the original SSN Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into
which SSN Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be a SSN Escrow Account. Receipt by the
Trustee from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall


-----

constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the SSN Escrowed Property from the original
Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will notify the Authority that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any
relevant details relating to such special mandatory redemption.

**The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

The Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis: (i) on the Issue Date, by the
Parent (the “Parent Guarantor,” and such guarantee provided, the “Initial Senior Secured Notes
**Guarantee”), and (ii) subject to the Agreed Security Principles, as soon as reasonably practicable after the**
Completion Date and in any event within the date that is 150 days from the Completion Date, by the Target and
its material subsidiaries (the “Target Guarantors” and, together with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors,”
and, such guarantees provided, the “Target Senior Secured Notes Guarantees” and, together with the Initial
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the “Senior Secured Notes Guarantees”). The Guarantors will grant the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and will also, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, guarantee the Senior
Facilities Agreement on a senior secured, pari passu basis.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the expected Target Guarantors will be the Target and TMobile Netherlands B.V.). For the year ended December 31, 2020, on an unconsolidated basis and without
giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other adjustments in relation to consolidation, the Target
Guarantors (expected to be the Target and T-Mobile Netherlands) represented (i) 92.1% of the Target Group’s
net revenue and (ii) 94.3% of the Target Group’s EBITDA. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, on
an unconsolidated basis and without giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other adjustments in
relation to consolidation, the Target Guarantors represented (i) 90.3% of the Target Group’s net revenue, and
(ii) 103.0% of the Target’s Group EBITDA, which is higher than the consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group
for nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to negative EBITDA of some of non-Target
Guarantor entities for this period. As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, after giving effect to
intercompany eliminations attributable to share capital but not to other adjustments in relation to consolidation,
the Target Guarantors represented 117.0% and 130.0%, respectively, of the Target Group’s total assets, which
are higher than the consolidated total assets of the Target Group for the relevant periods due to the negative
value of total assets at some of the non-Target Guarantor entities as a result of intercompany position relating
to operations of these entities with the Target Guarantors, whereby, prior to consolidation, their liabilities
exceed their assets.

In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Senior
_Secured Notes Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior Secured Notes_
Guarantee in the future. The term “Senior Secured Notes Guarantees” or “Guarantors” shall also be deemed to
refer to any such future additional Guarantee or Guarantees that may be granted from time to time in accordance
with the Indenture.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among others, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, justified corporate
interest (where applicable), fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and
similar matters. See “—Security—Summary of Agreed Security Principles.”

Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render
the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the
United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required
under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By
virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See “Certain Insolvency Law

_Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and Security—Insolvency Law Considerations—The_
_Netherlands—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests.”_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company, and, therefore, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
will be dependent on cash flows from intercompany loans or other payments or distributions from its
subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. The Parent, which
is the direct parent company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, is also a holding company which was also
formed for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions and has no revenue generating operations of its own
and no material assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_the Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The Issuers are holding companies that do not have any_
_revenue generating operations of their own and depend on cash from operating companies to be able to make_
_payments on the Notes.”_

Not all of the subsidiaries of the Target will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. Claims of creditors
of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and
guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the
claims of creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including the Holders. The Senior
Secured Notes and each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
of the Parent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The Notes
_will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.”_

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor and, other than in the cases of clauses
(1), (2), (4) and (7) described below, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee given by the Parent, will terminate
and be released:

(1) upon the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger or
amalgamation) of ownership interests in the relevant Guarantor (directly or through a Holding
Company of such Guarantor) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the
sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or other
disposition does not violate the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(4) as described in the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantees”;_

(5) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below);

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant
consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation” and the Indenture;_

(8) with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor pursuant to
which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or a Guarantor;

(9) in the case of any Guarantor that is a Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, pursuant to the
provisions described below under “—IPO Pushdown”; or


-----

(10) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes.

At the request and expense of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and, if applicable, at the request of the
Security Agent, the Trustee shall take all reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release
or amendment of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions. Each of the releases
and amendments set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without any consent of the Holders or any
other action or consent on the part of the Trustee. The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request
and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such release complies with the Indenture, without
further inquiry, investigation, independent verification or liability of any kind.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, the applicable perfection
requirements and Permitted Collateral Liens, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis
by an English law charge over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s beneficial interest in the SSN Escrow Account.

On or around the Completion Date, the bank account charge over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
beneficial interest in the SSN Escrow Account will be released and replaced by:

- a Dutch law share pledge over the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

- a Dutch law bank account pledge over any material operating bank accounts of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer; and

- a Dutch law pledge over any material structural loan receivables owed to the Parent by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer

(such items collectively, the “Initial Collateral”).

In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Completion Date and in any event within 150
days from the Completion Date, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and to the Agreed Security Principles,
the applicable perfection requirements and Permitted Collateral Liens, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured on an equal and ratable first-priority basis by the following security
agreements: (1) a Dutch law share pledge over the shares in the Target (subject to the Security Agent and each
other finance party taking all action that is required to ensure that such security can be granted by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer in that time period), (2) in the case of each Target Guarantor incorporated in the
Netherlands, (a) security over any shares held by it in another Guarantor; (b) any material operating bank
accounts held by such Target Guarantor and (c) security over any material structural intercompany loans made
by it to another Guarantor and (3) in the case of any Target Guarantor that is incorporated in a jurisdiction that
is not The Netherlands but is designated a “Security Jurisdiction” for the purposes of the Senior Facilities
Agreement (a “Security Jurisdiction”), security over any shares held by it in another Guarantor (the “Post**Closing Target Collateral” and together with the Initial Collateral and any additional assets that may from**
time to time be subject to security in favour of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the “Collateral”).

In particular, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
applicable perfection requirements and Permitted Collateral Liens, each subsidiary of the Parent that accedes
to the Senior Facilities Agreement as a guarantor thereof after the Issue Date and grants security in connection
with such accession shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement, and security will be granted in favor of the Senior
Secured Notes over the assets that will secure borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement. The Collateral
will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other security
interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, any Senior


-----

Secured Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral shall be subject
to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, the applicable perfection requirements and any Permitted
Collateral Liens.

**_Summary of Agreed Security Principles_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets will not be pledged (or the Liens not perfected), or
guarantees given, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including:

- if providing such guarantee or security would be prohibited by general statutory or regulatory
limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, liquidity maintenance,
fraudulent preference, “controlled foreign corporation,” “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions,
retention of title claims and similar matters or providing security would be outside the applicable
pledgor’s legal capacity or conflict with fiduciary duties of directors, officers or other legal
representatives or contravene any legal prohibition, contractual restriction or regulatory condition or
cause material risk of personal or criminal liability, in each case, after the use of reasonable endeavors
to overcome such obstacle;

- if the cost of providing the guarantee or security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes;

- if there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets of a Guarantor in a
particular category of assets, only the material assets in that category will be subject to security;

- if it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over
certain categories of assets, security will not be taken over such assets;

- if providing such security requires consent before such assets may be secured or where providing such
security would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or
obligations of the Parent, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of their Subsidiaries in respect of
those assets or require any of them to take any action materially adverse to their interests and where
(subject to certain conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable
endeavors;

- if providing or perfecting such guarantee or security would have a material adverse effect (as
reasonably determined in good faith by such Subsidiary) on the ability of such Subsidiary to conduct
its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the indenture and any
requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any
other action shall be subject to this principle;

- if the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes relating to the provision of the
guarantee or security are material;

- if the assets are, or the relevant member of the Group is, located outside the security jurisdiction, being
the Netherlands and any other jurisdiction later designated as such pursuant to the Senior Facilities
Agreement;

- in the case of any guarantee or security from or over, or over assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any entity (other than the Parent) that is not wholly-owned; and

- in the case of assets subject to security in favor of a third party.

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any Operating
Facilities (as defined and designated pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement), and certain hedging agreements.
Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the Parent is permitted to_
grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral will be applied pro
_rata in payment of all liabilities in respect of obligations under the indenture and the Senior Secured Notes and_
any other Indebtedness of the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and secured by the
Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement that is not subordinated in right of payment
to the Senior Secured Notes, including borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging
liabilities. In the future, pursuant to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, the lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and/or counterparties to certain hedging agreements and any Additional Notes may also
benefit from security which does not secure the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under
or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and Security” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Each Guarantee is_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. In addition, in
certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the
secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law or before courts in certain of these
jurisdictions. The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the
Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to
various bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s
bankruptcy. In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount required
under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As
a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes,
or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See “—The Senior
_Secured Notes Guarantees,” “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees_
_and Security” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—_
_Relating to Each Series of Notes—Dutch insolvency laws may provide you with less protection than bankruptcy_
_laws of other jurisdictions you are familiar with.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and
any other Collateral provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely
operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds
from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes, the payment of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations
and any other Indebtedness of the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and secured by
the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. By its nature, some or all of the
Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The Notes are_


-----

_secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted or will be granted as security for_
_the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes_
_and the Guarantees.”_

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability
of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements
that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed
by a valuation. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Trustee for the Senior Secured Notes has, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have:

- irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to
which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other
incidental rights, power and discretions and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee
and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the Collateral as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and other future indebtedness, (b) the counterparties under certain hedging arrangements, (c) the
Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture and (d) the creditors of certain other
Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, including holders of the Senior Notes, is established by
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which provide that the obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, such hedging arrangements and such permitted or
other future Indebtedness will receive proceeds of enforcement of security over the Collateral equally and
ratably on a first priority basis, and certain other creditors, such as holders of the Senior Notes, will receive
proceeds of enforcement over that portion of the Collateral pursuant to which they are also secured only after
those obligations secured on a first priority basis are satisfied in full. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional_
Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other
Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—
_Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent will take any action necessary and reasonably required by, and at the cost of, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral required by a Security Document in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes issued under the Indenture or satisfaction and discharge or defeasance thereof in accordance
with the Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;


-----

(3) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person
other than the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant_
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is
otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, as described in the second paragraph of the covenant
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(6) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) with respect to assets held by or the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in connection with a
solvent liquidation of such Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of
such Restricted Subsidiary remain owned by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor;

(9) if on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture, including under the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary,
the Trustee, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Agent and the Trustee
shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and, at its option, an Opinion of Counsel,
certifying which circumstances give rise to the release of Collateral and that such release complies with the
Indenture.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries and any other Collateral provider may
also, among others, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course
activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation, (i) selling, pledging or otherwise
disposing of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien under the
Security Documents which has become worn out, defective or obsolete or not used or useful in the business,
(ii) selling, pledging, transferring or otherwise disposing of current assets in the ordinary course of business and
(iii) any other action permitted by the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event of a conflict between the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the
request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, enter into with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives), one or
more intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification
of the Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially the same terms
as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes as compared to the Intercreditor Agreement) and substantially similar as applies to sharing of
the proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security; _provided_ that such


-----

Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent or adversely affect the personal rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or
the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used herein, a reference to the
Intercreditor Agreement will also include any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; _provided, that such transaction would comply with the_
covenant described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
without the consent of holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time
to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to (1) cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any
such Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the Parent or the Restricted Subsidiaries that are subject
to any such Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the
Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure
the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision to implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens or to implement a pushdown in relation to an IPO Event in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture or (6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of
Senior Secured Notes in any material respect.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into
any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—
_Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior Secured_
Notes Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the
Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered
into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s
behalf.

**IPO Pushdown**

(1) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be entitled
to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the
terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis that:
(i) references to the Parent and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to
the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;
(ii) all financial ratio, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Holding Company
of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO
Pushdown Entity; (iii) each reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Parent” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO
Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise, and _provided_
_further that nothing in this clause (1), including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-clause_
(iii) and any action taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Parent, shall,
or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other
term in the indenture or a Default or an Event of Default); (iv) none of the representations, warranties,
undertakings, covenants or Events of Default in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the
IPO Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no


-----

event, matter or circumstance relating to any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether
in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute
or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default;
(vi) each Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by any such Holding Company; (vii) unless
otherwise notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer: (A) each person which is party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor” shall be
irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) (and from the date specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
that person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor and shall have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor) and (B) there shall be no
obligation or requirement for any person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor and (viii) in the event that any person is released
from or does not become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor as a consequence of this clause (1), any term of the indenture and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that
any person be an Investor or that any liabilities or obligations to such person be subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall
cease to apply. A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could be deemed to arise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this provision).

(2) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture or
amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or the Security Documents required by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and/or take such
other action as is required by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the
matters contemplated by clause (1) above; _provided that such amendment, replacement or other_
document or instrument does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent
or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent (as applicable), does not affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent (as applicable) under such
amendment, replacement or other document or instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are
each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to
execute any such amended or replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the
Holders (and shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer).

(3) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Parent notified to the Trustee by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in writing as the person to be
treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event, _provided that the IPO_
Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent which will issue shares, or whose shares
are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a Holding Company of such Restricted Subsidiary), and
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be a Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer or the applicable
successor to the Senior Notes Issuer (in each case, either before or after giving effect to the anticipated
IPO Event).

(4) If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee and Security Agent
pursuant to clause (1) above in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that
Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the
Trustee and Security Agent. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this
clause (4): (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (1)(i) to (1)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation
to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to clause (1) above in reliance
on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a
replacement Security Document in respect of that security and (iii) if any person party to the


-----

Intercreditor Agreement as an “Investor” has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant
to sub-clause (1)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that person shall as soon as
reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as an Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this clause (4) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO
Event and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly
constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or a Default or an Event of Default
(whether by reason of any action or step taken by any person, or any matter or circumstance arising or
committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and
“—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Senior Secured Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer.

At any time prior to  , 2024, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes
at its option, upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes, plus the relevant Applicable Premium as of, and accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date.

At any time prior to  , 2024, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem at its option, upon not less
than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, during each 12 month period commencing after the Issue Date, up
to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes in every 12 month period, commencing
on the Issue Date (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes forming part of the
same series as the Senior Secured Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount redeemed
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after  , 2024, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem
the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at its option, upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, at a redemption price equal to the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the
Senior Secured Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date if redeemed during the
periods beginning on   of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2024 .............................................................................................................................................................. %
2025 .............................................................................................................................................................. %
2026 and thereafter ....................................................................................................................................... 100.00000%

At any time and from time to time prior to   , 2024, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may, at its
option, on any one or more occasions redeem Senior Secured Notes issued under the Indenture with the Net
Cash Proceeds received by the Parent from any Equity Offering, upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’
prior notice, at a redemption price equal to   % of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption
date in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including any Additional Notes forming part of the same series
as the Senior Secured Notes), as the case may be, provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and


-----

(2) not less than 50% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including any
Additional Notes forming part of the same series as the Senior Secured Notes) issued under the
Indenture remains outstanding after each such redemption.

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion of any such
Equity Offering.

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. Any
redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence
of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or any other transaction). In addition, if such redemption or notice is
subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, at the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall
be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed;
_provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the_
date on which such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may provide in
such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes,
including a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if
Holders of Senior Secured Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable
outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender
offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, purchases, all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
Holders, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than ten nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem
the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer,
plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Parent, its direct and indirect equity holders, including the Initial
Investors and Parent Holding Companies, Subsidiaries of the Company and any of their respective Affiliates
and members of our management may acquire at any time and from time to time our outstanding debt securities
or loans, including the Senior Secured Notes, by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open
market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, and such purchases may be at prices below par. The
amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any
such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of the Senior Notes or another series of debt, with
the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer effects an optional redemption of any series of the Senior Secured
Notes, it will, if and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, if
and to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, inform the Authority of such optional redemption and
confirm the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes that will remain
outstanding immediately after such redemption.

**Sinking Fund**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments, except
as set out under “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes.


-----

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the
Registrar, as applicable, will select the Senior Secured Notes for redemption in compliance with the
requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Secured Notes are listed, as
certified to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar, as applicable, by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
and in compliance with the requirements and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream (as applicable), or if the
Senior Secured Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Senior
Secured Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribe no method
of selection, on a _pro rata_ basis by use of a pool factor; _provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in_
aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Secured Notes in integral multiples
of €1,000 will be redeemed. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will be
liable to any person for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

Notices of redemption (other than in connection with a Special Mandatory Redemption) will be
delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least ten days but not more than 60 days before the
redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing
in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a
portion of the original Senior Secured Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation
of the original Senior Secured Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such
Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion
thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein),
Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest
will cease to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of them called for redemption on the applicable
redemption date

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem at its discretion the Senior Secured Notes of a series in
whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders
(which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together
with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for redemption (a
“Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—
_Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of_
the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor determine in good faith
that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, rulings or protocols
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, rulings or protocols (including a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of
the Senior Secured Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying


-----

Agent where this would be reasonable but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes). In the case of redemption due to withholding or deduction as a result of a
Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of this Offering
Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of this Offering
Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law
in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such
Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will
be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be
obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes were
then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains
in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an
Officer’s Certificate stating that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or its successor, where applicable, is entitled
to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right
so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of a tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, is or would become obligated
to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be able
to rely absolutely and without further inquiry on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence
of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will
be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the Senior
Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required
by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee is made by the Payor or its agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental
Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a
resident or engaged in business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental
Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”),**

will at any time be required from any payments made by or on behalf of a Payor with respect to any
Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price,
premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the
“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments
by each Holder after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such
Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in respect of
such payments on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; _provided,_ _however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on_
account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note or Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over, the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial
owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of,
incorporated in, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being


-----

physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection
arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof, or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or
beneficial owner, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or
satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, such Taxes, provided in each
case the Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended
or successor version that is substantially comparable), any agreements entered into pursuant to
Section 1471(b) of the Code and any intergovernmental agreements (and related legislation or official
administrative guidance) implemented with respect to the foregoing;

(6) any Taxes imposed or withheld in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment
(where presentation is permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial
owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Senior Secured Note
to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent;

(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to The Netherlands Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet
_bronbelasting 2021); or_

(8) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without
such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Senior Secured Note for
payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment
was first made available for payment to the beneficiary or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Senior
Secured Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional
Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (8) inclusive above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a
fiduciary or a partnership or limited liability company or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Senior
Secured Note to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such
partnership or limited liability company or the beneficial owner of such payment or Senior Secured Note would
not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held
such Senior Secured Note directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary
course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and will provide such
certified copies to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the
Holders upon written request. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the


-----

amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect
of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per €1,000
principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect
to any payment made on any Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to
the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate
stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information
necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date
(unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date,
in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is
30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such
Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in either the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or this “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes” there are mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as
described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would
be payable in respect thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or
any other property or similar taxes, charges or levies, that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto
(other than in connection with a transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes), and the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes paid by such Holders.

The foregoing obligations of this “Withholding Taxes” section will survive any termination,
defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Guarantor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered
to be a resident or engaged in business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party
makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make an
offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to €100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may
only be purchased in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control
**Offer”) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and**
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days
following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be
delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Secured
Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute


-----

the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified
purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than ten days and no later than
60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and
described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a
Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in the Indenture by compliance therewith. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may rely on
any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement
action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior
Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer will mail a notice of the Change of Control Offer to each Holder of any such Senior
Secured Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has
the right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes
at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders
of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of
**Control Payment”);**

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control Triggering Event;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, consistent with the
Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that
the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering
Event.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have
occurred, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been
tendered to and purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and


-----

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and
to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Parent will notify the Authority of any Change of
Control Offer .

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does
not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or
redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control
Triggering Event may require prepayment and cancellation or other consequences in respect of the Senior
Facilities Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries
may also contain prohibitions on, or entail consequences arising from, certain events which would constitute a
Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or
repaid upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the
Holders of their right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could
cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering
Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes following
the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources.
Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change
of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make
more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The
Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers
and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer could, in the future, enter
into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute
a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to
Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the_
Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture
will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the
times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior
Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless
and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the
redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable
redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer
may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty
as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the


-----

Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether
a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and the decision whether to make an offer to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes as described above will in such circumstance be made in the good faith judgment of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation to make
an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be
waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness), _provided that the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur_

thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 or the Relevant Total Leverage Ratio is not
greater than 7.00 to 1.00.

Indebtedness shall not otherwise be subject to any limit set out in this clause (1));

Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary and
(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the
Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in clauses
(1) and (3) of this paragraph) of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date

(including an acquisition of assets and any capital expenditure); provided that, with respect to each of
(a) and (b) of this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition or other transaction the aggregate principal
amount of such Indebtedness Incurred did not exceed (i) an amount which, when taken together with
any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this sub-clause (i) and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, this covenant:

(1) in the event that all or any portion of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Parent, in its sole
discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one
of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; _provided that all_
Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes on the
Issue Date shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant (and
not clause (4)(a)) and may not be reclassified pursuant to this clause;

(2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph
above or clause (1), (8), (10) or (11) of the second paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(6) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(7) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of that
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary or otherwise used to pay the
aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with any such
refinancing, replacement, exchange, renewal, extension or other action; and

(8) with respect to any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a clause limited by reference to a fixed euro
amount in the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time that the Parent would be entitled to
have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall, unless otherwise elected by the Parent, be automatically
reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock
or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant (provided that the amount of
any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (if elected by the Parent) be
increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount
and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be deemed
to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such


-----

Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred). The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any
date shall be calculated as specified under the definition of “Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent as of such date.

In the case of any revolving facility or similar or equivalent arrangement, when calculating compliance
with this covenant the Parent shall be entitled to calculate Consolidated EBITDA (and/or, where applicable,
any other definition, ratio or test) at the time the relevant commitments are obtained (without any further
requirement to calculate compliance at the time such commitments are utilized).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on its currency equivalent at the Relevant Test Date, provided that (a) if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness
does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, (b) the Euro Equivalent
of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the currency equivalent of such amount on the Issue Date and (c) if and for so long as any such
Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is
denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if
denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency
Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which
is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall
be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to:

market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any noncash Restricted Payment shall be determined as described under the definition of “fair market value.” Any
amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the

or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would
otherwise constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event, (2) the purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of
such Net Cash Proceeds or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio


-----

of the Parent so that there would not be an occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event that would have
occurred without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of
Control Offer is made in connection with such event in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the restrictions set out under “—Permitted Debt
_Payments,” nothing in this covenant shall prohibit any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, repurchase,_
redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of, any Senior Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or
Senior Parent Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall prohibit the roll up or
capitalization of any amount due in respect of New Equity or Subordinated Shareholder Funding.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien,
in each case, on the Deposit Account, except for the benefit of the Holders or as set forth under clause (11) of
the definition of Permitted Liens.

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien, in each case, to secure any Indebtedness, upon any of its assets (including
Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that
date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such
Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (1) in the case of any asset that does not constitute Collateral, (a) Permitted
Liens or (b) Liens on assets that are not Permitted Liens if, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior
Secured Notes and the Indenture (or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens in respect of a
Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is
so secured and (2) in the case of any asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the
Indenture pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged (i) upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise
as set forth under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or
under the relevant Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of
such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or a Guarantor to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual
encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Parent;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Parent; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Parent,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of


-----

(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility, the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in
effect at or entered into on the Issue Date or on any applicable date on which any Permitted Collateral
Lien securing the Senior Secured Notes is granted;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person
was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of
assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant
to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Parent or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into
or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes
of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Parent
or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred
to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); _provided that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such_
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Parent);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under
the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the
property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;
or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on
the property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that
imposes restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its assets) imposed
pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or


-----

substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the assets that are subject
to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to
the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement
and the Intercreditor Agreement, together with the Security Documents associated therewith as in
effect on the Issue Date, or those contained in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) in
comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Parent) or where either (x) the Parent
determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Parent’s ability to make principal or interest payments on
the Senior Secured Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance
of a default relating to such agreement or instrument;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on
_Liens”; or_

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Receivables Facility
that, in the good faith determination of the Parent, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified
Receivables Financing or such Receivables Facility.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by
any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to
the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to
such Asset Disposition) of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap); and

(2) an amount equal to the Required Percentage (as defined below) of the Net Available Cash from such
Asset Disposition is directly or indirectly applied by the Parent or any relevant Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required
by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase
any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary) (“Non-Guarantor Debt”), Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
Indebtedness constituting Senior Lender Liabilities, SSN Liabilities or Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities and/or Indebtedness Incurred under clauses (1), (15) and/or (16) of the


-----

second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (or in each
case any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 548 days from the later of
(A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;
_provided that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness_
pursuant to this clause (a), where applicable, the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary will
retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except in the case of
any revolving Indebtedness, including, but not limited to, the Revolving Facility, asset-based
facility, guarantee facility or other similar or equivalent arrangement) to be permanently
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased, (ii) to
prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the
principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest (together
with any applicable prepayment or redemption premiums) to the date of such prepayment,
repayment or purchase; or

(b) to the extent the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest
in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Parent or another Restricted
Subsidiary) or otherwise in the business of the Group, including any capital expenditure,
within 548 days from the later of (x) the date of such Asset Disposition and (y) the receipt of
such Net Available Cash; _provided that (i) any such reinvestment made pursuant to a_
definitive binding agreement or a commitment that is executed or approved within such time
and (ii) any such reinvestment designated by the Parent within such time, will satisfy this
requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within twelve calendar months of
such 548th day; and/or

(c) to the extent the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, in or towards any payment
(whether by way of dividend, distribution, loan, repayment or otherwise), transaction or other
arrangement (including, without limitation, any payments or other transactions or
arrangements of a type contemplated by the covenant described herein under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments;” within 548 days from the later of (A) the_
date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, provided that
the Relevant Total Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to that payment
does not exceed 5.50 to 1.00; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided, further, that (1) pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance_
with clause (a) through (d) above, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture and
(2) the Parent (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets or
otherwise in the business of the Group prior to receiving the Net Available Cash attributable to any given Asset
Disposition and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above
with respect to such Asset Disposition.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested, committed or
designated to be applied or invested as provided for in clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be
deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 549th day after an Asset Disposition, or at
such earlier date that the Parent elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds
the greater of (x) €280,000,000 and (y) 40% of LTM EBITDA and has not been committed in accordance with
clauses (2)(b) or (2)(c) of the first paragraph of this covenant (or if so committed, has not been applied or
invested in accordance with such commitment within the relevant period), the Parent will be required to make
an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Senior Secured Notes issued under the Indenture and,
to the extent the Parent elects, to holders of all or any other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
the maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to
which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds,
at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, at an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and


-----

100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest
(together with any applicable prepayment or redemption premiums), if any, to, but not including, the date of
repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the
agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes,
in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Parent may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the terms of
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered by holders or lenders, collectively,
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate
principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating
the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be
calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a
date selected by the Parent that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be deemed to be reset at zero.
To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or Pari
Passu Indebtedness is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured
Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of tendered Senior
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which
such Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness are denominated that is actually received by the Parent
or a Restricted Subsidiary upon converting such portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a
period of not less than five Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer
**Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the**
“Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Parent will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent they elect, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be
repaid, prepaid or purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than
the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Parent will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Senior Secured
Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Parent
will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof
were accepted for payment by the Parent in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Parent or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of
the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Senior Secured Notes an amount
equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such
Holder, and accepted by the Parent for purchase, and the Parent will promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note
(or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s
Certificate from the Parent, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such
new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion
of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; _provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in an_
aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred
by book entry) by the Parent to the Holder thereof.


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no requirement to offer to apply any Excess Proceeds in
prepayment of the Revolving Facility.

For the purpose of this covenant, “Required Percentage” shall mean:

(1) if at the time of application the Relevant Leverage Ratio (adjusted to give effect to any relevant
purchase, prepayment and/or other application assuming that all relevant holders of Indebtedness
accept that prepayment and/or other application) is greater than 4.50 to 1.00, 100%;

(2) if at the time of application the Relevant Leverage Ratio (adjusted as if any relevant prepayment and/or
other application had taken place on the last day of the relevant measurement period and assuming that
all relevant holders of Indebtedness accept that prepayment and/or other application) is greater than
4.25 to 1.00 but less than or equal to 4.50 to 1.00, 50%; and

(3) if at the time of application the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (adjusted as if any relevant
prepayment and/or other application had taken place on the last day of the relevant measurement period
and assuming that all relevant holders of Indebtedness accept that prepayment and/or other application)
is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.00, 0%.

For the avoidance of doubt, any amount of Net Available Cash from any Asset Disposition which is
not required to be applied in accordance with clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant above as a result
of such amount being in excess of the Required Percentage or otherwise shall not constitute Excess Proceeds
and may be used for any other purpose not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

The Parent will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior
Secured Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the
Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict
with provisions of this covenant, the Parent will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or
exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any
conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into
any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Parent (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate value in excess of 10% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Parent
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(x) €70,000,000 and (y) 20% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by
a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Parent.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) (a) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payment or any Permitted Investment and (b) any_
transaction contemplated or permitted under the covenant described under “—Permitted Debt
_Payments”;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,


-----

agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements to purchase Capital Stock of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Holding
Company restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or
arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Parent, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances, any transaction pursuant to or in connection with an MIP, incentive
scheme or similar arrangement (including any MIP Payment) and any waiver or transaction with
respect thereto;

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries
and (b) any Permitted Reorganization;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or
any Parent Holding Company (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned
or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for
purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, including without
limitation the Transaction Documents, as these agreements and instruments may be amended,
modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the
other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect, the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in
connection with any Public Offering, and the performance of any agreement, the entry into which
satisfies the requirements of this covenant;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and
maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes
in the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each
case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary
in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the Senior Management of the Parent or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably
have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Parent or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely because the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Parent or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; or (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction
with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the
Indenture;

(11) (a) payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly, including through any Parent Holding Company) of fees and/or expenses in an aggregate
amount not to exceed in each fiscal year the greater of €35,000,000 and 5% of LTM EBITDA; and
(b) customary payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether
directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Holding Company) for financial advisory,


-----

consulting, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking
activities, including in connection with acquisitions, divestitures or exits;

(12) (a) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred or payable by
such Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including any Parent Holding Company Expenses; and (b) payment of reasonable fees
and costs for non-executive directors of the Parent who are nominees of Investors if the amount of
those fees and costs does not exceed the greater of €35,000,000 and 5% of LTM EBITDA in aggregate
in any Financial Year;

(13) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Receivables Facility;

(14) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in
connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or entered into with
any Business Successor, in each case, that the Parent determines in good faith is either fair to the Parent
or otherwise on customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar transactions;
and

(15) transactions in which the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Parent
or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause (1) of
the preceding paragraph.

**_Permitted Debt Payments_**

Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, unless otherwise contemplated or permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement the Parent may not, and shall procure that no other member of the Group will repay,
prepay, purchase, defease, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire the principal amount of any Second Lien
Financing or Senior Parent Financing (but, for the avoidance of doubt, in each case excluding any amount
outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement) prior to its scheduled maturity date in any manner which
involves the payment of cash consideration by a member of the Group to a person which is not a member of the
Group (a “Permitted Debt Payment”).

The previous paragraph shall not prohibit any Permitted Debt Payment provided that: (i) such
Permitted Debt Payment is funded directly or indirectly with Available Shareholder Amounts, New Equity
(other than the Equity Contribution), Subordinated Shareholder Funding, Cash Overfunding (to the extent not
already designated by the Parent for another specific purpose under the Indenture), and/or the proceeds of any
Second Lien Financing or Senior Parent Financing, or any amount made available under or pursuant to an
additional facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement; (ii) such Permitted Debt Payment constitutes or is
otherwise part of a refinancing or replacement of any Second Lien Financing or Senior Parent Financing not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including pursuant to a debt
exchange, non-cash rollover or other similar or equivalent transaction); (iii) such Permitted Debt Payment is
made in accordance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;
(iv) such Permitted Debt Payment is made following the occurrence of a Change of Control (provided that the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not in breach of any obligation to make a payment under the provisions described
under “—Change of Control” at the time such Permitted Debt Payment is contractually committed); (v) at the
time such Permitted Debt Payment is contractually committed the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for the
Relevant Period ending on the most recent Quarter Date for which internal consolidated financial statements
are available is equal to or less than 4.25:1 (adjusted as if such Permitted Debt Payment and any resulting or
related reduction in Consolidated Net Indebtedness had taken place on the last day of that Relevant Period);
(vi) such Permitted Debt Payment is made pursuant to this sub-paragraph (vi), provided that the aggregate
amount of all Permitted Debt Payments made pursuant to and in reliance on this sub-paragraph (vi) may not
exceed the greater of €210,000,000 and 30% of LTM EBITDA or (vii) such Permitted Debt Payment is made
under or pursuant to any provision of a Transaction Document equivalent or similar to those provisions relating
to repayment due to illegality of a lender, rights of cancellation of lenders or replacement of lenders, including,


-----

without limitation, any Permitted Debt Payment to a non-consenting lender, a non-funding lender or an
increased costs lender under the relevant Transaction Document.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Parent will provide to the Trustee the
following reports:

(1) within 150 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Parent ending after the Issue Date, annual
reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Parent as of the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated
income statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent for the most two recent fiscal years,
including customary footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors
on the financial statements, provided that in respect of any period commencing prior to the Issue Date,
the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target may be provided in place of the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Parent; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information
and balance sheet information of the Parent (to the extent pro forma information has not previously
been provided by the Parent, and which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of
a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt the Acquisition itself); (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and
capital resources of the Parent, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and
critical accounting policies, with a similar scope to that included in this Offering Memorandum; (d) a
description of the business, management and shareholders of the Parent, all material affiliate
transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt
instruments and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days after the end of each of the Parent’s first three fiscal quarters in each financial year (or
90 days in the case of the first such fiscal quarter after the Issue Date), all quarterly reports containing
the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Parent as of
the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow of the Parent for
the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and
the comparable prior year period of the Parent, together with condensed footnote disclosure, provided
that in respect of any period commencing prior to the Issue Date, the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of the Target may be provided in place of the unaudited consolidated financial statements
of the Parent; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of
the Parent (to the extent pro forma information has not previously been provided by the Parent, which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet
to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant
quarter (other than, for the avoidance of doubt the Acquisition itself); (c) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations,
financial condition, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Parent, and
a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course of business in commitments and
contingencies since the most recent report and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior
executive officer changes at the Parent or change in auditors of the Parent or any other material event
that the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary announces publicly, a report containing a description of
such event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS
as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect);
_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in_
applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as provided for in this


-----

covenant, no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Parent. The filing of
an Annual Report on Form 20-F within the time period specified in clause (1) will satisfy such provision so
long as such report is also provided to the Trustee. At the Parent’s election it may also comply with the
provisions of this covenant by including financial statements of a Parent Holding Company of the Parent or
those of the Target (as applicable) in lieu of those for the Parent and as if references to the Parent above were
to such Parent Holding Company or the Target; _provided that, if the financial statements of such a Parent_
Holding Company or the Target (as applicable) are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of
material differences between the financial statements of such Parent Holding Company or the Target (as
applicable) and the Parent shall be included in such respect for any period commencing after the Issue Date.
During any period in which the Capital Stock of the Parent, the Target or a Parent Holding Company is listed
on a recognized stock exchange, the requirements of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled for
all purposes if the Parent, the Target or such Parent Holding Company (as applicable) complies with the
reporting requirements of such stock exchange.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if and only
if the entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 25% of the Parent’s pro forma adjusted
EBITDA as of and for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Parent, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses
(1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, either in the
financial statements or in a supplement thereto, of (i) the financial condition and results of operations of the
Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries or (ii) the financial condition and results of operations of such Unrestricted Subsidiary
or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise).

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports or statement specified in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph or the second paragraph of this covenant, the Parent shall also
(a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports or statement on such website as
may be then maintained by the Parent and its Subsidiaries, which may be password protected or (ii) otherwise
to provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the Parent in good faith) or
(b) to the extent the Parent determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports or statement available in
the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially
reasonable efforts, furnish such reports or statement to the Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers
of the Senior Secured Notes. The Parent will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses
(1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed
on the Official List of the Exchange, in the manner required by the Authority.

In addition, so long as the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and during any period during
which the Parent is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b), the Parent shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the
Senior Secured Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for
information purposes, and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any information
contained therein, including the Parent’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Parent_

Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor the Parent will consolidate with or merge with or into, or
convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:


-----

(1) either the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Parent is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving
or transferee Person (the “Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer” in the case of such a transaction
involving the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the “Successor Company” in the case of such a
transaction involving the Parent) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member
state of the European Union, the United Kingdom or the United States of America, any state or
commonwealth of the United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province
of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer (if not the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer) or the Successor Company (if not the Parent), as the case may be, will expressly
assume (in each case subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Indenture or of the Parent under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, as the case may be and (b) all
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Security Documents (and, to the extent
required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Successor Company or any Subsidiary of
the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Successor Company, as applicable, as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Successor
Company, as applicable, or such Subsidiary of the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Successor
Company, as applicable, at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing;

(3) on the Relevant Testing Date, either (a) the Parent or the Successor Company would be able to Incur
at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness;” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; or (c) the Relevant Leverage Ratio
of the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be greater than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or the Parent or the
Successor Company, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the
effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) complies
with the Indenture, and that all conditions precedent provided for therein relating to such transaction
have been complied with or satisfied, and that the assumption (if any) of obligations under clause
(1) above constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Successor Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or the Successor Company, as applicable. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on
such Officer’s Certificate without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is
deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any
such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect
thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

For the purpose of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Parent, which properties
and assets, if held by the Parent instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Parent on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent.

The Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Successor Company, as the case may be, will
succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or the Parent, as the case may be, under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its
assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes.


-----

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in
this sentence) and, other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph and clause (4) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Parent, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate
or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted
Subsidiary and (c) the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding
the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Parent, as the case may be, may consolidate or otherwise combine with or
merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or the Parent, as applicable, reincorporating the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Parent,
as the case may be, in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the
Parent, as the case may be.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Guarantor that is a Subsidiary of the Parent (a “Subsidiary Guarantor”) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(A) the other Person is the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a
Guarantor concurrently with the transaction); or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes (in each case subject to any limitations
contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) all of the obligations of the
Guarantor under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and the Security Documents
(and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement); and

(1) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is
continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B) and the provisions described above under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence),_
(a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of
its properties and assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Subsidiary Guarantor
and (c) the Subsidiary Guarantors may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2)
(which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate
or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor reincorporating the Subsidiary Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or
changing the legal form of the Subsidiary Guarantor.


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantees_**

The Parent will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor (other
than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer), directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Senior
Facilities Agreement (or any other Credit Facility that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or any Public Debt, in whole or in part, unless,
in each case, but subject to the Agreed Security Principles, such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on
the date on which such other Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, which Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be senior to or pari
passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee.

Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set
forth under “—The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees.” A Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor
may also be released at the option of the Parent if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such
Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a
Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Parent to effectuate any release of a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

Each such additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain
defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent shall not be obligated to cause any Restricted Subsidiary to
Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of
applicable law or regulation; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings
required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection with,
such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, which in any case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph
cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or (4) an
inconsistency with the Intercreditor Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles. The validity and
enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the security interests with respect to the Collateral
and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—_
_Each Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_


-----

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take any action that would have
the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of
the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to
the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Parent shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and
the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any Lien over any of the Collateral
that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens”; provided that the Parent and any Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “—
_Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred,_
used up, subject to wear or damage, or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien
in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Security
Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) to (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the
Collateral; (iv) undertake a Permitted Reorganization or Permitted Tax Restructuring or (v) make any other
change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided that (except where
permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted
Collateral Liens for the benefit of the Security Agent and holders of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance
with the Indenture), no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated or otherwise modified
or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets),
unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement or modification or release
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Parent
delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or
investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the
same asset), (2) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person
which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related
to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release, or (3) an Opinion of
Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the
Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or released and replaced
are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement and to which the new Indebtedness
secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Parent, the Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to
such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized
under the following captions will not apply to such Senior Secured Notes: “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted_


-----

_Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,”_
“—Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantees,” “—Permitted Debt Payments” and the provisions of clause
(3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured
_Notes Issuer and the Parent,” and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be_
effective and will not be applicable to the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related
default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event
ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not be of any effect with regard to actions of the Parent properly
taken during the continuance of a Suspension Event and no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by
reason of an Applicable Transaction made during the continuance of a Suspension Event. On the Reversion
Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of a Suspension Event will be classified, at the Parent’s
option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such_
Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to
Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such
Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue
Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The Parent shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this
covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the
covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of such event.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note when
due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in any payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
issued under the Indenture within 5 Business Days from its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption,
upon required repurchase, including pursuant to the extent required as described under “—Deposit of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” upon declaration or otherwise;_

(3) failure by the Parent or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice
by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with any other agreement or obligation contained in the
Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity
of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €350,000,000 or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Parent or a Significant Subsidiary
or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial


-----

statements for the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary
(the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Parent or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Parent and the Restricted
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess
of €350,000,000 (exclusive of any amounts covered by indemnities provided by a solvent insurance
company or that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are
not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the receipt of notice as described in the next
succeeding paragraph after such judgment becomes final and due, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such
judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value in
excess of €350,000,000 shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release or amendment of any such security interest in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
or such Security Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid
or unenforceable or the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security
interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 60 days (the “security default
**provisions”); and**

(8) any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Parent Guarantor or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in
full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor
denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and any such
Default continues for ten days (the “guarantee provisions”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
notify the Parent of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6), the Parent does not cure such default
within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

Notwithstanding any other term of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security
Document (i) no Permitted Reorganization and (ii) no Excluded Event, shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute,
or result in, a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or any Security
Document, or a Default or an Event of Default.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Parent or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Parent and the Trustee, may, and the
Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid
interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon
such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if
any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the
event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or
cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default
shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and
if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of
principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived. The Trustee
shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which


-----

is in fact such a Default or Event of Default is received by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate
Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior
Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the
part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note held
by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with
respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default
is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant
entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured, and any declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes resulting
therefrom shall be automatically annulled, upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or
such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified
in the Indenture.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under
the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
and, if requested, the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security and/or cost and fee cover (including by
way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability, fees or expense. Except to enforce the
right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to
the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity and/or cost and fee cover (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability, fees or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover (including by way of pre-funding);
and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.
The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a


-----

responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or
security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or
incurred by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of
such occurrence by the Parent, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being notified by the Parent. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any,
or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust
officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The
Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (or in the case of
the first fiscal year of the Parent ending after the Issue Date, within 150 days of the end thereof), an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year.
The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of
any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Parent
is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated (including by way of
pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the
Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action,
notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover (including by way of prefunding) to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Indenture
and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, such Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance
with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with
a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Senior Secured Notes); _provided that, if any_
amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend only one series of the Senior Secured Notes, only
the consent of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series shall
be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses
(8) and (9) below, 75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes affected,
an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Senior Secured Notes held by a nonconsenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Secured
Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);


-----

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change the time
at which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—
_Optional Redemption,” “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” or “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special_
_Mandatory Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Secured
Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of
principal of, or interest or Additional Amount, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior
Secured Notes on or after the due dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material respect or amend
the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any
of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes
so described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the covenant described under the heading “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the release of less than all or substantially all security_
interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require at
least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes)
and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for the Senior Secured Notes);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes
and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to
receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Parent, any Guarantor, the
Trustee and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Senior Secured
Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Parent or any Guarantor
under any Note Document;


-----

(3) provide for uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior Secured
Notes (provided that the uncertificated Senior Secured Notes are issued in registered form for purposes
of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Senior Secured Notes are
described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make
any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Senior Secured Notes)
that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Parent) for the issuance of
Additional Notes permitted under the Indenture;

(7) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in accordance
with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—
_Certain Covenants—Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantees,” to add Senior Secured Notes_
Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Senior
Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) with respect to or securing
the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the
requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement,
in any property which is required by the Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date)
to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to
the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person;
_provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor_
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants— Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and_
_Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; or_

(11) as provided in “—Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements.”_

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel in forms reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Senior
Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered
invalid by such tender. The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a
consent fee to Holders.


-----

**Acts by Holders**

A Senior Secured Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Parent, an Affiliate of the Parent,
or any fund or other entity controlled, managed or advised by any direct or indirect shareholder of the Parent
(or, in each case, any successor thereof) holds the Senior Secured Note; provided that in determining whether
the holders of the requisite majority of outstanding Senior Secured Notes have given any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Senior Secured Notes owned by the Parent or a
Restricted Subsidiary or Holding Company of the Parent (or, in each case, any successor thereof) shall be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding if a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice
of such ownership at least two Business Days prior to the date of such determination. Prior to the receipt of
such notice, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume that none of the Senior Secured Notes are owned by the
Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or Holding Company of the Parent (or in, each case, any successor thereof).
For the avoidance of doubt, provision of such notice shall not be an obligation of the Parent.

**Defeasance**

The Parent at any time may terminate all its, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and each Guarantor’s
obligations under any series of the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all
then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the
defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations
of the Parent, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each Guarantor in connection therewith and obligations
concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Parent exercises its legal defeasance option, the
Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust).

The Parent at any time may terminate its, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
obligations under the covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and
(2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured
_Notes Issuer and The Parent” and clause (A), (B) and (C) of the covenant described under “—Certain_
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and default_
provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the crossdefault upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the
Parent and its Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security
default provision described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Parent at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Parent exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
applicable series of Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect
to such Senior Secured Notes. If the Parent exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to any series
of the Senior Secured Notes, payment of such Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event
of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Parent” and
clauses (A), (B), (C) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—
_Subsidiary Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries (other than the Senior_
Secured Notes Issuer)), (7), (8) or (9) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Parent or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must
irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed
(as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations
or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes
to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery
to the Trustee of:


-----

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that beneficial
owners of the Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion
of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable
U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Parent or the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, as the case may be, with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring
any creditors of the Parent; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes and rights
of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when
(1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen
or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment was
previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Parent) have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are
to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Parent; (2) the Parent or the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), money in euro or European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Secured
Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the
date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity
or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Parent and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer have paid or caused
to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Parent or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (as the
case may be) has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited
money towards payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be;
and (5) the Parent has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel in forms
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and
_Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been_
complied with, _provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact_
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in writing by the Parent,
the Trustee and Paying Agent (which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption pursuant
to the above referenced Officer’s Certificate) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to
Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have
received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Parent of such earlier repayment date (which may be
included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior
to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Secured Notes are
represented by a global note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial
holders of such Senior Secured Notes holding interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be subject
to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel
in forms satisfactory to the Trustee without independent verification, provided that any such counsel may rely
on an Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact.


-----

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Incorporators and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, including the Target Group, shall have any liability for
any obligations of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Target
Group, under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not
be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a
waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Lucid Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such
Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received
written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use
the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of
the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty. Further, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under
the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has
received, customary protections and indemnification.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Parent, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect
of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee and any agent under the Indenture will be permitted to
engage in other transactions with the Parent and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Parent and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is
not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Parent
may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may
petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
taxes (other than taxes determined or measured by net income) and expenses incurred without gross negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
the Indenture. The right of the Trustee or the Security Agent to require an Opinion of Counsel shall not imply
that the Security Agent or Trustee should seek such an Opinion of Counsel and such Security Agent or Trustee
is entitled to rely on such other evidence as it deems appropriate. Each of the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall be entitled to rely solely and conclusively on any Officer’s Certificate in formulating its opinion or in
taking any action (including, without limitation, release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Collateral)
under the Indenture, and may rely on such Officer’s Certificate without need for investigation or verification
(including for the avoidance of doubt the receipt of Opinions of Counsel), except as may otherwise be expressly
required under the terms of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Senior Secured Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or
mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar.


-----

In addition, for so long as any of the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and if and for so long as the rules of Authority shall so require, the Company will notify the Authority
of any notice with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, each
of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests. In addition, for so long as any Senior
Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and
Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall
be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of BookEntry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the third day after
being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class
mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time
prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above,
it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given via Euroclear or
Clearstream, it will be deemed to have been duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or
Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Parent or any Guarantor for the payment of
principal, or premium, if any, or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed
five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
the Parent or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed three
years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for
the Senior Secured Notes to be admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no
assurance that the application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be
approved or that admission to trading in the Senior Secured Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of
the Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or admission.

**Currency Indemnity**

Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Parent,
any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder, any paying agent or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed
to be due to it in euro from the Parent or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Parent or such
Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the
amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient, any paying agent
or the Trustee under any Senior Secured Note, the Parent and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any
loss sustained by such recipient, any paying agent or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Parent and the
Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making
any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the
matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior Secured Note, any paying agent or the Trustee to certify in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to the Parent (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in
making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Parent’s
and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder, any paying agent or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the


-----

indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or
proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note, any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee or to the Trustee.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since, as of the Issue Date, substantially all the assets of each of the Parent, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Target Group are held by Subsidiaries located outside the United States, any judgment obtained
in the United States against the Parent, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any Guarantor, including judgments
with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.

The Netherlands does not have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final
judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil
liability would not be directly enforceable in the Netherlands. However, if the party in whose favor such final
judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in the Netherlands, such party may submit to a
Dutch court the final judgment that has been rendered in the United States. If the Dutch court finds that (a) the
jurisdiction of the court in the federal or state court in the United States has been based on grounds which are
internationally acceptable, (b) proper legal procedures have been observed, (c) the final judgment is —
according to the law of the jurisdiction of the court — formally capable of being enforced, (d) the final judgment
is not irreconcilable with a decision of a Dutch court rendered between the same parties or with an earlier
decision of a foreign court rendered between the same parties in proceedings involving the same cause, provided
that earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (e) the final judgment does not contravene public
policy in the Netherlands, the Dutch court will, in principle, give binding effect to the final judgment which has
been rendered in the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the Parent and each Guarantor will in the
Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in
the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, including any Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, and the
rights and duties of the parties thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The Security Documents will be governed
by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.

**Financial Calculations**

**_Financial Testing_**

The following principles relating to the calculation of financial metrics thereof are included in the
Indenture:

(a) For the purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA (and, where applicable, any other definition,
financial ratio or test) under the Indenture for any period, the Parent shall be permitted to: (i) if since
the beginning of such period the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary has disposed of or discontinued
any company, any business or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business (any
such disposition or discontinuation, for the purposes of this definition, a “Sale”) or if the transaction
giving rise to the need to calculate Consolidated EBITDA is such a Sale, calculate Consolidated
EBITDA for such period on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA will be reduced by an amount equal


-----

to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Sale
for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) attributable
thereto for such period, provided that if the Parent elects to make such an adjustment and the relevant
sale constitutes “discontinued operations” in accordance with IFRS, Consolidated Net Income shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if positive) attributable to such operations
for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if negative)
attributable thereto for such period; (ii) if since the beginning of such period, the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise) has made (or otherwise planned or committed, or in
respect of which any other step or action has been taken, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) an
Investment in any Person that thereby becomes (or that the Parent expects in good faith, based upon
any such plan, commitment, step or action, will become) a Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or
otherwise and including for this purpose any designation that results in an Unrestricted Subsidiary
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary), or otherwise has acquired (or that the Parent expects in good faith,
based upon any such plan, commitment, step or action, will acquire) any company, any business or
any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business (any such actual or potential Investment
or acquisition, a “Purchase”), including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a transaction
causing a calculation to be made under the Indenture, calculate Consolidated EBITDA on the basis
that Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as
if such Purchase (together with any other related action or step) occurred on the first day of such period;
(iii) in respect of any Sale or any Purchase by any Person (that became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
merged or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning
of such period, including for this purpose any Person that the Parent expects in good faith, based upon
any relevant plan, commitment, step or action referred to in paragraph (ii) above, will become a
Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise)) that would have permitted an adjustment pursuant to
paragraph (i) or (ii) above if made by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such
period, calculate Consolidated EBITDA on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA for such period will
be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Sale or Purchase (together with any other
related action or step) occurred on the first day of such period; (iv) include an adjustment in respect of
any Sale or Purchase (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Sale or Purchase contemplated by
paragraph (iii) above and any Sale or Purchase entered into in a prior period) equal to or less than the
full run rate effect of all Synergies which the Parent (acting reasonably and as calculated in good faith
by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of Group (or such other person as is performing
the functions of a financial or chief accounting officer)) believes can be obtained in the 36 month
period following that Sale or, as the case may be, Purchase as a result of such Sale or Purchase (or any
other related action or step); (v) if a definitive purchase agreement (including for this purpose any
launch of a public offer or similar or equivalent step) or other contract has been entered into in respect
of an acquisition or other Investment but that acquisition or other Investment has not yet occurred,
give pro forma effect to that acquisition or Investment; (vi) give pro forma effect to any Specified
Transaction (together with any other related action or step) that has occurred during or prior to such
period (or which is otherwise planned or committed, or in respect of which any other step or action
has been taken, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise); (vii) include an adjustment in respect of each
restructuring, cost saving, operating expense reduction, operating improvement (or, in each case, other
similar initiative) or other Specified Transaction (each, together with any other related action or step,
a “Group Initiative”) implemented during or prior to such period (or otherwise planned or committed,
or in respect of which any other step or action has been taken, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise)
equal to or less than the full run rate effect of all Synergies which the Parent (acting reasonably and as
calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of Group (or such other
person as is performing the functions of a financial or chief accounting officer)) believes can be
obtained in the 36 month period following implementation of such Group Initiative as a result of that
Group Initiative (or any other related action or step); (viii) exclude any non-recurring costs and other
expenses arising directly or indirectly as a consequence of any actual or potential Sale, Purchase or
Specified Transaction (or any other related action or step) and/or the implementation of (or any other
action or step in relation to) any Group Initiative and/or (ix) give pro forma effect to any exclusion,
add-back or other matter reflected in or contemplated by, or otherwise make any adjustment consistent
with or contemplated by, the Offering Memorandum (in each case as determined by the Parent in good
faith).


-----

(b) For the purpose of calculating the definitions set out in the Indenture: (i) all calculations will be as
determined in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of Group (or such other
person as is performing the functions of a financial or chief accounting officer), including in respect
of Synergies, run-rate effects and other pro forma adjustments; (ii) all calculations in respect of
Synergies (in each case actual or anticipated) may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such
Synergies were realized on the first day of the relevant period; (iii) all calculations in respect of an
actual or potential Specified Transaction (including to give pro forma effect to any such Specified
Transaction) may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such Specified Transaction was realized
on the first day of the relevant period; (iv) in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding on
any date of determination, pro forma effect may be given to any Incurrence, repayment, repurchase,
defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as if such transaction had
occurred on the first day of the relevant period; (v) in determining the equivalent in one currency of
any amount denominated in another currency for the purpose of compliance with Relevant Metric, the
Parent may calculate such amount using the currency equivalent of such amount; (vi) without prejudice
to any other provision for the benefit of any member of the Group, any Relevant Metric to be
determined in connection with a Relevant Transaction may, at the option of the Parent, be determined
as at the Relevant Test Date; (vii) if compliance with a Relevant Metric is established in accordance
with paragraph (vi) above, such Relevant Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or
satisfied) for all purposes, provided that: (A) the Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate
any Relevant Metric on the basis of a more recent Relevant Determination Date, in which case, such
date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Relevant Determination Date for
the purposes of such Relevant Metric; and (B) save as contemplated in sub-paragraph (A) above,
compliance with any Relevant Metric shall not be required to be determined or tested at any time after
the relevant Relevant Determination Date for such transaction and/or any actions or transactions
related thereto; (viii) in calculating the availability under any Relevant Metric in connection with any
action or transaction unrelated to the Relevant Transaction following the relevant Relevant
Determination Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Relevant Transaction is
consummated or the Parent determines (in its sole discretion) that such Relevant Transaction will not
be consummated, any such Relevant Metric may be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to
such Relevant Transaction; (ix) if, in connection with the same Relevant Transaction or otherwise
substantially simultaneously: (A) (1) any Relevant Metrics required to be determined by reference to
a fixed currency amount or a percentage of LTM EBITDA (a “fixed permission”) are intended to be
utilized and/or (2) revolving Indebtedness is intended to be Incurred; and (B) any Relevant Metrics
required to be determined by reference to the Relevant Total Leverage Ratio, the Relevant Leverage
Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Relevant Metric (a “ratio-based
**permission”) are intended to be utilized (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination of**
any increase or decrease in any such Relevant Metric), then (a) amounts available to be incurred under
the applicable ratio-based permissions shall first be calculated without giving effect to amounts to be
incurred under the applicable fixed permissions or the applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness,
or amounts previously incurred under such fixed permissions and not reclassified that are being repaid
in connection with such Relevant Transaction, in each case unless otherwise elected by the Parent and
(b) thereafter, compliance with any relevant fixed permissions shall be calculated, and in each case,
full pro forma effect shall be given to all increases to LTM EBITDA and repayments or discharges of
Indebtedness in connection with such Relevant Transaction in accordance with the Indenture and
(x) subject to clause (2) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof)_
is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission (whether a fixed currency amount, a
percentage of LTM EBITDA or otherwise) and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under
a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Parent, such action, matter, transaction or
amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

(c) If the Parent relies upon the provisions of clause (ix) of the second paragraph of the provisions
described under Construction, entitling the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary to Incur Indebtedness or
a Lien or make a Restricted Payment in connection with a committed acquisition or Restricted
Payment, if it were entitled to do so on the date of the commitment, then for the purposes of calculating
the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Total Leverage Ratio and


-----

the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, such transaction and the accompanying Incurrence of Indebtedness,
a Lien or a Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have already occurred on such commitment date
(and may therefore also as appropriate be given pro forma effect as though having occurred on the first
day of the relevant period).

(d) In the event that Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income is to be calculated prior to the
end of the fourth complete Financial Quarter after the Completion Date, Consolidated EBITDA or, as
the case may be, Consolidated Net Income for any part of the applicable Relevant Period falling prior
to the date on which the Target Group became part of the Group shall be calculated on the basis that
the definition of Consolidated EBITDA or, as the case may be, Consolidated Net Income is to be
construed as if references to the Group were references to the Target Group (where applicable, with
the Consolidated EBITDA or, as the case may be, Consolidated Net Income of the Group and the
Target Group to be aggregated).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the definitions set out under “—
_Certain Definitions” or “—Financial Calculations,” when calculating any financial definition or ratio_
under the Indenture the Parent shall be permitted to exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other
negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from: (i) any
branding or rebranding of the Group (or any part thereof) and/or start-up costs for new businesses; (ii)
any Tax referable to any payments, dividends or other distributions made or declared intra-Group; (iii)
the Transaction; (iv) any other acquisition, Investment or other Joint Venture permitted by the terms
of the Indenture; (v) costs or expenses relating to employee relocation, retraining, severance and
termination, business interruption, reorganization and other restructuring or cost cutting measures, the
rationalization, re branding, start up, reduction or elimination of product lines, assets or businesses,
the consolidation, relocation or closure of retail, administrative or production locations and other
similar items (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any related capital expenditure) and/or (vi)
research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof).In addition, the Parent may
exclude the impact of any purchase accounting when calculating any financial definition or ratio under
the Indenture. In calculating any financial ratio no item shall be included or excluded more than once
where to do so would result in double counting of that item.

hedging effect of any currency hedging entered into in respect of or by reference to that Indebtedness.

“Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio” means the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, but calculated by
replacing the term “Consolidated Leverage” in clause (x) of such definition with the term “Consolidated Net

nothing in the Indenture shall prohibit any step, action or matter arising in connection with any actual, proposed
or future payment of Tax (including as a consequence of the formation of a fiscal unity, any ‘group

treated as off balance sheet or derecognized under IFRS (as determined by the Parent in good faith), that

whether any action, transaction and/or incurrence of a liability (in each case including any replacement, renewal

entitled to rely on the fact that such action, transaction and/or incurrence was permitted at the time that action,
transaction and/or incurrence was originally taken, committed to or incurred (as the case may be) provided that,
in relation to the satisfaction of the Build Up Conditions set out in the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” if the Parent elects to rely on the provisions of this clause (ix) and make a_
determination based on the date a transaction was originally committed to, the relevant Restricted Payment shall

reasonably); (xii) for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any reference to calculating a financial ratio on a
pro forma basis, the Parent (or, as the case may be, the relevant member of the Group) shall be permitted to
make that calculation (including any adjustment) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture (including,
without limitation, by making any adjustment described in “—Financial Calculations”); (xiii) in the event that


-----

any person ceases to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Joint Venture, any amounts which would prior to such
cessation have fallen within (and consequently reduced the amount available to the Group under) any basket or
other limit set out in the Indenture as a result of such person being a an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Joint
Venture shall be ignored for the purpose of calculating the amount available under the relevant basket or limit;
and (xiv) where a member of the Group is permitted to make an election (or similar), that member of the Group
may revoke and re-make that election (or similar) at any time and from time to time.

If in any year the aggregate amount of any annual basket set out in the Indenture (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, excluding any “at any time” baskets) (each a “Permitted Basket”) which is utilized by the Group is
less than the basket originally available for that financial year (the difference being referred to as the “Available
**Amount”), then the maximum amount of that Permitted Basket for the immediately following year (for the**
purposes of this paragraph only, the “Carry Forward Year”) shall be increased by an amount equal to the
relevant Available Amount. In any Carry Forward Year, the original amount of a Permitted Basket shall be
treated as having been applied after any Available Amount carried forward into such Carried Forward Year.
Any Permitted Basket for the next financial year may be carried back to the current financial year with a
corresponding reduction in that Permitted Basket for the next following financial year. If any basket, limit,
threshold and/or other exception set out in the Indenture is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed
amount (the “numerical permission”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the
grower permission of such basket exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time (including, without
limitation, as a result of any adjustment described in “Financial Calculations”), the numerical permission shall
be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time (as
determined by the Parent in good faith) and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the
grower permission.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or
exceptions set out in the Indenture, the Parent, in its sole discretion, may classify (and may from time to time
reclassify) that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only be required to include
that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount or
transaction may at the option of the Parent be split between different baskets or exceptions), subject however
to clause (1) of the third paragraph of the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” in relation to Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date under the Facility. In addition_
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, when establishing whether any Relevant
Transaction is, was and/or remains permitted under the terms of the Indenture, the Group shall be entitled to
rely on the fact that such Relevant Transaction was permitted at the Relevant Determination Date and, if elected
by the Parent, references in the Indenture to the date of Incurrence, establishment, acquisition, Investment,
disposal, payment, designation, issuance, distribution, declaration, financing or refinancing, the date of
commitments being obtained or utilized, the date of any liability and/or obligation being outstanding and/or the
date of any transaction, step or matter or, in each case, any similar or equivalent construct shall be construed as
referring to the Relevant Determination Date in respect of the Relevant Transaction and if any related
requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for
which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Relevant Test Date would at any time after
the Relevant Determination Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or
continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have
been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have
occurred or be continuing).

**Certain Definitions**

“Accordion Amount” means Indebtedness and other obligations Incurred under the Senior Facilities
Agreement or any other Credit Facility; _provided that (i) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness_
Incurred thereunder shall not (unless the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under any other provision
of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) exceed the aggregate of:

(1) the maximum amount such that the Relevant Leverage Ratio is not greater than 4.75 to 1.00; plus

(2) the greater of (a) €700,000,000 and (b) 100% of LTM EBITDA,


-----

in each case tested at the time of (and taking into account) the relevant Incurrence of Indebtedness or,
at the Parent’s option, if earlier, at the time the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into any commitment to
Incur or issue Indebtedness (in such case assuming for this purpose only that such Indebtedness is utilized in
full) and, if such Indebtedness is to be used to fund, directly or indirectly, any transaction, on a pro forma basis
for such transaction; and provided further that (ii) if any amount may only be Incurred pursuant to this definition
on a basis which is junior to the Senior Secured Notes, such amount may only be taken into account under this
definition if the relevant Indebtedness to be Incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility will also be incurred on a
basis which is junior to the Senior Secured Notes; and provided further that the numerical limitation in clause
(i) will not apply to the Incurrence of Indebtedness if used to fund a transaction and such transaction does not
result in an increase in the Relevant Leverage Ratio (pro forma for that transaction).

“Acquired Indebtedness” means Indebtedness (1) of a Person or any of its Subsidiaries existing at
the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, (2) assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets

combines with the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that in the case of clauses (1) and (2) of this
definition whether or not Incurred by such Person in connection with such Person becoming a Restricted

which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or simultaneously with the event for
which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
**Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such**
Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or
such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, provided that the pro forma calculation of Fixed Charges shall

-----

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investment, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, consolidations, disposed or discontinued operations, Specified Transactions, savings programs, and
Group Initiatives that have been made or implemented (or, at the election of the Parent, planned or committed
or in respect of which any other action or step has been taken) by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date, may be calculated on
a pro forma basis in a manner consistent with the adjustments described in “Financial Calculations,” including
without limitation as to savings programs and other Group Initiatives, assuming that all such Investments,
acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, consolidations, Specified Transactions, Group Initiatives and disposed or
discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in
Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom), including the full run rate effect of anticipated Synergies, had
occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person
that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made or implemented any Investment, acquisition,
disposition, merger, consolidation, Specified Transaction, Group Initiative or disposed or discontinued any
operation that would have permitted or required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio may be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto, including anticipated Synergies, for such
period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation, Specified Transaction, Group
Initiative or disposed or discontinued operation and the full run rate effect of such anticipated Synergies had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (in each case in a manner consistent with the
adjustments described in “—Financial Calculations”).

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Group (or
such other person as is performing the functions of such a role), including Synergies. If any Indebtedness bears
a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable
rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit or
similar facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during the applicable period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on
Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate,
a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually
chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Parent may designate. For the purpose of
calculating pro forma effect under this definition, pro forma effect may also be given to anticipated acquisitions
where the Indebtedness to be Incurred is to finance such acquisitions in whole or in part, which have not yet
occurred but which have become subject to a definitive purchase agreement or other contract.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this definition shall prejudice or limit the right of the Parent or
any other member of the Group to make any adjustment or calculation (whether in relation to Consolidated
EBITDA, Fixed Charges, the Fixed Charge Cover Ratio or otherwise) in accordance with any other term of the
Indenture (including without limitation any adjustment described in “—Financial Calculations”).

All Applicable Metrics described in this definition will be calculated as set forth in the section “—
_Financial Calculations” above._

with this definition to the Trustee.

of placing such asset in service or taking final delivery and title thereto (or if the relevant supplier
customarily allows a period for payment, if later the date 180 days after the expiry of that period), in
each case save where the payment deferral results from the delayed or non-satisfaction of contract

caption “Use of Proceeds.” Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other
conditions as described below, the Senior Notes Issuer will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the
Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, the gross proceeds of
the issuance of the Senior Notes into a euro-denominated escrow bank account (the “SN Escrow Account”).
In the event that, in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer, (i) the Acquisition will not be
consummated on or prior to July 10, 2022 (the “Longstop Date”), (ii) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at
any time on or prior to the Longstop Date or (iii) certain other events occur, the Senior Notes Issuer will redeem
the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the initial
issue price of such Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the
Issue Date to (but not including) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.”_

Assuming the Completion Date (as defined below) occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date and the
funds are released from the SN Escrow Account, the Additional Guarantors will each become a party to the
Indenture upon accession thereto and will, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, guarantee the Senior Notes on a senior basis as soon as reasonably practicable after the Completion
Date but in any case no later than 150 days from the Completion Date. Prior to the Completion Date, the Parent
will not control the Target Group, and the Target Group will not be subject to the covenants described in this
“Description of the Senior Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the Target
Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those
covenants been applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the applicable perfection requirements, on the Issue Date
the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis by security granted
over the Senior Notes Issuer’s beneficial interest in the SN Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property. On the


-----

Completion Date, the security over the SN Escrow Account will be released, and the Senior Notes and the
Senior Notes Guarantees will be secured by the Initial Collateral (as defined below), together with certain other
Indebtedness of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries. See “—Security.”

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents
(as defined below) and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement. The following summary does not purport to be
complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all provisions of the Indenture, the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not
contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture, the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this
description under “—Certain Definitions.”

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (defined below) and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security,
the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action,
the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

**Brief Description of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees**

**_The Senior Notes_**

The Senior Notes will:

- be senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s existing and future debt that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes, including obligations in respect of the
Senior Facilities Agreement;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s future debt that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Senior Notes
Issuer and its subsidiaries (including obligations to trade creditors) that is secured by property or assets
that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such
obligation or indebtedness;

- be structurally subordinated to any future indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Parent (including
obligations to trade creditors), other than the Senior Notes Issuer, that do not guarantee the Senior
Notes;

- be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Guarantors, subject to the limitations under
applicable law as set forth under the caption “—The Senior Notes Guarantees”; and

- be represented by one or more registered Senior Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below). See “Book-Entry, Delivery and
_Form.”_

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Senior Notes will receive proceeds
from the enforcement of the Collateral (i) after obligations that are secured on a first-ranking basis, including
but not limited to obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes, and (ii) on
a pari passu basis with all indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes and that


-----

is secured on an equal-ranking basis in the Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The Senior Notes Guarantees_**

Once granted (as described under “—The Senior Notes Guarantees” below), each Senior Notes
Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

- be a senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank junior in right of payment with all of that Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is not
subordinated, including obligations in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior
Secured Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of that Guarantor’s future indebtedness that is subordinated in
right of payment to its Senior Notes Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor (including
obligations to trade creditors) that is secured by property or assets that do not constitute Collateral, to
the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligations or indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any future indebtedness or other obligations of that Guarantor’s
subsidiaries (including obligations to trade creditors) that do not guarantee the Senior Notes.

See “—The Senior Notes Guarantees.”

Payment under the Senior Notes Guarantees will be expressly subordinated in right of payment to the
payment when due of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors (including Indebtedness Incurred under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and any Hedging Agreements). As a result of this
subordination, holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full payment on all
obligations owed to them before any payment can be made to holders of the Senior Notes in respect of the
Senior Notes Guarantees.

**Principal and Maturity**

The Senior Notes Issuer will issue €550 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes on the
Issue Date. The Senior Notes will mature on    , 2029. The Senior Notes will be issued in global form in
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Notes is not a Business Day or a business day
at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next succeeding Business Day (or business day at such place, as the case may be), and will
not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Notes to receive the payments on such Senior
Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Interest on the Senior Notes**

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at the rate of   % per annum and will be payable, in cash,
semi-annually in arrears on   and  of each year, commencing on   , 2022. Interest on the Senior Notes will
be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related
interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or,
if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360day year comprised of twelve 30-day months on the aggregate principal amount outstanding. Each interest
period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.


-----

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Senior Notes Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under
the headings “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens,” the Senior Notes Issuer will be permitted to issue additional Senior Notes, without notice to or the_
consent of Holders of Senior Notes, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Senior Notes except
in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (as defined below)
supplied to the Trustee (“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes may be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes may bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or
rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such
interest may be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the
determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such
interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes may be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the maturity date or dates of such Additional Notes, and the date or dates and price or prices at which,
the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes
may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes may be issued and redeemed;

(8) the status of registration with the SEC of such Additional Notes or the applicable exemption from such
registration pursuant to which such Additional Notes may be offered or sold; and

(9) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Senior Notes, as a single class for the
purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series. Unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified, for all
purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Notes,” references to “Senior Notes” shall be
deemed to include references to the Senior Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional
Notes. For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, Additional Notes shall be deemed to form
one series with any Senior Notes previously issued if they have terms substantially identical in all material
respects to such other Senior Notes. In the event that any Additional Notes sold pursuant to Rule 144A are not
fungible with any Senior Notes previously issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such non-fungible
Additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification
number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued Senior Notes. Additional
Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer be issued
with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Senior Notes belonging
to the same series previously issued without being fungible with such series of initial Senior Notes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain
**_United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”) considering the purchase of Senior Notes sold_**
**pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of Senior Notes or in the secondary market, you should**
**consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the**


-----

**purchase, ownership and disposition of such Senior Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance**
**of Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Senior Notes for U.S. federal**
**income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified.**

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the Global
Notes (as defined below) will be payable through one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to Euroclear or Clearstream, which will credit the account specified by the Holder (being
Euroclear and Clearstream or their nominee).

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents
(as defined below) maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on any Definitive Registered Notes may
be paid at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer by bank transfer to the Holder thereof as shown on the register
for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Notes”
below.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Notes**

The Senior Notes Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the
Senior Notes for so long as the Senior Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent will be The
Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

The Senior Notes Issuer will also maintain (i) one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and (ii) a
transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV,
Dublin Branch and the initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch.
The Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on
and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer. The Transfer Agent
shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Senior Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar
or Transfer Agent for the Senior Notes without prior notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. If at the time of
such change, the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the
“Exchange”), and if and to the extent that the rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
“Authority”) so require, the Parent will notify the Authority that the such change has occurred and any relevant
details relating to such special mandatory redemption. The Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying
Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Notes will initially be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form
without interest coupons, as follows:

- Each series of the Senior Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

- The 144A Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

- Each series of the Senior Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global
Notes, the “Global Notes”).


-----

- The Regulation S Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Registrar or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or
Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules
and procedures governing their operations.

Any Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes that is transferred as described in the immediately
preceding paragraph will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the 144A Global Note from which
it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Regulation S Global Note to which it was
transferred.

In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common
Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Senior Notes belonging to the same series previously
issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Senior Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series (including in respect of
investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of
such Additional Notes) will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if
any) representing Senior Notes of that same series. Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of
sales of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Additional Senior_
_Secured Notes or Senior Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Senior Secured_
_Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, for United States federal income tax purposes,” “Book-Entry, Delivery_
_and Form—Transfers” and “—Additional Notes.”_

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive
Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as
otherwise determined by the Senior Notes Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and
will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in
aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such
transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among others, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee
at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes,
duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange
will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in
connection with such transfer.


-----

The Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will be
entitled to treat the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for
the purposes of the Indenture. In the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Parent will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Senior_
Secured Notes Issuer) as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive or affirmative covenants in the Indenture.

**Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes
Issuer will enter into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “SN
**Escrow Agreement”) among the Company, the Trustee and Lucid Agency Services Limited, as escrow agent**
(in such capacity, together with its successors, the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which the Senior Notes Issuer
will deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Senior
Notes sold on the Issue Date into the SN Escrow Account. The SN Escrow Account will be segregated from
the Senior Notes Issuer’s other funds. The SN Escrow Account will be in the name of, and controlled by, the
SN Escrow Agent subject to the terms of the SN Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer. The
initial funds deposited in the SN Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends,
distributions and other property and payments credited to the SN Escrow Account in connection with the Senior
Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the SN Escrow Agreement, such as ordinary
course charges and fees paid to the bank holding the SN Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the
“SN Escrowed Property.”

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Senior
Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders of the Senior
Notes, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Senior Notes Issuer’s
beneficial interest in the SN Escrow Account and the SN Escrowed Property, pursuant to an escrow account
charge dated the Issue Date between the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (the “SN
**Escrow Charge”); provided, however that such liens and security interest shall automatically be released and**
terminate upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate or a notice of Special
Mandatory Redemption. The SN Escrow Agreement will provide that the funds will be segregated and held for
the purposes specified herein. By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and
direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the SN Escrow Agreement and the SN
Escrow Charge. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—The Acquisition is subject to certain
_conditions and risks and, if it is not consummated, on or prior to the Longstop Date, the Issuers will be required_
_to redeem the Notes at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if_
_any.”_

The SN Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from the SN Escrow
Account, upon instruction of the Senior Notes Issuer, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to
the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date
or the most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the
Release (as defined below) in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Senior Notes
under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will
be entitled pursuant to the SN Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the SN Escrowed Property in respect
of negative interest having accrued on the SN Escrowed Property.

Before the SN Escrowed Property may be removed from the SN Escrow Account (the “Release”), the
Senior Notes Issuer must determine, on or before the Longstop Date, that: (1)(i) the Acquisition will be
consummated promptly following the release of the SN Escrowed Property and (ii) no material term or
condition of the Acquisition Agreement has been amended or waived in a manner or to an extent that would be
materially prejudicial to the interests of Holders, other than any amendment or waiver made with the consent
of Holders of a majority of the outstanding Senior Notes (provided that if the Majority Lenders, as defined in,


-----

and pursuant to the Senior Facilities Agreement shall have consented to any such amendment or waiver (or the
senior facilities are drawn without any such consent being required) then the consent of the Holders of a majority
of the outstanding Senior Notes shall be deemed to have been granted to such amendment or waiver) and (2) as
of the Release Date (defined below), there are no events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection with
respect to the Senior Notes Issuer. The Release will occur as soon as reasonably practicable following the
determination described above (the date of such determination, the “Release Date”). Upon the Release, the SN
Escrowed Property will be paid out of the SN Escrow Account in accordance with the SN Escrow Agreement
for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the SN Escrow Account will be reduced to zero.

In the event that (i) Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Longstop Date, (ii) in the
good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the
Longstop Date, (iii) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Longstop Date or (iv)
there is there an event of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection (as set out in clause (6) under “—Events of
_Default”) with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer on or prior to the Longstop Date (the date of any such event_
being the “Special Termination Date”), the Senior Notes Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special
**Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Senior Notes, plus accrued but**
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to (but not including) the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date).Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be
delivered by the Senior Notes Issuer, no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date,
to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, and will provide that the Senior Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is
no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given by the Senior Notes Issuer (the “Special
**Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Senior Notes Issuer shall**
pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s
Senior Notes and shall be entitled to use the SN Escrowed Property to make such payments. Notice of such
Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Senior Notes at least five Business Days
before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

The SN Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to
Holders of the Senior Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that
the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the
amount of the SN Escrowed Property, the shareholder of the Parent will be required to fund the difference
between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the SN Escrowed Property,
pursuant to a commitment provided by such shareholder (the “SN Escrow Equity Commitment”). The holders
of the Senior Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the SN Escrow Equity Commitment, and must rely
on the Senior Issuer’s rights to enforcement under the SN Escrow Equity Commitment.

The Senior Notes Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or
more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, and may transfer any portion of the
SN Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer
being deemed an Escrow Release; provided that the Company provides a substantially equivalent security
interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if
such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and provided further
that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original
Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which SN Escrowed Property
is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Company of an
Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the
transfer of the SN Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List
of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will
notify the Authority that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to
such special mandatory redemption.


-----

**The Senior Notes Guarantees**

The Senior Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis: (i) on the Issue Date, by the
Secured Notes Issuer (the “Initial Senior Notes Guarantee”), and (ii) subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Completion Date and in any event within the date that is 150 days
from the Completion Date, by the Target and its material subsidiaries (the “Target Guarantors” and, together
with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors,” and, such guarantees provided, the “Target Senior Notes
**Guarantees” and, together with the Initial Senior Notes Guarantee, the “Senior Notes Guarantees”). The**
Guarantors will grant the Senior Notes Guarantees and will also, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
guarantee the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Secured Notes on a senior secured basis.

Each of the Senior Notes Guarantees is a senior subordinated Guarantee, which means that, pursuant
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, each such Senior Notes Guarantee ranks behind,
and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor,
including any obligations owed by the relevant Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities
Agreement and any secured hedging. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors under their
Senior Notes Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the
terms of the Senior Notes Guarantees, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into
after the Issue Date. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, see
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Because of the subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other
creditors (including trade creditors) of a Guarantor would recover disproportionately more than the holders of
the Senior Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such Guarantor. In any such case,
there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Senior Notes.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the expected Target Guarantors will be the Target and TMobile Netherlands B.V.). For the year ended December 31, 2020, on an unconsolidated basis and without
giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other adjustments in relation to consolidation, the Target
Guarantors (expected to be the Target and T-Mobile Netherlands) represented (i) 92.1% of the Target Group’s
net revenue and (ii) 94.3% of the Target Group’s EBITDA. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, on
an unconsolidated basis and without giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other adjustments in
relation to consolidation, the Target Guarantors represented (i) 90.3% of the Target Group’s net revenue, and
(ii) 103.0% of the Target’s Group EBITDA, which is higher than the consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group
for nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to negative EBITDA of some of non-Target
Guarantor entities for this period. As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, after giving effect to
intercompany eliminations attributable to share capital but not to other adjustments in relation to consolidation,
the Target Guarantors represented 117.0% and 130.0%, respectively, of the Target Group’s total assets, which
are higher than the consolidated total assets of the Target Group for the relevant periods due to the negative
value of total assets at some of the non-Target Guarantor entities as a result of intercompany position relating
to operations of these entities with the Target Guarantors, whereby, prior to consolidation, their liabilities
exceed their assets.

In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Senior
_Notes Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior Notes Guarantee in the future._
The term “Senior Notes Guarantees” or “Guarantors” shall also be deemed to refer to any such future additional
Guarantee or Guarantees that may be granted from time to time in accordance with the Indenture.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions
on the granting of guarantees where, among others, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other
legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, justified corporate interest (where
applicable), fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters. See
“—Security—Summary of Agreed Security Principles.”

Each Senior Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United


-----

States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the
Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of
this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its
Senior Notes Guarantee. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees
_and Security—Insolvency Law Considerations—The Netherlands—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability_
_of the Security Interests.”_

The Senior Notes Issuer is a holding company, and, therefore, the Senior Notes Issuer will be
dependent on cash flows from intercompany loans or other payments or distributions from its subsidiaries to
meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Indebtedness and Financial Information—The Issuers are holding companies that do not have any revenue_
_generating operations of their own and depend on cash from operating companies to be able to make payments_
_on the Notes.”_

Not all of the subsidiaries of the Target will guarantee the Senior Notes. Claims of creditors of nonguarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees
issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of
creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including the Holders. The Senior Notes and each
Senior Notes Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and
preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Parent. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The Notes will be structurally_
_subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.”_

The Senior Notes Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate and be released:

(1) upon the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger or
amalgamation) of ownership interests in the relevant Guarantor (directly or through a Holding
Company of such Guarantor) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the
sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Senior Notes
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition
does not violate the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) as described in the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Senior Notes Guarantees”;_

(5) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below);

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant
consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation” and the Indenture;_

(8) with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor pursuant to
which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Senior Notes Issuer or a
Guarantor;

(9) in the case of any Guarantor that is a Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, pursuant to the
provisions described below under “—IPO Pushdown”; or


-----

(10) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes.

At the request and expense of the Senior Notes Issuer and, if applicable, at the request of the Security
Agent, the Trustee shall take all reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release or
amendment of a Senior Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions. Each of the releases and
amendments set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without any consent of the Holders or any other
action or consent on the part of the Trustee. The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and
rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such release complies with the Indenture, without further
inquiry, investigation, independent verification or liability of any kind.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, the applicable perfection
requirements and Permitted Collateral Liens, the Senior Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by an
English law charge over the Senior Notes Issuer’s beneficial interest in the SN Escrow Account.

On or around the Completion Date, the bank account charge over the Senior Note Issuer’s beneficial
interest in the SN Escrow Account will be released and replaced by:

- a Dutch law share pledge over the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and

- a Dutch law pledge over any material structural loan receivables owed to the Parent by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer

(such items collectively, together with any additional assets that may from time to time be subject to
security in favor of the Senior Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior
Secured Notes, and potentially other future Indebtedness, on a first-ranking basis, ahead of any claims of the
Senior Notes.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of
the Holders of the Senior Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral.
Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Notes, any
Senior Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral shall be subject to
the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, the applicable perfection requirements and any Permitted
Collateral Liens.

**_Summary of Agreed Security Principles_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets will not be pledged (or the Liens not perfected), or
guarantees given, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including:

- if providing such guarantee or security would be prohibited by general statutory or regulatory
limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, liquidity maintenance,
fraudulent preference, “controlled foreign corporation,” “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions,
retention of title claims and similar matters or providing security would be outside the applicable
pledgor’s legal capacity or conflict with fiduciary duties of directors, officers or other legal
representatives or contravene any legal prohibition, contractual restriction or regulatory condition or
cause material risk of personal or criminal liability, in each case, after the use of reasonable endeavors
to overcome such obstacle;

- if the cost of providing the guarantee or security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the
holders of the Senior Notes;


-----

- if there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets of a Guarantor in a
particular category of assets, only the material assets in that category will be subject to security;

- if it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over
certain categories of assets, security will not be taken over such assets;

- if providing such security requires consent before such assets may be secured or where providing such
security would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or
obligations of the Parent, the Senior Notes Issuer or any of their Subsidiaries in respect of those assets
or require any of them to take any action materially adverse to their interests and where (subject to
certain conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;

- if providing or perfecting such guarantee or security would have a material adverse effect (as
reasonably determined in good faith by such Subsidiary) on the ability of such Subsidiary to conduct
its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the indenture and any
requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any
other action shall be subject to this principle;

- if the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes relating to the provision of the
guarantee or security are material;

- if the assets are, or the relevant member of the Group is, located outside the security jurisdiction, being
the Netherlands and any other jurisdiction later designated as such pursuant to the Senior Facilities
Agreement;

- in the case of any guarantee or security from or over, or over assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any entity (other than the Parent) that is not wholly-owned; and

- in the case of assets subject to security in favor of a third party.

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any Operating
Facilities (as defined and designated pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement), and certain hedging agreements.
Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the Parent is permitted to_
grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, including on a basis prior to the Senior Notes. Any proceeds received upon any
enforcement over any Collateral will be applied first to discharge obligations that are secured over the Collateral
on a priority basis, including but not limited to the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes,
and thereafter pro rata in payment of all liabilities in respect of obligations under the indenture and the Senior
Notes and any other Indebtedness of the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and
secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement that is not subordinated in
right of payment to the Senior Notes. In the future, pursuant to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles,
the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and/or counterparties to certain hedging agreements and any
Senior Secured Notes may also benefit from security which does not secure the Senior Notes offered hereby.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under
or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and Security” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Each Guarantee is_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_


-----

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. In addition, in
certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the
secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law or before courts in certain of these
jurisdictions. The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the
Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the rights of the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf or on behalf of
the Holders) to take enforcement action under the Security Documents with respect to the Collateral are subject
to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. For a description
of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

The ability of holders of the Senior Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various
bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Senior Notes Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. In addition,
the enforcement of the Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security
Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations,
the enforceable amounts of a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee could be significantly
less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee. See “—The Senior Notes Guarantees,” “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and Security” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Dutch_
_insolvency laws may provide you with less protection than bankruptcy laws of other jurisdictions you are_
_familiar with.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and any other
Collateral provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral
securing the Senior Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral
and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer
in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale
of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Senior Notes, after the
payment in full of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes, certain Hedging
Obligations and any other Indebtedness of the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and
secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. By its nature, some or all
of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The Notes are_
_secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted or will be granted as security for_
_the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes_
_and the Guarantees.”_

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability
of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements
that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed
by a valuation. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Trustee for the Senior Notes has, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to
which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other


-----

incidental rights, power and discretions and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee
and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the Collateral as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and other future indebtedness, (b) the counterparties under certain hedging arrangements, (c) the
Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture, (d) the Trustee and the holders of the
Senior Notes under the Indenture and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by
the Collateral, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which
provide that the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, such hedging
arrangements and such permitted or other future Indebtedness will receive proceeds of enforcement of security
over the Collateral equally and ratably on a first priority basis, and certain other creditors, such as holders of
the Senior Notes, will receive proceeds of enforcement over that portion of the Collateral pursuant to which
they are also secured only after those obligations secured on a first priority basis are satisfied in full. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral
may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment
_of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent will take any action necessary and reasonably required by, and at the cost of, the
Senior Notes Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral required by a Security Document in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Senior Notes issued
under the Indenture or satisfaction and discharge or defeasance thereof in accordance with the
Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Senior Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person
other than the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant_
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is
otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, as described in the second paragraph of the covenant
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(6) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) with respect to assets held by or the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in connection with a
solvent liquidation of such Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of
such Restricted Subsidiary remain owned by the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor;


-----

(9) if on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture, including under the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary,
the Trustee, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes. The Security Agent and the Trustee shall
be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and, at its option, an Opinion of Counsel,
certifying which circumstances give rise to the release of Collateral and that such release complies with the
Indenture.

The Senior Notes Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries and any other Collateral provider may also, among
others, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities
with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation, (i) selling, pledging or otherwise disposing of, in
any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien under the Security Documents
which has become worn out, defective or obsolete or not used or useful in the business, (ii) selling, pledging,
transferring or otherwise disposing of current assets in the ordinary course of business and (iii) any other action
permitted by the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event of a conflict between the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the request of
the Senior Notes Issuer, enter into with the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries and the
holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives), one or more intercreditor agreements or
deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification of the Intercreditor Agreement)
(an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement
(or terms that are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Senior Notes as compared to the Intercreditor
Agreement) and substantially similar as applies to sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of
security, priority and release of security; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose
any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the personal rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement. As used herein, a reference to the Intercreditor Agreement will also include any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Senior Notes thereby; _provided, that such transaction would comply with the covenant_
described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Senior Notes Issuer and without the
consent of holders of the Senior Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into
one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the Parent or the Restricted Subsidiaries that are subject to
any such Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the
Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure
the Senior Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens
or to implement a pushdown in relation to an IPO Event in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or
(6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of Senior Notes in
any material respect.


-----

The Senior Notes Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—
_Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior Notes_
Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment
does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or
Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or
any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered
into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s
behalf.

**IPO Pushdown**

(1) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Senior Notes Issuer shall be entitled to require
(by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate
(with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis that: (i) references
to the Parent and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO
Pushdown Entity and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; (ii) all
financial ratio, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Holding Company of the
IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown
Entity; (iii) each reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Parent” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity
(to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise, and provided further that nothing
in this clause (1), including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-clause (iii) and any action
taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Parent, shall, or shall be deemed
to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the indenture
or a Default or an Event of Default); (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings,
covenants or Events of Default in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO
Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no event,
matter or circumstance relating to any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its
capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default;
(vi) each Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by any such Holding Company; (vii) unless
otherwise notified by the Senior Notes Issuer: (A) each person which is party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor” shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) (and from the date specified by the Senior Notes Issuer that person shall
cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an
Investor and shall have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor) and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement
for any person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor and (viii) in the event that any person is released from or does not become
party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor as a
consequence of this clause (1), any term of the indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any person be an Investor or that
any liabilities or obligations to such person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply. A Pushdown


-----

Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
(disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this provision).

(2) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture or
amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or the Security Documents required by the Senior Notes Issuer and/or take such other
action as is required by the Senior Notes Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters
contemplated by clause (1) above; provided that such amendment, replacement or other document or
instrument does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the
opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent (as applicable), does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent (as applicable) under such amendment,
replacement or other document or instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are each irrevocably
authorized and instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute any such
amended or replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall
do so on the request of and at the cost of the Senior Notes Issuer).

(3) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Parent notified to the Trustee by the Senior Notes Issuer in writing as the person to be treated as
the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event, provided that the IPO Pushdown Entity
shall be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold,
pursuant to that IPO Event (or a Holding Company of such Restricted Subsidiary), and the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer shall be a Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer or the applicable successor to
the Senior Notes Issuer (in each case, either before or after giving effect to the anticipated IPO Event).

(4) If the Senior Notes Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee and Security Agent pursuant to
clause (1) above in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown
Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee
and Security Agent. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this clause
(4): (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (1)(i) to (1)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that
Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to clause (1) above in reliance on that
Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security
Document in respect of that security and (iii) if any person party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an
“Investor” has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-clause (1)(vii) above
in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement as an Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this clause (4) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Senior
Notes Issuer from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event
and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute
or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or a Default or an Event of Default
(whether by reason of any action or step taken by any person, or any matter or circumstance arising or
committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and
“—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Senior Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Senior Notes
Issuer.

At any time prior to   , 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Notes at its option,
upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of such Senior Notes, plus the relevant Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date.


-----

At any time prior to   , 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem at its option, upon not less than
ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, during each 12 month period commencing after the Issue Date, up to
10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes in every 12 month period, commencing on the Issue
Date (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes forming part of the same series as
the Senior Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after   , 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem the
Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at its option, upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a
redemption price equal to the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes so redeemed
set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes redeemed,
to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date if redeemed during the periods beginning on    of the years
indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2024 .............................................................................................................................................................. %
2025 .............................................................................................................................................................. %
2026 and thereafter ....................................................................................................................................... 100.00000%

At any time and from time to time prior to  , 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may, at its option, on any
one or more occasions redeem Senior Notes issued under the Indenture with the Net Cash Proceeds received by
the Parent from any Equity Offering, upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption
price equal to   % of the principal amount of the Senior Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for all
such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including
any Additional Notes forming part of the same series as the Senior Notes), as the case may be, provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original principal amount of the Senior Notes (including any Additional Notes
forming part of the same series as the Senior Notes) issued under the Indenture remains outstanding
after each such redemption.

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion of any such
Equity Offering.

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. Any
redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction
of one or more conditions precedent (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of
Indebtedness, a Change of Control or any other transaction). In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject
to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied,
or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions
shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no
case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such
redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the
redemption price and performance of the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may
be performed by another Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of Senior
Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Senior Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Senior Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Notes Issuer, or any third


-----

party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior Notes Issuer, purchases, all of the Senior Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Senior Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right
upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender
offer expiration date, to redeem the Senior Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part following
such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive
fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

The Senior Notes Issuer, its direct and indirect equity holders, including the Initial Investors and Parent
Holding Companies, Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer and any of their respective Affiliates and members
of our management may acquire at any time and from time to time our outstanding debt securities or loans,
including the Senior Notes, by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases,
negotiated transactions or otherwise, and such purchases may be at prices below par. The amounts involved in
any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be
with respect to a substantial amount of the Senior Notes or another series of debt, with the attendant reduction
in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

If the Senior Notes Issuer effects an optional redemption of any series of the Senior Notes, it will, if
and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, if and to the extent the rules
of the Authority so require, inform the Authority of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate
principal amount of the applicable series of Senior Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such
redemption.

**Sinking Fund**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments, except as set
out under “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” or sinking fund payments with respect to
the Senior Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar,
as applicable, will select the Senior Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal
securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Registrar, as applicable, by the Senior Notes Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream (as applicable), or if the Senior Notes are not so listed or such
exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Senior Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream
or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, on a _pro rata_ basis by use of a pool factor;
_provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part_
and only Senior Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent,
the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will be liable to any person for any selections made by it in accordance with
this paragraph.

Notices of redemption (other than in connection with a Special Mandatory Redemption) will be
delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least ten days but not more than 60 days before the
redemption date to each Holder of Senior Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except
that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date
if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture.

If any Senior Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior
Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the
original Senior Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Senior
Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Senior Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior Notes called for redemption


-----

become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Senior Notes Issuer
defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on Senior Notes or portions of
them called for redemption on the applicable redemption date

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Senior Notes Issuer may redeem at its discretion the Senior Notes of a series in whole, but not in
part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders (which notice will
be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Senior Notes Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”)
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”), if any,
then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if
any, if the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, rulings or protocols
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, rulings or protocols (including a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the
Senior Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Notes, and such
obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be
reasonable but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Senior Notes. In
the case of redemption due to withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that
is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must
become effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to
withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on
or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. Notice of redemption for taxation
reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “Selection and Notice.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be obliged to make such payment of Additional
Amounts if a payment in respect of the Senior Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is
given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of
any notice of redemption of the Senior Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to
the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Senior Notes Issuer, or its
successor, where applicable, is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing
that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of a tax counsel of
recognized standing and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld)
to the effect that the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable,
is or would become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and
the Paying Agent will be able to rely absolutely and without further inquiry on such Officer’s Certificate and
opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further
inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the Senior Notes or the
Senior Notes Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account
of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:


-----

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Note or Senior Notes Guarantee
is made by the Payor or its agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a
resident or engaged in business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental
Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”),**

will at any time be required from any payments made by or on behalf of a Payor with respect to any
Senior Note or Senior Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or
interest, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional
**Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each**
Holder after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional
Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in respect of such payments
on any such Senior Note or Senior Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Senior Note or Senior Notes
Guarantee (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of
power over, the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, incorporated in, or
carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the
acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Note or Senior Notes Guarantee or the receipt of any
payment in respect thereof, or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Note or Senior
Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Senior Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial
owner, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of
the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other
reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, such Taxes, provided in each case the Holder or
beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Senior Notes or any Senior Notes Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended
or successor version that is substantially comparable), any agreements entered into pursuant to
Section 1471(b) of the Code and any intergovernmental agreements (and related legislation or official
administrative guidance) implemented with respect to the foregoing;

(6) any Taxes imposed or withheld in connection with a Senior Note presented for payment (where
presentation is permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who
would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Senior Note to, or otherwise
accepting payment from, another paying agent;

(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to The Netherlands Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet
_bronbelasting 2021); or_


-----

(8) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without
such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Senior Note for payment
(where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first
made available for payment to the beneficiary or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Senior Note been
the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason
of any of clauses (1) to (8) inclusive above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a
fiduciary or a partnership or limited liability company or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Senior
Note to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or
limited liability company or the beneficial owner of such payment or Senior Note would not have been entitled
to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Note
directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary
course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and will provide such
certified copies to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the
Holders upon written request. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the
amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect
of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per €1,000
principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect
to any payment made on any Senior Note or Senior Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such
payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable
the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation
to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the
payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in either the Indenture, the Senior Notes Guarantees or this “Description of the Senior Notes”
there are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of Senior Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Notes or Senior Notes Guarantees,
such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in
respect thereof.

The Senior Notes Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any
other property or similar taxes, charges or levies, that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Senior Notes, any Senior Notes Guarantees, the
Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in
connection with a transfer or exchange of the Senior Notes), and the Senior Notes Issuer agrees to indemnify
the Holders for any such Taxes paid by such Holders.


-----

The foregoing obligations of this “Withholding Taxes” section will survive any termination,
defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to the Senior Notes Issuer or Guarantor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a
resident or engaged in business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof
or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party
makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer has previously or substantially
concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Senior Notes Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the
Senior Notes (equal to €100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof;
_provided that Senior Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may only be purchased in whole and not in_
part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a purchase price in cash equal
to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering
Event, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer
electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail,
with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the
transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase
the Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier
than ten days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures
required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control
Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described
in the Indenture by compliance therewith. The Senior Notes Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by
the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer
satisfies certain conditions.

Unless the Senior Notes Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Notes
as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Notes
Issuer will mail a notice of the Change of Control Offer to each Holder of any such Senior Notes, with a copy
to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has
the right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control Triggering Event;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Notes Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a
Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Notes repurchased; and


-----

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that
the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering
Event.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have
occurred, the Senior Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Senior Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Senior Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer in the Change
of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to
and purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Notes Issuer.

If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Parent will notify the Authority of any Change of Control
Offer .

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does
not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the
Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control
Triggering Event may require prepayment and cancellation or other consequences in respect of the Senior
Facilities Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may also
contain prohibitions on, or entail consequences arising from, certain events which would constitute a Change
of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid
upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of
their right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to
the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Notes Issuer.

The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Notes following the occurrence
of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore,
sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control
Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control
Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Senior Notes Issuer could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to
Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the_
Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not


-----

contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction.

The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change
of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times
and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes has been given
pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the
payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due
to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a
Change of Control Triggering Event.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the
Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change
of Control Triggering Event has occurred and the decision whether to make an offer to repurchase the Senior
Notes as described above will in such circumstance be made in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes
Issuer.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified
with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness), _provided that the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur_
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the Relevant Test Date and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 or the Relevant Total Leverage Ratio is not
greater than 7.00 to 1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created under or pursuant to any Credit Facility) or the Senior Secured Notes,
and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect of such
Indebtedness, in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding
(a) €3,900,000,000; plus (b) the Accordion Amount; plus (c) in the case of any refinancing or other
replacement of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate
amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection
with such refinancing or replacement (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Refinancing
Indebtedness shall not otherwise be subject to any limit set out in this clause (1));

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary, in each case so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted
under the terms of the Indenture; or

(a) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising
by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the


-----

Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case so long as the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Parent owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that_
(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary and
(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the
Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in clauses
(1) and (3) of this paragraph) of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date
(or Incurred after the Issue Date under local lines of credit, bilateral facilities, operating facilities,
working capital facilities and/or other arrangements which are in place on the Issue Date), including
the Senior Notes, and any Guarantee in respect of any of the foregoing, (b) Indebtedness Incurred
under or pursuant to any Second Lien Financing or any Senior Parent Financing, (c) Refinancing
Indebtedness (including with respect to the Senior Notes and any Guarantee thereof) Incurred in

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, this covenant:

(1) in the event that all or any portion of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Parent, in its sole
discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one
of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; _provided that all_
Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes on the
Issue Date shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant (and
not clause (4)(a)) and may not be reclassified pursuant to this clause;

(2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph
above or clause (1), (8), (10) or (11) of the second paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(6) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(7) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of that
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary or otherwise used to pay the
aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with any such
refinancing, replacement, exchange, renewal, extension or other action; and


-----

(8) with respect to any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a clause limited by reference to a fixed euro
amount in the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time that the Parent would be entitled to
have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall, unless otherwise elected by the Parent, be automatically
reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock
or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant (provided that the amount of
any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (if elected by the Parent) be
increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount
and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be deemed
to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred). The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any
date shall be calculated as specified under the definition of “Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent as of such date.

In the case of any revolving facility or similar or equivalent arrangement, when calculating compliance
with this covenant the Parent shall be entitled to calculate Consolidated EBITDA (and/or, where applicable,
any other definition, ratio or test) at the time the relevant commitments are obtained (without any further
requirement to calculate compliance at the time such commitments are utilized).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on its currency equivalent at the Relevant Test Date, provided that (a) if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness
does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, (b) the Euro Equivalent
of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the currency equivalent of such amount on the Issue Date and (c) if and for so long as any such
Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is
denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if
denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency
Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which
is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall
be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

case to the extent practicable in the context of the Investment); (ii) any assets acquired pursuant to that
Investment are contributed or transferred to the Group (whether by way of equity investment, merger
or otherwise) as soon as reasonably practicable following completion of such Investment and (iii) any


-----

assets received by the Group pursuant to paragraph (ii) above shall not constitute an “Excluded
Contribution” or be deemed to increase the amount calculated pursuant to sub-paragraphs (c)(ii) and
(iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the Relevant
Test Date for such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by
the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair
market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any noncash Restricted Payment shall be determined as described under the definition of “fair market value.” Any
amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the
amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of clause (c) of the first paragraph
of this covenant will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds
or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would
otherwise constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event, (2) the purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of
such Net Cash Proceeds or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio
of the Parent so that there would not be an occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event that would have
occurred without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of
Control Offer is made in connection with such event in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture.

Nothing in this covenant shall prohibit any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of, any Senior Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or
Senior Parent Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall prohibit the roll up or
capitalization of any amount due in respect of New Equity or Subordinated Shareholder Funding.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien, in each
case, on the SN Escrow Account, except for the benefit of the Holders or as set forth under clause (11) of the
definition of Permitted Liens.

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien, in each case, to secure any Indebtedness, upon any of its assets (including
Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that
date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such
Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (1) in the case of any asset that does not constitute Collateral, (a) Permitted
Liens or (b) Liens on assets that are not Permitted Liens if, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior
Notes and the Indenture (or a Senior Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens in respect of a Guarantor) are directly
secured equally and ratably with or junior to, in the case of Senior Indebtedness, or prior to, in the case of Liens
with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured and (2) in the case of any asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Guarantees and the Indenture pursuant
to clause (1)(b) of the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
(i) upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant
Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of
such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Senior Notes Issuer
or a Guarantor to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance
or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Parent;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Parent; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Parent,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility, the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in
effect at or entered into on the Issue Date or on any applicable date on which any Permitted Collateral
Lien securing the Senior Notes is granted;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person
was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of
assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant
to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Parent or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into
or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes
of this clause (2), if another Person is the successor company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Parent
or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the successor company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred
to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); _provided that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such_
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Parent);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;


-----

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under
the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the
property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;
or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on
the property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that
imposes restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its assets) imposed
pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or
substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the assets that are subject
to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to
the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement
and the Intercreditor Agreement, together with the Security Documents associated therewith as in
effect on the Issue Date, or those contained in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) in
comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Parent) or where either (x) the Parent
determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Parent’s ability to make principal or interest payments on
the Senior Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a
default relating to such agreement or instrument;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on
_Liens”; or_

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Receivables Facility
that, in the good faith determination of the Parent, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified
Receivables Financing or such Receivables Facility.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by
any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to


-----

the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to
such Asset Disposition) of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap); and

(2) an amount equal to the Required Percentage (as defined below) of the Net Available Cash from such
Asset Disposition is directly or indirectly applied by the Parent or any relevant Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required
by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase
any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary) (“Non-Guarantor Debt”),
any Senior Indebtedness, Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement, Indebtedness
constituting Senior Lender Liabilities, SSN Liabilities or Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities and/or Indebtedness Incurred under clauses (1), (15) and/or (16) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (or in each case
any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 548 days from the later of (A) the
date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that,
in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (a), where applicable, the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such
Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except in the case of any
revolving Indebtedness, including, but not limited to, the Revolving Facility, asset-based
facility, guarantee facility or other similar or equivalent arrangement) to be permanently
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased, (ii) to
prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the
principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest (together
with any applicable prepayment or redemption premiums) to the date of such prepayment,
repayment or purchase; or

(b) to the extent the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest
in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Parent or another Restricted
Subsidiary) or otherwise in the business of the Group, including any capital expenditure,
within 638 days from the later of (x) the date of such Asset Disposition and (y) the receipt of
such Net Available Cash; _provided that (i) any such reinvestment made pursuant to a_
definitive binding agreement or a commitment that is executed or approved within such time
and (ii) any such reinvestment designated by the Parent within such time, will satisfy this
requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within twelve calendar months of
such 638th day; and/or

(c) to the extent the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, in or towards any payment
(whether by way of dividend, distribution, loan, repayment or otherwise), transaction or other
arrangement (including, without limitation, any payments or other transactions or
arrangements of a type contemplated by the covenant described herein under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments;” within 638 days from the later of (A) the_
date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, provided that
the Relevant Total Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to that payment
does not exceed 5.50 to 1.00; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided, further, that (1) pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance_
with clause (a) through (d) above, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture and
(2) the Parent (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets or
otherwise in the business of the Group prior to receiving the Net Available Cash attributable to any given Asset


-----

Disposition and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above
with respect to such Asset Disposition.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested, committed or
designated to be applied or invested as provided for in clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be
deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 639th day after an Asset Disposition, or at
such earlier date that the Parent elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds
the greater of (x) €280,000,000 and (y) 40% of LTM EBITDA and has not been committed in accordance with
clauses (2)(b) or (2)(c) of the first paragraph of this covenant (or if so committed, has not been applied or
invested in accordance with such commitment within the relevant period), the Parent will be required to make
an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Senior Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the
extent the Parent elects, to holders of all or any other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the
maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset
Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price
in respect of the Senior Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, at an offer
price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes and 100% of the principal amount of
such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest (together with any applicable
prepayment or redemption premiums), if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari
Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the case of the Senior Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds,
the Parent may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.
If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders
and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered
Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of
any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such
aggregate principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Parent that is
within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer,
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be deemed to be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net
Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness are denominated, the
amount thereof payable in respect of tendered Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness shall not exceed the
net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness are denominated
that is actually received by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary upon converting such portion into such
currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Notes, will remain open for a period
of not less than five Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No
later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition
**Purchase Date”), the Parent will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Senior**
Notes and, to the extent they elect, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid, prepaid or purchased pursuant
to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount
has been so validly tendered, all Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the
Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Parent will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Senior Notes, in minimum denominations


-----

of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Parent will deliver to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Parent
in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly
(but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail
or deliver to each tendering Holder of Senior Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Notes
so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Parent for purchase, and
the Parent will promptly issue a new Senior Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee (or its
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Parent, will authenticate and mail or
deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal
amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior
Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Any Senior Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered
(or transferred by book entry) by the Parent to the Holder thereof.

For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no requirement to offer to apply any Excess Proceeds in
prepayment of the Revolving Facility.

For the purpose of this covenant, “Required Percentage” shall mean:

(1) if at the time of application the Relevant Leverage Ratio (adjusted to give effect to any relevant
purchase, prepayment and/or other application assuming that all relevant holders of Indebtedness
accept that prepayment and/or other application) is greater than 4.50 to 1.00, 100%;

(2) if at the time of application the Relevant Leverage Ratio (adjusted as if any relevant prepayment and/or
other application had taken place on the last day of the relevant measurement period and assuming that
all relevant holders of Indebtedness accept that prepayment and/or other application) is greater than
4.25 to 1.00 but less than or equal to 4.50 to 1.00, 50%; and

(3) if at the time of application the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (adjusted as if any relevant
prepayment and/or other application had taken place on the last day of the relevant measurement period
and assuming that all relevant holders of Indebtedness accept that prepayment and/or other application)
is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.00, 0%.

For the avoidance of doubt, any amount of Net Available Cash from any Asset Disposition which is
not required to be applied in accordance with clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant above as a result
of such amount being in excess of the Required Percentage or otherwise shall not constitute Excess Proceeds
and may be used for any other purpose not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

The Parent will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Notes
are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that
the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant,
the Parent will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into
any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Parent (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate value in excess of 10% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Parent
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and


-----

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(x) €70,000,000 and (y) 20% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by
a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Parent.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payment or any Permitted Investment;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements to purchase Capital Stock of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Holding
Company restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or
arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Parent, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances, any transaction pursuant to or in connection with an MIP, incentive
scheme or similar arrangement (including any MIP Payment) and any waiver or transaction with
respect thereto;

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries
and (b) any Permitted Reorganization;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or
any Parent Holding Company (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned
or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for
purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, including without
limitation the Transaction Documents, as these agreements and instruments may be amended,
modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the
other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect, the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in
connection with any Public Offering, and the performance of any agreement, the entry into which
satisfies the requirements of this covenant;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and
maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes
in the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each
case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary
in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the Senior Management of the Parent or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably
have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Parent or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an


-----

Affiliate Transaction solely because the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Parent or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; or (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction
with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the
Indenture;

(11) (a) payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly, including through any Parent Holding Company) of fees and/or expenses in an aggregate
amount not to exceed in each fiscal year the greater of €35,000,000 and 5% of LTM EBITDA; and
(b) customary payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether
directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Holding Company) for financial advisory,
consulting, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking
activities, including in connection with acquisitions, divestitures or exits;

(12) (a) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred or payable by
such Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including any Parent Holding Company Expenses; and (b) payment of reasonable fees
and costs for non-executive directors of the Parent who are nominees of Investors if the amount of
those fees and costs does not exceed the greater of €35,000,000 and 5% of LTM EBITDA in aggregate
in any Financial Year;

(13) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Receivables Facility;

(14) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in
connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or entered into with
any Business Successor, in each case, that the Parent determines in good faith is either fair to the Parent
or otherwise on customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar transactions;
and

(15) transactions in which the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Parent
or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause (1) of
the preceding paragraph.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Senior Notes are outstanding, the Parent will provide to the Trustee the following
reports:

(1) within 150 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Parent ending after the Issue Date, annual
reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Parent as of the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated
income statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent for the most two recent fiscal years,
including customary footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors
on the financial statements, provided that in respect of any period commencing prior to the Issue Date,
the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target may be provided in place of the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Parent; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information
and balance sheet information of the Parent (to the extent pro forma information has not previously
been provided by the Parent, and which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of
a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt the Acquisition itself); (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and


-----

capital resources of the Parent, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and
critical accounting policies, with a similar scope to that included in this Offering Memorandum; (d) a
description of the business, management and shareholders of the Parent, all material affiliate
transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt
instruments and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days after the end of each of the Parent’s first three fiscal quarters in each financial year (or
90 days in the case of the first such fiscal quarter after the Issue Date), all quarterly reports containing
the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Parent as of
the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow of the Parent for
the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and
the comparable prior year period of the Parent, together with condensed footnote disclosure, provided
that in respect of any period commencing prior to the Issue Date, the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of the Target may be provided in place of the unaudited consolidated financial statements
of the Parent; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of
the Parent (to the extent pro forma information has not previously been provided by the Parent, which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet
to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant
quarter (other than, for the avoidance of doubt the Acquisition itself); (c) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations,
financial condition, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Parent, and
a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course of business in commitments and
contingencies since the most recent report and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior
executive officer changes at the Parent or change in auditors of the Parent or any other material event
that the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary announces publicly, a report containing a description of
such event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS
as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect);
_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in_
applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as provided for in this
covenant, no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Parent. The filing of
an Annual Report on Form 20-F within the time period specified in clause (1) will satisfy such provision so
long as such report is also provided to the Trustee. At the Parent’s election it may also comply with the
provisions of this covenant by including financial statements of a Parent Holding Company of the Parent or
those of the Target (as applicable) in lieu of those for the Parent and as if references to the Parent above were
to such Parent Holding Company or the Target; _provided that, if the financial statements of such a Parent_
Holding Company or the Target (as applicable) are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of
material differences between the financial statements of such Parent Holding Company or the Target (as
applicable) and the Parent shall be included in such respect for any period commencing after the Issue Date.
During any period in which the Capital Stock of the Parent, the Target or a Parent Holding Company is listed
on a recognized stock exchange, the requirements of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled for
all purposes if the Parent, the Target or such Parent Holding Company (as applicable) complies with the
reporting requirements of such stock exchange.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if and only
if the entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 25% of the Parent’s pro forma adjusted
EBITDA as of and for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Parent, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses
(1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, either in the


-----

financial statements or in a supplement thereto, of (i) the financial condition and results of operations of the
Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries or (ii) the financial condition and results of operations of such Unrestricted Subsidiary
or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise).

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports or statement specified in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph or the second paragraph of this covenant, the Parent shall also
(a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports or statement on such website as
may be then maintained by the Parent and its Subsidiaries, which may be password protected or (ii) otherwise
to provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the Parent in good faith) or
(b) to the extent the Parent determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports or statement available in
the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially
reasonable efforts, furnish such reports or statement to the Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers
of the Senior Notes. The Parent will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through
(3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List
of the Exchange, in the manner required by the Authority.

In addition, so long as the Senior Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the
Parent is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g32(b), the Parent shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Senior Notes,
the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for
information purposes, and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any information
contained therein, including the Parent’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Senior Notes Issuer_

The Senior Notes Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease
all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Senior Notes Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
(the “Successor Senior Notes Issuer” in the case of such a transaction involving the Senior Notes
Issuer) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European
Union, the United Kingdom or the United States of America, any state or commonwealth of the United
States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or
Switzerland and the Successor Senior Notes Issuer (if not the Senior Notes Issuer) will expressly
assume (in each case subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes and the Indenture and
(b) all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Security Documents (and, to the extent required
by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Senior Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Senior Notes Issuer
as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Senior Notes Issuer or such
Subsidiary of the Successor Senior Notes Issuer, as applicable, at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) on the Relevant Testing Date, either (a) the Parent or its successor would be able to Incur at least an
additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness;” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower than it was_
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; or (c) the Relevant Leverage Ratio of the Parent
and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect to
such transaction; and


-----

(4) the Senior Notes Issuer or the Successor Senior Notes Issuer, as applicable, shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture (if any) complies with the Indenture, and that all conditions precedent provided
for therein relating to such transaction have been complied with or satisfied, and that the assumption
(if any) of obligations under clause (1) above constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Successor Senior Notes Issuer. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s
Certificate without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is
deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any
such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect
thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

For the purpose of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Parent, which properties
and assets, if held by the Parent instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Parent on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent.

The Successor Senior Notes Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right
and power of, the Senior Notes Issuer or the Parent under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture
or the Senior Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in
this sentence) and, other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph and clause (4) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Parent, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate
or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted
Subsidiary and (c) the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding
the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the
Senior Notes Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Senior Notes Issuer, reincorporating the Senior
Notes Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Senior Notes Issuer.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Guarantor that is a Subsidiary of the Parent (a “Subsidiary Guarantor”) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(A) the other Person is the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a
Guarantor concurrently with the transaction); or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes (in each case subject to any limitations
contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) all of the obligations of the


-----

Guarantor under its Senior Notes Guarantee and the Security Documents (and, to the
extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(1) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is
continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B) and the provisions described above under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence),_
(a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of
its properties and assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Subsidiary Guarantor
and (c) the Subsidiary Guarantors may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2)
(which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate
or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor reincorporating the Subsidiary Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or
changing the legal form of the Subsidiary Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Additional Senior Notes Guarantees_**

The Parent will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor (other
than the Senior Notes Issuer), directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities
Agreement (or any other Credit Facility that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or any Public Debt, in whole or in part, unless, in each case,
but subject to the Agreed Security Principles, such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on
which such other Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a
Senior Notes Guarantee, which Senior Notes Guarantee will be subordinated to any Senior Indebtedness of
such Restricted Subsidiary.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Senior Notes Guarantee.

Future Senior Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
“—The Senior Notes Guarantees.” A Senior Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the
option of the Parent if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which
was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as
at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and
the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost
of, the Parent to effectuate any release of a Senior Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject
to customary protections and indemnifications.

Each such additional Senior Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent shall not be obligated to cause any Restricted Subsidiary to
Guarantee the Senior Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior
Notes Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law or
regulation; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of,
or any measures pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection with, such Senior Notes
Guarantee, which in any case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph cannot be avoided through
measures reasonably available to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or (4) an inconsistency with the
Intercreditor Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles. The validity and enforceability of the Senior Notes
Guarantees and the security interests with respect to the Collateral and the liability of each Guarantor will be
subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Each Guarantee is subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_
_its validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Notes_
_Guarantees and Security.”_

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take any action that would have
the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of
the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to
the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Parent shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and
the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any Lien over any of the Collateral
that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens”; provided that the Parent and any Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “—
_Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred,_
used up, subject to wear or damage, or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien
in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Security
Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) to (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the
Collateral; (iv) undertake a Permitted Reorganization or Permitted Tax Restructuring or (v) make any other
change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided that (except where
permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted
Collateral Liens for the benefit of the Security Agent and holders of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance
with the Indenture), no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated or otherwise modified
or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets),
unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement or modification or release
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Parent
delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or
investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the
same asset), (2) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person
which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related
to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release, or (3) an Opinion of
Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance


-----

reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the
Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or released and replaced
are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement and to which the new Indebtedness
secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Parent, the Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to
such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Layering_**

The Parent shall not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor shall, Incur any Indebtedness that is
or purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) to be subordinated
in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is pari passu in right
of payment with the Notes Guarantee of such Guarantor or is or purports to be also by its terms (or by the terms
of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made subordinated in right of payment to that Notes Guarantee
of such Guarantor; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) distinctions between categories
of Senior Indebtedness that exist by reason of any Liens or guarantees or the ordering of payment for any Liens,
(ii) any subordination which arises by operation of law (including, without limitation, by virtue of the time of
incurrence of any relevant Indebtedness or the time of granting of any guarantee or Lien), or (iii) any
subordination which arises under or pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture; and
_provided, further, that Indebtedness under a Credit Facility that is Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor may_
provide for an ordering of payments among the tranches of such Credit Facility.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that
day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following
captions will not apply to such Senior Notes: “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments,” “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on_
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—Additional Senior Notes_
_Guarantees,” “—Layering” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described_
under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer,” and, in each case, any related default provision
of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries.
Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day
on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not be of any effect with regard to
actions of the Parent properly taken during the continuance of a Suspension Event and no default will be deemed
to have occurred solely by reason of an Applicable Transaction made during the continuance of a Suspension
Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of a Suspension Event will be
classified, at the Parent’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such
covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion
Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the
Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two
paragraphs of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed
to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The Parent shall notify the Trustee
that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition
for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify
Holders of such event.


-----

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Note when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in any payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Note issued under
the Indenture within 5 Business Days from its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon
required repurchase, including pursuant to the extent required as described under “—Deposit of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” upon declaration or otherwise;_

(3) failure by the Parent or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice
by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Senior Notes with any other agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity
of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €350,000,000 or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Parent or a Significant Subsidiary
or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary
(the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Parent or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Parent and the Restricted
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess
of €350,000,000 (exclusive of any amounts covered by indemnities provided by a solvent insurance
company or that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are
not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the receipt of notice as described in the next
succeeding paragraph after such judgment becomes final and due, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such
judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value in
excess of €350,000,000 shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release or amendment of any such security interest in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
or such Security Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid
or unenforceable or the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security


-----

interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 60 days (the “security default
**provisions”); and**

(8) any Senior Notes Guarantee of a Parent Guarantor or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Senior Notes Guarantee or the Indenture)
or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms
in writing its obligations under its Senior Notes Guarantee and any such Default continues for ten days
(the “guarantee provisions”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes notify
the Parent of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6), the Parent does not cure such default within
the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

Notwithstanding any other term of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security
Document (i) no Permitted Reorganization and (ii) no Excluded Event, shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute,
or result in, a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or any Security
Document, or a Default or an Event of Default.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Parent or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Notes by written notice to the Parent and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at
the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest,
including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration,
such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due
and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes because an Event of
Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of
acceleration of the Senior Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of
the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full,
within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Senior Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest,
including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration
of the Senior Notes, have been cured or waived. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default
or Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default or Event of Default is
received by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice
references the Senior Notes and the Indenture.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Notes
will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee
or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the
Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of
principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Note held by a non-consenting
Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Notes
and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default
is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant


-----

entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured, and any declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes resulting
therefrom shall be automatically annulled, upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or
such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified
in the Indenture.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under
the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
and, if requested, the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security and/or cost and fee cover (including by
way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability, fees or expense. Except to enforce the
right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to
the Indenture or the Senior Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have requested
in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity and/or cost and fee cover (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability, fees or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover (including by way of pre-funding);
and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or
security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or
incurred by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of
such occurrence by the Parent, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being notified by the Parent. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any,
or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers
of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Parent is
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (or in the case of the first
fiscal year of the Parent ending after the Issue Date, within 150 days of the end thereof), an Officer’s Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Parent
is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of
which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Parent is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Senior Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated (including by way of


-----

pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the
Senior Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding
the provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover (including by way of pre-funding) to it, and it
will be for Holders to take action directly.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Notes except as provided in the Indenture and
may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, such Senior Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, such Senior Notes); provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will
only amend only one series of the Senior Notes, only the consent of a majority in principal amount of the then
outstanding Senior Notes of such series shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not
less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (8) and (9) below, 75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal
amount of Senior Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Senior
Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Senior Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Note (other than provisions
relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Note or change the time at which
any such Senior Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
_Redemption,” “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” or “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory_
_Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Senior Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of
principal of, or interest or Additional Amount, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior Notes
on or after the due dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Notes in any material respect or amend the
terms of such Senior Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described
thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the covenant described under the heading “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the release of less than all or substantially all security_
interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require at
least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes) and, subject to


-----

certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for
the Senior Notes);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Senior Notes Guarantee or the Indenture,
except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to
receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Parent, any Guarantor, the
Trustee and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Senior Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Senior Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Parent or any Guarantor
under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Senior Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior Notes (provided
that the uncertificated Senior Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the
Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Senior Notes are described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B)
of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Senior Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make
any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Senior Notes) that does
not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Parent) for the issuance of
Additional Notes permitted under the Indenture;

(7) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Senior Notes Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Senior Notes Guarantees,” to add Senior Notes Guarantees with respect to the_
Senior Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Senior Notes, or to confirm and evidence the
release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the
Security Documents) with respect to or securing the Senior Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the
requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;


-----

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement,
in any property which is required by the Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date)
to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to
the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person;
_provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor_
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants— Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and_
_Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; or_

(11) as provided in “—Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements.”_

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel in forms reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Senior
Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Notes will not be rendered invalid by such
tender. The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to
Holders.

**Acts by Holders**

A Senior Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Parent, an Affiliate of the Parent, or any
fund or other entity controlled, managed or advised by any direct or indirect shareholder of the Parent (or, in
each case, any successor thereof) holds the Senior Note; provided that in determining whether the holders of
the requisite majority of outstanding Senior Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Senior Notes owned by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or Holding
Company of the Parent (or, in each case, any successor thereof) shall be disregarded and deemed not to be
outstanding if a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice of such ownership at least two
Business Days prior to the date of such determination. Prior to the receipt of such notice, the Trustee shall be
entitled to assume that none of the Senior Notes are owned by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or Holding
Company of the Parent (or in, each case, any successor thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, provision of such
notice shall not be an obligation of the Parent.

**Defeasance**

The Parent at any time may terminate all its, the Senior Notes Issuer’s and each Guarantor’s obligations
under any series of the Senior Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults
and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights,
powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Parent, the Senior
Notes Issuer and each Guarantor in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior
Notes, registration of Senior Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Parent exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the
Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will
terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Parent at any time may terminate its, the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations
under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer”


-----

and clause (A), (B) and (C) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and default provisions relating to such_
covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment
default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Parent and its Significant
Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision
described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Parent at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Parent exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
applicable series of Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such
Senior Notes. If the Parent exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to any series of the Senior
Notes, payment of such Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause
(3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer” and clauses (A), (B), (C) of the covenant described under “—_
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6) (with respect only to_
Significant Subsidiaries (other than the Senior Notes Issuer)), (7), (8) or (9) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Parent or the Senior Notes Issuer must irrevocably
deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by
the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes to
redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery
to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that beneficial
owners of the Senior Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit
and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel
must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S.
federal income tax law since the issuance of the applicable series of Senior Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Parent or the Senior Notes Issuer,
as the case may be, with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any
creditors of the Parent; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Notes and rights of the
Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Notes when (1) either (a) all the
Senior Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Notes
and certain Senior Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have
been released to the Parent) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all Senior Notes not
previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and
payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and
at the expense, of the Parent; (2) the Parent or the Senior Notes Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), money in
euro or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Notes that have become


-----

due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Parent and the Senior
Notes Issuer have paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Parent or the
Senior Notes Issuer (as the case may be) has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture
to apply the deposited money towards payment of the Senior Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as
the case may be; and (5) the Parent has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel in forms reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee each to the effect that all conditions precedent under
the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to
matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in writing
by the Parent, the Trustee and Paying Agent (which request may be included in the applicable notice of
redemption pursuant to the above referenced Officer’s Certificate) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the
Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders
shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Parent of such earlier repayment date (which
may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to
Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present
value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Notes are
represented by a global note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial
holders of such Senior Notes holding interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be subject to the
then applicable procedures of such clearing system.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel
in forms satisfactory to the Trustee without independent verification, provided that any such counsel may rely
on an Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Incorporators and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of, the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, including the Target Group, shall have any liability for any obligations of,
the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Target Group, under the Note Documents or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting
a Senior Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the Senior Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Lucid Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such
Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received
written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use
the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of
the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty. Further, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under
the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has
received, customary protections and indemnification.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Parent, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect
of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee and any agent under the Indenture will be permitted to
engage in other transactions with the Parent and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Parent and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not
eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Parent may


-----

remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition
any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
taxes (other than taxes determined or measured by net income) and expenses incurred without gross negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
the Indenture. The right of the Trustee or the Security Agent to require an Opinion of Counsel shall not imply
that the Security Agent or Trustee should seek such an Opinion of Counsel and such Security Agent or Trustee
is entitled to rely on such other evidence as it deems appropriate. Each of the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall be entitled to rely solely and conclusively on any Officer’s Certificate in formulating its opinion or in
taking any action (including, without limitation, release of a Senior Notes Guarantee or Collateral) under the
Indenture, and may rely on such Officer’s Certificate without need for investigation or verification (including
for the avoidance of doubt the receipt of Opinions of Counsel), except as may otherwise be expressly required
under the terms of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Senior Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to
them at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar.

In addition, for so long as any of the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and
if and for so long as the rules of Authority shall so require, the Parent will notify the Authority of any notice
with respect to the Senior Notes. In addition, for so long as any Senior Notes are represented by Global Notes,
all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, each of which will give such notices
to the holders of Book-Entry Interests. In addition, for so long as any Senior Notes are represented by Global
Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the third day after
being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class
mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time
prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above,
it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given via Euroclear or
Clearstream, it will be deemed to have been duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or
Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if
any, or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due
date for payment thereof. Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest
on the Senior Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for the
Senior Notes to be admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Senior Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that admission to
trading in the Senior Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Notes is not conditioned on
obtaining this listing or admission.


-----

**Currency Indemnity**

Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Parent,
any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder, any paying agent or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed
to be due to it in euro from the Parent or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Parent or such
Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the
amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient, any paying agent
or the Trustee under any Senior Note, the Parent and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss
sustained by such recipient, any paying agent or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Parent and the
Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making
any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the
matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior Note, any paying agent or the Trustee to certify in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Parent (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making
any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Parent’s and
the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder, any paying agent or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or
proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Note, any Senior Notes Guarantee or
to the Trustee.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since, as of the Issue Date, substantially all the assets of each of the Parent, the Senior Notes Issuer
and the Target Group are held by Subsidiaries located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Parent, the Senior Notes Issuer, or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect
to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price
and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Notes or the Senior Notes Guarantees, may not be collectable
within the United States.

The Netherlands does not have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final
judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil
liability would not be directly enforceable in the Netherlands. However, if the party in whose favor such final
judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in the Netherlands, such party may submit to a
Dutch court the final judgment that has been rendered in the United States. If the Dutch court finds that (a) the
jurisdiction of the court in the federal or state court in the United States has been based on grounds which are
internationally acceptable, (b) proper legal procedures have been observed, (c) the final judgment is —
according to the law of the jurisdiction of the court — formally capable of being enforced, (d) the final judgment
is not irreconcilable with a decision of a Dutch court rendered between the same parties or with an earlier
decision of a foreign court rendered between the same parties in proceedings involving the same cause, provided
that earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (e) the final judgment does not contravene public
policy in the Netherlands, the Dutch court will, in principle, give binding effect to the final judgment which has
been rendered in the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees, the Parent and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York,
County and State of New York, United States.


-----

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Senior Notes, including any Senior Notes Guarantees, and the rights and duties
of the parties thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of England. The Security Documents will be governed by the law of the
location of the relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.

**Financial Calculations**

**_Financial Testing_**

The following principles relating to the calculation of financial metrics thereof are included in the
Indenture:

(a) For the purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA (and, where applicable, any other definition,
financial ratio or test) under the Indenture for any period, the Parent shall be permitted to: (i) if since
the beginning of such period the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary has disposed of or discontinued
any company, any business or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business (any
such disposition or discontinuation, for the purposes of this definition, a “Sale”) or if the transaction
giving rise to the need to calculate Consolidated EBITDA is such a Sale, calculate Consolidated
EBITDA for such period on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA will be reduced by an amount equal
to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Sale
for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) attributable
thereto for such period, provided that if the Parent elects to make such an adjustment and the relevant
sale constitutes “discontinued operations” in accordance with IFRS, Consolidated Net Income shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if positive) attributable to such operations
for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if negative)
attributable thereto for such period; (ii) if since the beginning of such period, the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise) has made (or otherwise planned or committed, or in
respect of which any other step or action has been taken, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) an
Investment in any Person that thereby becomes (or that the Parent expects in good faith, based upon
any such plan, commitment, step or action, will become) a Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or
otherwise and including for this purpose any designation that results in an Unrestricted Subsidiary
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary), or otherwise has acquired (or that the Parent expects in good faith,
based upon any such plan, commitment, step or action, will acquire) any company, any business or
any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business (any such actual or potential Investment
or acquisition, a “Purchase”), including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a transaction
causing a calculation to be made under the Indenture, calculate Consolidated EBITDA on the basis
that Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as
if such Purchase (together with any other related action or step) occurred on the first day of such period;
(iii) in respect of any Sale or any Purchase by any Person (that became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
merged or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning
of such period, including for this purpose any Person that the Parent expects in good faith, based upon
any relevant plan, commitment, step or action referred to in paragraph (ii) above, will become a
Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise)) that would have permitted an adjustment pursuant to
paragraph (i) or (ii) above if made by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such
period, calculate Consolidated EBITDA on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA for such period will
be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Sale or Purchase (together with any other
related action or step) occurred on the first day of such period; (iv) include an adjustment in respect of
any Sale or Purchase (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Sale or Purchase contemplated by
paragraph (iii) above and any Sale or Purchase entered into in a prior period) equal to or less than the
full run rate effect of all Synergies which the Parent (acting reasonably and as calculated in good faith
by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of Group (or such other person as is performing
the functions of a financial or chief accounting officer)) believes can be obtained in the 36 month
period following that Sale or, as the case may be, Purchase as a result of such Sale or Purchase (or any
other related action or step); (v) if a definitive purchase agreement (including for this purpose any


-----

launch of a public offer or similar or equivalent step) or other contract has been entered into in respect
of an acquisition or other Investment but that acquisition or other Investment has not yet occurred,
give pro forma effect to that acquisition or Investment; (vi) give pro forma effect to any Specified
Transaction (together with any other related action or step) that has occurred during or prior to such
period (or which is otherwise planned or committed, or in respect of which any other step or action
has been taken, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise); (vii) include an adjustment in respect of each
restructuring, cost saving, operating expense reduction, operating improvement (or, in each case, other
similar initiative) or other Specified Transaction (each, together with any other related action or step,
a “Group Initiative”) implemented during or prior to such period (or otherwise planned or committed,
or in respect of which any other step or action has been taken, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise)
equal to or less than the full run rate effect of all Synergies which the Parent (acting reasonably and as
calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of Group (or such other
person as is performing the functions of a financial or chief accounting officer)) believes can be
obtained in the 36 month period following implementation of such Group Initiative as a result of that
Group Initiative (or any other related action or step); (viii) exclude any non-recurring costs and other
expenses arising directly or indirectly as a consequence of any actual or potential Sale, Purchase or
Specified Transaction (or any other related action or step) and/or the implementation of (or any other
action or step in relation to) any Group Initiative and/or (ix) give pro forma effect to any exclusion,
add-back or other matter reflected in or contemplated by, or otherwise make any adjustment consistent
with or contemplated by, the Offering Memorandum (in each case as determined by the Parent in good
faith).

(b) For the purpose of calculating the definitions set out in the Indenture: (i) all calculations will be as
determined in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of Group (or such other
person as is performing the functions of a financial or chief accounting officer), including in respect
of Synergies, run-rate effects and other pro forma adjustments; (ii) all calculations in respect of
Synergies (in each case actual or anticipated) may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such
Synergies were realized on the first day of the relevant period; (iii) all calculations in respect of an
actual or potential Specified Transaction (including to give pro forma effect to any such Specified
Transaction) may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such Specified Transaction was realized
on the first day of the relevant period; (iv) in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding on
any date of determination, pro forma effect may be given to any Incurrence, repayment, repurchase,
defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as if such transaction had
occurred on the first day of the relevant period; (v) in determining the equivalent in one currency of
any amount denominated in another currency for the purpose of compliance with Relevant Metric, the
Parent may calculate such amount using the currency equivalent of such amount; (vi) without prejudice
to any other provision for the benefit of any member of the Group, any Relevant Metric to be
determined in connection with a Relevant Transaction may, at the option of the Parent, be determined
as at the Relevant Test Date; (vii) if compliance with a Relevant Metric is established in accordance
with paragraph (vi) above, such Relevant Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or
satisfied) for all purposes, provided that: (A) the Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate
any Relevant Metric on the basis of a more recent Relevant Determination Date, in which case, such
date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Relevant Determination Date for
the purposes of such Relevant Metric; and (B) save as contemplated in sub-paragraph (A) above,
compliance with any Relevant Metric shall not be required to be determined or tested at any time after
the relevant Relevant Determination Date for such transaction and/or any actions or transactions
related thereto; (viii) in calculating the availability under any Relevant Metric in connection with any
action or transaction unrelated to the Relevant Transaction following the relevant Relevant
Determination Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Relevant Transaction is
consummated or the Parent determines (in its sole discretion) that such Relevant Transaction will not
be consummated, any such Relevant Metric may be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to
such Relevant Transaction; (ix) if, in connection with the same Relevant Transaction or otherwise
substantially simultaneously: (A) (1) any Relevant Metrics required to be determined by reference to
a fixed currency amount or a percentage of LTM EBITDA (a “fixed permission”) are intended to be
utilized and/or (2) revolving Indebtedness is intended to be Incurred; and (B) any Relevant Metrics
required to be determined by reference to the Relevant Total Leverage Ratio, the Relevant Leverage


-----

Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Relevant Metric (a “ratio-based
**permission”) are intended to be utilized (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination of**
any increase or decrease in any such Relevant Metric), then (a) amounts available to be incurred under
the applicable ratio-based permissions shall first be calculated without giving effect to amounts to be
incurred under the applicable fixed permissions or the applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness,
or amounts previously incurred under such fixed permissions and not reclassified that are being repaid
in connection with such Relevant Transaction, in each case unless otherwise elected by the Parent and
(b) thereafter, compliance with any relevant fixed permissions shall be calculated, and in each case,
full pro forma effect shall be given to all increases to LTM EBITDA and repayments or discharges of
Indebtedness in connection with such Relevant Transaction in accordance with the Indenture and
(x) subject to clause (2) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof)_
is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission (whether a fixed currency amount, a
percentage of LTM EBITDA or otherwise) and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under
a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Parent, such action, matter, transaction or
amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

(c) If the Parent relies upon the provisions of clause (ix) of the second paragraph of the provisions
described under Construction, entitling the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary to Incur Indebtedness or
a Lien or make a Restricted Payment in connection with a committed acquisition or Restricted
Payment, if it were entitled to do so on the date of the commitment, then for the purposes of calculating
the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Total Leverage Ratio and
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, such transaction and the accompanying Incurrence of Indebtedness,
a Lien or a Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have already occurred on such commitment date
(and may therefore also as appropriate be given pro forma effect as though having occurred on the first
day of the relevant period).

(d) In the event that Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income is to be calculated prior to the
end of the fourth complete Financial Quarter after the Completion Date, Consolidated EBITDA or, as
the case may be, Consolidated Net Income for any part of the applicable Relevant Period falling prior
to the date on which the Target Group became part of the Group shall be calculated on the basis that
the definition of Consolidated EBITDA or, as the case may be, Consolidated Net Income is to be
construed as if references to the Group were references to the Target Group (where applicable, with
the Consolidated EBITDA or, as the case may be, Consolidated Net Income of the Group and the
Target Group to be aggregated).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the definitions set out under “—
_Certain Definitions” or “—Financial Calculations,” when calculating any financial definition or ratio_
under the Indenture the Parent shall be permitted to exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other
negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from: (i) any
branding or rebranding of the Group (or any part thereof) and/or start-up costs for new businesses; (ii)
any Tax referable to any payments, dividends or other distributions made or declared intra-Group; (iii)
the Transaction; (iv) any other acquisition, Investment or other Joint Venture permitted by the terms
of the Indenture; (v) costs or expenses relating to employee relocation, retraining, severance and
termination, business interruption, reorganization and other restructuring or cost cutting measures, the
rationalization, re branding, start up, reduction or elimination of product lines, assets or businesses,
the consolidation, relocation or closure of retail, administrative or production locations and other
similar items (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any related capital expenditure) and/or (vi)
research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof).In addition, the Parent may
exclude the impact of any purchase accounting when calculating any financial definition or ratio under
the Indenture. In calculating any financial ratio no item shall be included or excluded more than once
where to do so would result in double counting of that item.

certain financial definitions as follows:


-----

“Capitalized Software Expenditures” means, for any period, the aggregate of all expenditures

nothing in the Indenture shall prohibit any step, action or matter arising in connection with any actual, proposed
or future payment of Tax (including as a consequence of the formation of a fiscal unity, any ‘group

doubt, if any receivable (or any part thereof) has been sold or discounted on a basis which it means it would be
treated as off balance sheet or derecognized under IFRS (as determined by the Parent in good faith), that
receivable shall be considered to have been sold or discounted on a non-recourse basis; (ix) when establishing
whether any action, transaction and/or incurrence of a liability (in each case including any replacement, renewal
or extension thereof) is, was and/or remains permitted under the terms of the Indenture, the Group shall be
entitled to rely on the fact that such action, transaction and/or incurrence was permitted at the time that action,
transaction and/or incurrence was originally taken, committed to or incurred (as the case may be) provided that,
in relation to the satisfaction of the Build Up Conditions set out in the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” if the Parent elects to rely on the provisions of this clause (ix) and make a_

construed as a reference to the Consolidated EBITDA of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis; (xi) for the purpose of calculating compliance with any basket, exception or other provision
of the Indenture, the value of any non-cash consideration shall be as determined by the Parent (acting
reasonably); (xii) for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any reference to calculating a financial ratio on a
pro forma basis, the Parent (or, as the case may be, the relevant member of the Group) shall be permitted to
make that calculation (including any adjustment) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture (including,
without limitation, by making any adjustment described in “—Financial Calculations”); (xiii) in the event that
any person ceases to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Joint Venture, any amounts which would prior to such
cessation have fallen within (and consequently reduced the amount available to the Group under) any basket or
other limit set out in the Indenture as a result of such person being a an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Joint
Venture shall be ignored for the purpose of calculating the amount available under the relevant basket or limit;
and (xiv) where a member of the Group is permitted to make an election (or similar), that member of the Group
may revoke and re-make that election (or similar) at any time and from time to time.

If in any year the aggregate amount of any annual basket set out in the Indenture (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, excluding any “at any time” baskets) (each a “Permitted Basket”) which is utilized by the Group is
less than the basket originally available for that financial year (the difference being referred to as the “Available
**Amount”), then the maximum amount of that Permitted Basket for the immediately following year (for the**
purposes of this paragraph only, the “Carry Forward Year”) shall be increased by an amount equal to the
relevant Available Amount. In any Carry Forward Year, the original amount of a Permitted Basket shall be
treated as having been applied after any Available Amount carried forward into such Carried Forward Year.
Any Permitted Basket for the next financial year may be carried back to the current financial year with a
corresponding reduction in that Permitted Basket for the next following financial year. If any basket, limit,
threshold and/or other exception set out in the Indenture is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed
amount (the “numerical permission”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the
grower permission of such basket exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time (including, without
limitation, as a result of any adjustment described in “Financial Calculations”), the numerical permission shall
be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time (as
determined by the Parent in good faith) and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the
grower permission.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or
exceptions set out in the Indenture, the Parent, in its sole discretion, may classify (and may from time to time
reclassify) that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only be required to include
that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount or
transaction may at the option of the Parent be split between different baskets or exceptions), subject however
to clause (1) of the third paragraph of the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” in relation to Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date under the Facility. In addition_
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, when establishing whether any Relevant
Transaction is, was and/or remains permitted under the terms of the Indenture, the Group shall be entitled to


-----

rely on the fact that such Relevant Transaction was permitted at the Relevant Determination Date and, if elected
by the Parent, references in the Indenture to the date of Incurrence, establishment, acquisition, Investment,
disposal, payment, designation, issuance, distribution, declaration, financing or refinancing, the date of
commitments being obtained or utilized, the date of any liability and/or obligation being outstanding and/or the
date of any transaction, step or matter or, in each case, any similar or equivalent construct shall be construed as
referring to the Relevant Determination Date in respect of the Relevant Transaction and if any related
requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for
which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Relevant Test Date would at any time after
the Relevant Determination Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or
continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have
been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have
occurred or be continuing).

revolving credit facility, unless such Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced) or
issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for
which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or simultaneously with the event for
which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
**Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such**
Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or
such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, provided that the pro forma calculation of Fixed Charges shall
not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date pursuant
to the provisions described under the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or (ii) the discharge on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date of any Indebtedness_

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investment, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, consolidations, disposed or discontinued operations, Specified Transactions, savings programs, and
Group Initiatives that have been made or implemented (or, at the election of the Parent, planned or committed
or in respect of which any other action or step has been taken) by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date, may be calculated on
a pro forma basis in a manner consistent with the adjustments described in “Financial Calculations,” including
without limitation as to savings programs and other Group Initiatives, assuming that all such Investments,
acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, consolidations, Specified Transactions, Group Initiatives and disposed or
discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in
Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom), including the full run rate effect of anticipated Synergies, had
occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person
that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made or implemented any Investment, acquisition,
disposition, merger, consolidation, Specified Transaction, Group Initiative or disposed or discontinued any
operation that would have permitted or required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio may be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto, including anticipated Synergies, for such
period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation, Specified Transaction, Group
Initiative or disposed or discontinued operation and the full run rate effect of such anticipated Synergies had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (in each case in a manner consistent with the
adjustments described in “—Financial Calculations”).

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Group (or
such other person as is performing the functions of such a role), including Synergies. If any Indebtedness bears
a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable
rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit or
similar facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during the applicable period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on
Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate,
a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually
chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Parent may designate. For the purpose of
calculating pro forma effect under this definition, pro forma effect may also be given to anticipated acquisitions
where the Indebtedness to be Incurred is to finance such acquisitions in whole or in part, which have not yet
occurred but which have become subject to a definitive purchase agreement or other contract.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this definition shall prejudice or limit the right of the Parent or
any other member of the Group to make any adjustment or calculation (whether in relation to Consolidated


-----

EBITDA, Fixed Charges, the Fixed Charge Cover Ratio or otherwise) in accordance with any other term of the
Indenture (including without limitation any adjustment described in “—Financial Calculations”).

All Applicable Metrics described in this definition will be calculated as set forth in the section “—
_Financial Calculations” above._

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of:

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation
**S Global Senior Secured Notes”).**

The Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to
Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “144A Global Senior Secured Notes”).

The Senior Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented
by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global
**Senior Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes, the “Regulation S Global**
**Notes”).**

The Senior Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to Rule
144A will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “144A Global Senior Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes, the
“144A Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Global
Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests
will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form
by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued
only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities
in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interest in the Global Notes will not have
the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will
not be considered the registered owners or “holders” of the Notes, under the Indentures for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositaries for Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indentures. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable,
and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders
under the Indentures.

Neither the Issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, nor the Trustee under the
Indentures nor any of our or their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of
the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only if:


-----

    - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the relevant Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to
act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the relevant Issuer within 120
days,

    - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indentures, or

    - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indentures.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names
and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, or the Issuers (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not
required by the Indentures or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or
a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the
transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor
or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that
a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and
are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us
to protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indentures from any loss which any of
them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the
Indentures, we, in our discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indentures and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will comply with
the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the
Registrar and their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the
applicable Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time in the register maintained by
the Registrars, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes, however, owners of the BookEntry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.


-----

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of
the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of
such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with
the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that under existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the relevant series of Notes are to be redeemed at any time,
Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate, provided, however,
that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in
part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the relevant Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying
Agent will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indentures, the Issuers, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the
Paying Agent and their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example,
Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer
Agent nor the Paying Agent or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made
by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

    - the records of the common depositary or the custodian.

Payments made by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in “street name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuers, the Trustee, the Initial
Purchasers, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents will be liable
to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to
or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders
may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, in euro.


-----

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuers that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of the Notes (including the presentation of the Notes for exchange as described above) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited
and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such participant
or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in
the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if
there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange
the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive
Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their
respective rules and operating procedures. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes
for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities
or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the
normal procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and in accordance with the provisions of the
Indentures.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes
and the closing of the offering (the “40-day Period”), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may
be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the 144A Global Note denominated
in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the
Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning
of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with all applicable securities
laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the 144A Global Note
denominated in the same currency without compliance with these certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon
receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture) from the
transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any
other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and
_Exchange” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest in one of_
the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the
other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the firstmentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests
in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest. In the event Additional Senior
Secured Notes or Additional Senior Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common
Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable,
belonging to the same series previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Senior Secured
Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry


-----

Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Senior Secured
Notes or Additional Senior Notes, as applicable, will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a
144A Global Note (if any) representing Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, of that same series.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” or
“Description of the Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange,” as applicable, and, if required, only if the transferor
first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the
Registrars and the Transfer Agents nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective agents are responsible
for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic
book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants,
among others, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and/or Clearstream
is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodian relationship with a Euroclear and/or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently,
the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial
interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global
Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global
Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with
their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent,
the Registrar, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.


-----

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear
or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

Application will be made to the Authority for the Notes represented by the Global Notes to be listed
on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange. We expect
that secondary trading in the Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws, and unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered, sold, pledged
or otherwise transferred within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of any U.S. persons (as
defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and, in certain_
_instances, holding of the Notes by (i) “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the U.S._
_Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) that are subject to Title I of ERISA,_
_(ii) plans described in Section 4975 of the Code which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including an_
_individual retirement account (“IRA”) and a “Keogh” plan) or provisions under other U.S. or non-U.S._
_federal, state, local or other laws or regulations that are similar to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited_
_transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and (iii)_
_entities whose underlying assets are considered to include the assets of any of the foregoing described in clauses_
_(i) and (ii), pursuant to ERISA or otherwise (each of the foregoing described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) referred_
_to herein as a “Plan”)._

**General fiduciary matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (each, a “Covered Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving
the assets of a Covered Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any
person who exercises discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Covered Plan or the
management or disposition of the assets of a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation to a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan.

When considering an investment in the Notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan
including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited transaction issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an
exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code, and
may result in the disqualification of an IRA. In addition, the fiduciary of the Plan that engaged in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which an Issuer, a
Guarantor, an Initial Purchaser or certain of their respective affiliates is considered a party in interest or a
disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an
applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. Included among these statutory
exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code, which exempt certain
transactions (including, without limitation, a sale and purchase of securities) between a Covered Plan and a
party in interest so long as (i) such party in interest is treated as such solely by reason of providing services to
the Covered Plan, (ii) such party in interest is not a fiduciary which renders investment advice, or has or
exercises discretionary authority or control, with respect to the assets of the Covered Plan involved in such
transaction, or an affiliate of any such person and (iii) the Covered Plan neither receives less than nor pays more
than “adequate consideration” (as defined in such Sections) in connection with such transaction. In addition,
the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to
the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14
respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting
insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE
95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined
by in-house asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its
application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on these


-----

or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption in consultation with its legal advisers to assure
the exemption is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will
be satisfied.

Plans that are government plans, foreign plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the
prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be
subject to Similar Laws. Any fiduciary of such a Plan considering an investment in the Notes should consult
with its legal advisers before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine
the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representations**

Accordingly, by its acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and holder of the Notes, and subsequent
transferee of a Note will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) such purchaser or
subsequent transferee is not, and is not using the assets of, a Plan to acquire or hold the Note or any interest
therein or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition of a Note by such purchaser or transferee does not, and
will not, constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of
the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing
and/or holding of the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their legal advisers
regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar Law and whether an
exemption would be required. Neither this discussion nor anything provided in this Offering Memorandum is,
or is intended to be, investment advice directed at any potential Plan purchasers, or at Plan purchasers generally,
and such purchasers of the Notes should consult and rely on their own counsel and advisers as to whether an
investment in the Notes is suitable for the Plan.

Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding
of the Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and applicable Similar Laws and does
not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws. We make no
representation as to whether an investment in the Notes is appropriate for any Plan in general or whether such
investment is appropriate for any particular Plan.

Plans, including IRAs and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, should
consider the fact that none of the Transaction Parties is acting as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the
decision to purchase the Notes in connection with the initial offer and sale hereunder. The Transaction Parties
are not undertaking to provide investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give
advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision to purchase the Notes. All communications,
correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the initial offer and sale hereunder
are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not
constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision
to purchase the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan on an arm’s length basis.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a general description of certain Netherlands and United States federal income tax_
_considerations relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. It does not purport to be a_
_complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes, whether in those countries specifically_
_addressed below or elsewhere. Prospective purchasers of Notes should consult their tax advisors as to which_
_countries’ tax laws could be relevant to acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes and receiving payments of_
_interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes, and the consequences of such actions under the tax_
_laws of those countries. This summary is based upon the law as in effect on the date of this Offering_
_Memorandum and is subject to any change in law that may take effect after such date whether or not such_
_change in law has retroactive effect._

Investors should also note that the appointment by an investor in Notes, or any person through which
an investor holds Notes, of a custodian, collection agent or similar person in relation to such Notes in any
jurisdiction may have tax implications. Investors should consult their tax advisors in relation to the tax
consequences for them of any such appointment.

**Certain Netherlands Tax Considerations**

This is a general summary and the tax consequences as described here may not apply to any particular
holder of Notes. Any potential investors should consult their own tax advisers for more information about the
tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Notes in their particular circumstances.

This taxation summary solely addresses the principal Netherlands tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposal of Notes issued by the Issuers after the date hereof and held by a holder of Notes who
is not a resident of The Netherlands. It does not consider every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to a
particular holder of Notes under special circumstances or who is subject to special treatment under applicable
law. Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Netherlands concepts, the
meaning to be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent
Netherlands concepts under Netherlands tax law.

This summary is based on the tax laws of The Netherlands as they are in force and in effect on the date
of this Offering Memorandum. The Netherlands means the European part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands.
The laws upon which this summary is based are subject to change, potentially with retroactive effect. A change
to such laws may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect any such change.
This summary assumes that each transaction with respect to Notes is at arm’s length.

This summary does not address The Netherlands tax consequences for a holder of Notes that is
considered to be affiliated (gelieerd) to (one of) the Issuer(s) (or Guarantor(s)) within the meaning of The
Netherlands Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021). Generally, a holder of notes is considered
to be affiliated to an Issuer (or Guarantor) for these purposes if (i) it has a qualifying interest in an Issuer (or
Guarantor), (ii) an Issuer (or Guarantor) has a qualifying interest in such party, or (iii) a third party has a
qualifying interest in both an Issuer (or Guarantor) and such party. For these purposes, a party is equated with
any collaborating group of parties of which it forms part. A qualifying interest is an interest that allows the
holder to have a decisive influence over the other party’s decisions, in such a way that it is able to determine
the activities of the other party. A party is in any case considered to have a qualifying interest in another party
if it (directly or indirectly) owns more than 50% of the voting rights in such other party.

This summary does not address the tax consequences of any holder of Notes who is a resident of any
non-European part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands.

**_Withholding Tax_**

All payments by the Issuers and the Guarantors under Notes can be made free of withholding or
deduction of any taxes of whatever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by The Netherlands or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.


-----

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

A holder of Notes will not be subject to any Netherlands taxes on income or capital gains in respect of
Notes, including such tax on any payment under Notes or in respect of any gain realized on the disposal, deemed
disposal or exchange of Notes, provided that:

(i) such holder is neither a resident nor deemed to be a resident of The Netherlands;

(ii) such holder does not have an enterprise or an interest in an enterprise that is, in whole
or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative in The Netherlands, and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise,
as the case may be, Notes are attributable;

(iii) if such holder is an individual, neither such holder nor any of the holder’s spouse,
partner, a person deemed to be the holder’s partner, or other persons sharing such
holder’s house or household, or certain other of such holder’s relatives (including
foster children), whether directly and/or indirectly as (deemed) settlor, grantor or
similar originator (the **Settlor), or upon the death of the Settlor, the Settlor’s**
beneficiaries (the Beneficiaries) in proportion to their entitlement to the estate of
the Settlor, of a trust, foundation or similar arrangement (a Trust), (a) indirectly has
control of the proceeds of Notes in The Netherlands, nor (b) has a substantial interest
in an Issuer (or Guarantor) and/or any other entity that legally or de facto, directly
or indirectly, has control of the proceeds of Notes in The Netherlands. For purposes
of this clause (iii), a substantial interest is generally not present if a holder does not
hold, alone or together with the holder’s spouse, partner, a person deemed to be such
holder’s partner, other persons sharing such holder’s house or household, certain
other of such holder’s relatives (including foster children), or a Trust of which the
holder or any of the aforementioned persons is a Settlor or a Beneficiary, whether
directly or indirectly, (a) the ownership of, certain other rights, such as usufruct,
over, or rights to acquire (whether or not already issued), shares representing five
per cent. or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and
outstanding capital of any class of shares) of a company; (b) the ownership of, or
certain other rights, such as usufruct, over profit participating certificates
(winstbewijzen), or membership rights in a co-operative association, that relate to
five per cent. or more of the annual profit of a company or co-operative association
or to five per cent. or more of the liquidation proceeds of a company or co-operative
association; or (c) membership rights representing five per cent. or more of the
voting rights in a co-operative association’s general meeting;

(iv) if such holder is a company, such holder has no (deemed) substantial interest in an
Issuer (or Guarantor), or if such holder has a (deemed) substantial interest in an
Issuer (or Guarantor), (a) such substantial interest is not held with the avoidance of
Netherlands income tax as (one of) the main purpose(s), or (b) such substantial
interest does not form part of an artificial structure or series of structures (such as
structures which are not put into place for valid business reasons reflecting economic
reality). For purposes of this clause (iv), a substantial interest is generally not present
if a holder does not hold, whether directly or indirectly, (a) the ownership of, certain
other rights, such as usufruct, over, or rights to acquire (whether or not already
issued) shares representing five per cent. or more of the total issued and outstanding
capital (or of the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares) of a company;
or (b) the ownership of, or certain other rights, such as usufruct, over profit
participating certificates (winstbewijzen) that relate to five per cent. or more of the
annual profit of a company or to five per cent. or more of the liquidation proceeds
of a company. A holder of Notes will generally have a deemed substantial interest if
such holder has the ownership of, or other rights over, shares in, or profit certificates
issued by, a company that represent less than five per cent. of the relevant aggregate
that either (a) qualified as part of a substantial interest as set forth above and where


-----

shares, profit certificates and/or rights thereover have been, or are deemed to have
been, partially disposed of, or (b) have been acquired as part of a transaction that
qualified for non-recognition of gain treatment; and

(v) if such holder is an individual, such income or capital gain does not form a “benefit
from miscellaneous activities” in The Netherlands (resultaat uit overige
_werkzaamheden) which, for instance, would be the case if the activities in The_
Netherlands with respect to Notes exceed “normal active asset management”
(normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) or if income and gains are derived from the
holding, whether directly or indirectly, of (a combination of) shares, debt claims or
other rights (a “lucrative interest,” _lucratief belang) that the holder thereof has_
acquired under such circumstances that such income and gains are intended to be
remuneration for work or services performed by such holder (or a related person) in
The Netherlands, whether within or outside an employment relation, where such
lucrative interest provides the holder thereof, economically speaking, with certain
benefits that have a relation to the relevant work or services.

**_Gift, Estate or Inheritance Taxes_**

No gift, estate or inheritance taxes will arise in The Netherlands with respect to an acquisition of Notes
by way of a gift by, or on the death of, a holder who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands for Netherlands inheritance and gift tax purposes, unless in the case of a gift of Notes by an
individual who at the date of the gift was neither resident nor deemed to be resident in The Netherlands, such
individual dies within 180 days after the date of the gift, while being resident or deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands.

For purposes of Netherlands gift and inheritance tax, an individual with The Netherlands nationality
will be deemed to be resident in The Netherlands if such individual has been resident in The Netherlands at any
time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or the individual’s death.

For purposes of Netherlands gift tax, an individual not holding The Netherlands nationality will be
deemed to be resident in The Netherlands if such individual has been resident in The Netherlands at any time
during the twelve months preceding the date of the gift.

For purposes of Netherlands gift and inheritance tax, a gift that is made under a condition precedent is
deemed to have been made at the moment such condition precedent is satisfied. If the condition precedent is
fulfilled after the death of the donor, the gift is deemed to be made upon the death of the donor.

For purposes of Netherlands gift, estate and inheritance taxes, (i) a gift by a Trust will be construed as
a gift by the Settlor, and (ii) upon the death of the Settlor, as a rule, the Settlor’s Beneficiaries will be deemed
to have inherited directly from the Settlor. Subsequently, the Beneficiaries will be deemed the Settlor of the
Trust for purposes of The Netherlands gift, estate and inheritance tax in case of subsequent gifts or inheritances.

**_Value Added Tax_**

There is no Netherlands value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue
of Notes, the payment of interest or principal under Notes, or the transfer of Notes.

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

There is no Netherlands registration tax, capital tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable
in The Netherlands by a holder of Notes in respect of or in connection with the execution, delivery and/or
enforcement by legal proceedings (including any foreign judgment in the courts of The Netherlands) of the
Notes or the performance of the obligations of the Issuers under the Notes.


-----

**_Residence_**

A holder of Notes will not be treated as a resident of The Netherlands by reason only of the holding of
Notes or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of Notes.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes. This summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets
(within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) by U.S.
holders (as defined below) who purchase the Notes for cash pursuant to this offering at the offering price
indicated on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum.

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for United States federal
income tax purposes, any of the following:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

    - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or
more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under
applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person for United
States federal income tax purposes.

If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes
holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities
of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Notes,
you should consult your tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the United States
federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:

    - a broker or dealer in securities or currencies;

    - a financial institution;

    - a regulated investment company;

    - a real estate investment trust;

    - a tax-exempt organization;

    - an insurance company;

    - a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale
transaction or a straddle;

    - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting;


-----

    - a partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement (or an investor in such an entity or
arrangement);

    - an accrual method taxpayer required to recognize income for United States federal income tax
purposes no later than when such income is taken into account in applicable financial statements;

    - a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or

    - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and
judicial decisions in effect as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive
basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below.
We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the matters
discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are different from those discussed below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare contribution
tax on net investment income, the alternative minimum tax or the effects of United States federal tax laws other
than income tax laws or of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should
not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular purchaser of Notes.

**If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the**
**particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and**
**disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other United States federal tax**
**laws (such as estate or gift tax laws) and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**_Effect of Certain Contingencies._** In certain circumstances, the Issuers may be obligated to pay
amounts in excess of stated interest and principal on the Notes or to redeem the Notes prior to their scheduled
maturity (see, e.g., “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”)._
The potential obligation to make these excess payments or early redemptions may implicate the provisions of
the United States Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” The Issuers believe
and intend to take the position (to the extent they are required to take a position) that the foregoing contingencies
should not cause the Notes to be subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules. The Issuers’ position
is binding on you unless you disclose that you are taking a contrary position in the manner required by applicable
United States Treasury regulations. However, the position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to
successfully challenge this position, the timing, character and amount of income with respect to the Notes may
be materially and adversely different than the treatment described below. The remainder of this discussion
assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. You are urged to consult
your own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument
rules and the consequences thereof.

**_IPO Pushdown. A pushdown in relation to an IPO Event (as described in “Description of the Senior_**
_Secured Notes—IPO Pushdown” and “Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Pushdown”) could result in a_
taxable exchange of the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes, in which case you may recognize
gain or loss on the Notes (although any such loss may be disallowed) at such time equal to the difference, if
any, between the issue price of the deemed newly issued Notes (as determined for United States federal income
tax purposes) and your adjusted tax basis in the Notes, and have a new holding period and tax basis in the Notes.
Any such gain or loss would be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement,
_Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes.” If the fair market value of the Notes at the time of such_
taxable exchange were lower than their stated principal amount by more than a de minimis amount, the Notes
would be treated as newly issued with original issue discount, in which case you may be required to include
original issue discount as ordinary income as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) in advance of the
receipt of cash. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the potential United States federal income tax
consequences to you in the event of a pushdown in relation to an IPO Event.


-----

**_Payments of Interest. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Note will_**
generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method
of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the Notes (which includes
any foreign tax withheld), you will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of
any foreign tax withheld. You may be entitled to deduct or credit any foreign withholding tax, subject to certain
limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign
taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any additional amounts) on a Note will generally be
considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, will generally be
considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a United States foreign tax credit for foreign
taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during
which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the United States foreign tax credit are
complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the United States foreign tax
credit (or deduction in lieu of such credit) under your particular circumstances. It is expected, and the remainder
of this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be issued with original issue discount for United States federal
income tax purposes.

Interest on the Notes will be payable in euro. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United
States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S.
dollar value of the amount of interest received on the Notes, determined by translating the euro received at the
spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted into U.S. dollars on such date. A cash basis U.S. holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with
respect to the receipt of a payment of interest in euro (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition
of the euro so received).

If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes or you are
otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt, you may determine the amount of income recognized with
respect to interest on the Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method you will be
required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest
that has accrued on the Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average spot
rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued. Under the
second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate of exchange on:

    - the last day of the accrual period;

    - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or

    - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five (5) business days of the last
day of the accrual period.

If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt
instruments held by you from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In addition, if
you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon the
sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued
but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize exchange gain or loss in an amount equal
to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro
received at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the
interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above),
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollar at such time. Any such exchange gain or
loss will generally be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes. Upon the sale,_**
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, you will generally recognize gain or
loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as
interest income to the extent not previously included in income as discussed above in “—Payments of Interest”)
and your adjusted tax basis in such Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be your U.S. dollar
cost for that Note. If you purchased your Note with euro, your U.S. dollar cost will generally be the U.S. dollar


-----

value of the euro paid for such Note determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such purchase (or,
in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual method taxpayer, the settlement date of the purchase, if the Note
is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). If your
Note is sold, exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable disposition for euro, then your
amount realized will generally be based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of such sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual method
taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, if the
Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). If
an accrual method U.S. holder makes the special election to use the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date
of the purchase (in determining its U.S. dollar cost) or disposition (in determining its amount realized) of a
Note, the election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. holder from year to
year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method U.S. holder that does not make
the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss upon the taxable disposition of a Note for euro to the
extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date. Any such
exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss.

Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any
gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or
loss if you have held the Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders
(including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of
the Note will generally be treated as exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as
United States source ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your
purchase price for the Note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss
realized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the
spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
the Note, and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate of exchange on the
date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual method taxpayers, the
settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established
securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). The amount of exchange gain or loss realized
on the disposition of the Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount
of overall gain or loss realized on such disposition of the Note.

**_Disposition of Euro. Your tax basis in euro received as interest on a Note or on the sale, exchange,_**
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot
rate of exchange in effect on the date the euro are received. Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale,
exchange or other taxable disposition of the euro will generally be treated as United States source ordinary
income or loss.

**_Additional Notes. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may issue Additional Senior Secured Notes under_**
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Issuer may issue Additional Senior Notes under the
Senior Notes Indenture. Even if these Additional Senior Secured Notes or Additional Senior Notes are treated
as part of the same series as the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, for non-tax purposes,
in some cases they may be treated as a separate series for United States federal income tax purposes. For
instance, Additional Senior Secured Notes or Additional Senior Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time
to time may be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as
Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, belonging to the same series previously issued under the
relevant Indenture, without being fungible with such series of Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as
applicable, for United States federal income tax purposes. If you are considering the purchase of Notes sold
pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of Notes or in the secondary market, you should consult your
tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of Additional Senior
Secured Notes or Additional Senior Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes issued


-----

under the relevant Indenture for United States federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not
capable of being separately identified.

**_Reportable Transactions. United States Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require_**
the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded
as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the United States Treasury regulations,
certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note or euro received in respect of a Note to the extent
that such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a
threshold amount. If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your tax advisors to
determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

If you are an individual and own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess
of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year, you generally are required to file an information
report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with your tax return. If you do not file a required IRS Form
8938, you may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection
of all United States federal income taxes for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three
years after the date on which such report is filed. The Notes will generally constitute specified foreign financial
assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial
institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. Generally, information reporting requirements will_**
apply to all payments of interest and principal on a Note or the proceeds from a sale or other disposition
(including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient and, when
required, demonstrate this fact. Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number or, in
the case of interest payments, if you fail either to report in full dividend and interest income or to make certain
certifications, you may be subject to backup withholding on any such payments or proceeds.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) by
and among, _inter alios_ the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers, the Issuers have agreed to sell to each Initial
Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuers, together
with all other Initial Purchasers, the entire aggregate principal amount of the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price indicated on the
cover page hereof. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. Sales in
the United States will be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers, which are registered with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission as U.S. registered broker dealers.

In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuers and the Guarantors have agreed that:

    - subject to certain exceptions, neither the Issuers nor any of their respective subsidiaries will offer,
sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any of their debt securities, or guarantee such debt
securities (other than the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and any intercompany debt), without the
prior written consent of the Representatives (as defined therein), for a period of 45 days after the
Issue Date; and

    - each of the Issuers and the Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute
to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

Each purchaser of Notes offered by this Offering Memorandum, in making its purchase, will be
deemed to have made the acknowledgements, representations and agreements as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**Selling Restrictions**

The Notes may not be offered to the public within any jurisdiction. By accepting delivery of this
Offering Memorandum, you agree not to offer, sell, resell, transfer or deliver, directly or indirectly, any Note
to the public.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by
us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction
where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the
Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_United Kingdom_**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser represents warrants and agrees that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) received by it in


-----

connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the
FSMA does not apply to the Issuers; and

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**_United States of America_**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons
except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to certain persons in offshore transactions
in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this offering and (ii) the
issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale within the United States of Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation
S by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements for the U.S.
Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. For a description of certain further restrictions on
resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Initial Purchasers have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge
or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale,
pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities
Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the
Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market. In
addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” The Issuers will apply for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange and to be_
admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be
approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The Notes may not become, or_
_remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange.”_

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not
obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their
sole discretion. In addition, such market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S.
Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will
develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you
receive when you sell will be favorable.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp
taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

Each Initial Purchaser has also agreed in the Purchase Agreement that it will (to the best of its
knowledge and belief) comply with all applicable securities laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in
which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers Notes or possesses or distributes this Offering Memorandum, and
will obtain any consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer, sale or delivery by it of
the Notes under the laws and regulations in force.

In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage
in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the
price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the offering of
the Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover
the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for
and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose
penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market
levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and


-----

may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading
markets for, the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions
and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales
in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing
transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a
specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a
selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased
in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced,
may be discontinued at any time.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and
may enter into in the future investment banking, financial advisory and/or lending and commercial banking
transactions with, and/or may perform other services for, to us and/or our affiliates in the ordinary course of
business for which they have received or may receive customary fees, commissions and reimbursement of
expenses (including acting as initial purchasers and/or lenders in connection with previous issuances of debt
securities and debt facilities of the Issuers and their affiliates). In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers have
provided the Sponsors, the Company and the Issuers with M&A advisory services in connection with the
Acquisition for which they have received fees and commission. In connection with our strategy to review and
evaluate selective acquisitions and other business combinations or strategic transactions, we and our
shareholders regularly engage mergers and acquisition advisors and other financial advisors to assist us. Certain
of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may be currently advising us or other interested parties, and the
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may advise us or other interested parties from time to time on other
transactions in the future. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are party to certain of
our hedging arrangements and other financing and/or debt arrangements and may hold other proprietary
positions in us, our current or future subsidiaries and affiliates and/or financial intermediaries and the financial
instruments issued by any of them.

Depending on market conditions, the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a
portion of the Notes for their own account.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the fifth business day (as such term
is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes. Trades
in the secondary market generally settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next two
succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade
to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own
advisors.

**The Purchase Agreement between the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers will not restrict the**
**ability of the Parent or any of its affiliates to buy or sell Notes in the future and, as a result, the Parent**
**or any of its affiliates may buy or sell the Notes in open market transactions at any time following the**
**consummation of the offering of the Notes.**

**In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their**
**respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity**
**securities (and/or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their**
**own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investments and securities activities may**
**involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers and their respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers**
**and/or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express**
**independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or**


-----

**recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.**
**Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under: (i) the Senior**
**Facilities Agreement; (ii) the Bridge Facilities Agreement, all of the outstanding amounts of which are**
**being repaid with the proceeds from this offering of Notes, and such entities have received or will receive**
**customary fees for their services in such capacities.**

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON NOTES**

**GUARANTEES AND SECURITY**

The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Notes
Guarantees and the Collateral in The Netherlands (being the jurisdiction in which the Issuers and the Guarantors
are organized) as well as a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch law for
informational purposes only.

This summary does not address all the Dutch legal considerations that may be relevant to holders and
it does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity
and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral. Proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a
similar event could be initiated in any of the jurisdictions of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes.

Prospective investors should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and
considerations.

**Insolvency Law Considerations**

**_European Union_**

The Issuers and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of The Netherlands and, therefore,
under the laws of member states of the European Union (each a “Member State” and together the “Member
**States”).**

_Determination of a debtor’s COMI: main insolvency proceedings and secondary insolvency proceedings_

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings recast (the “New
**EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts of**
the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as this term is used in Article 3(1) of the New
EU Insolvency Regulation, which is further discussed below) is situated (the “COMI”) have jurisdiction to
commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor.

The New EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency
proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the New EU Insolvency Regulation that, as regards The
Netherlands, includes, among others, the insolvency proceedings, court-approved refinancing agreements, outof-court payment proceedings and anticipated arrangement proposals.

The determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

In accordance with Article 3(1) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, the COMI of a company is
presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary.
This presumption only applies if such company’s registered office has not been moved to another Member State
within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

However, it is possible to rebut this presumption “where the company’s central administration is
_located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all_
_the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, that the company’s actual_
_centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member_
_State” (preamble 30 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation)._

Prior to June 26, 2017, when the New EU Insolvency Regulation came into effect, the courts have
taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a company’s COMI, including in particular where
board meetings are held, the location where such company conducts the majority of its business or has its head
office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established.

A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and it may change from time to time, but it is determined for
the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time


-----

of the filing of the insolvency petition unless (as set forth above) the registered office has been moved within
the 3-month period prior to the filing of the insolvency petition.

The New EU Insolvency Regulation distinguishes between:

    - main insolvency proceedings, which have universal scope and are aimed at encompassing all the
debtor’s assets, and

    - secondary insolvency proceedings, which run in parallel with the main insolvency proceedings
and are limited to the assets located in a different Member State to that in which the debtor has its
COMI.

Main insolvency proceedings in respect of a debtor may be commenced in the jurisdiction of the
Member State (other than Denmark) where such debtor has its COMI and, therefore, a court in such jurisdiction
would be entitled to commence any of the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A of the New
EU Insolvency Regulation, including those mentioned above. Those main insolvency proceedings commenced
in one Member State under the New EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States
(other than Denmark).

Secondary (or ‘territorial’) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State
against the same debtor, but only if such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member
State. An “establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation to mean a place of
operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open
main insolvency proceedings non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.

Depending on whether the main insolvency proceedings commence prior to or after the
commencement of secondary insolvency proceedings, the following scenarios should be noted:

    - where main insolvency proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which a debtor has
its COMI, any insolvency proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State shall be
secondary insolvency proceedings; and

    - where main insolvency proceedings in the Member State in which a debtor has its COMI have not
yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be opened in such other
Member State where such debtor has an establishment in the event that either (a) main insolvency
proceedings cannot be opened because of the conditions laid down by the law of the Member State
within the territory of which the debtor’s COMI is situated; or (b) the opening of territorial
insolvency proceedings is requested by (x) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection
with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the
opening of territorial proceedings is requested; or (y) a public authority which, under the law of
the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request
the opening of insolvency proceedings.

When main insolvency proceedings are opened, any territorial insolvency proceedings which were
commenced prior to that date shall become secondary insolvency proceedings.

Accordingly, the courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of
the court opening the main insolvency proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member
States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner
appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings (because
the relevant debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State
in another Member State (such as to remove assets of such debtor from that other Member State) subject to
certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any
preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other
Member State where the relevant debtor has assets.


-----

In order to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency practitioner in the
main insolvency proceedings may also give a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the
Member State in which secondary proceedings could be opened that, when distributing assets or realization
proceeds, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under national law that creditors would have if
secondary proceedings were opened in that Member State. This, however, is subject to a “qualified majority”
(as defined under national law) of known local creditors (being creditors whose claims against a debtor arose
from or in connection with the operation of an establishment situated in a Member State other than the Member
State in which the debtor’s COMI is located) approving the undertaking. The law applicable to the distribution
of proceeds and ranking of claims is also the law of the state where secondary insolvency proceedings are
opened.

Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings,
such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus (i.e. the local_
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor).

Following the entry into force of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in
situations where there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a debtor’s COMI has shifted in the preceding 3
months, the rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply.
Moreover, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (which will no longer be
limited only to “winding-up proceedings”) will be possible not only if the relevant debtor has an establishment
in such Member State at the time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if such debtor had an
establishment in such Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency
proceedings.

Please note that jurisdictions outside the European Union may not require a COMI shift in order for a
Dutch company to make a filing in those jurisdictions (similar to the UK with respect to schemes of
arrangements). Yet, recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings not based on COMI or a reasonable
connection of an equivalent nature in The Netherlands should not be possible and, in addition, any creditor
could file for a non-main insolvency proceeding in The Netherlands.

_Insolvency proceedings of members of a group of companies_

As the Issuers and the Guarantors are members of a group of companies, it is noteworthy that Chapter
V of the New EU Insolvency Regulation (Articles 56 et seq.) has introduced a process by which a group of
companies experiencing difficulties may commence group coordination proceedings featuring the appointment
of a single insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency
proceedings of that group’s members. Under Article 61 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, group
coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency
proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in the insolvency proceedings
opened in relation to a member of the group. In any event, participation in group proceedings and adherence to
the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations of a Reorganization Plan (defined below) is
voluntary.

_Third-parties’ rights in rem_

The New EU Insolvency Regulation also provides for some important rules regarding the rights of
secured creditors, in particular under Article 8, according to which the opening of insolvency proceedings shall
not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third-parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or
immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time
to time, belonging to the debtor which are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of
the opening of proceedings.

In particular, these rights in rem shall mean:

(a) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the
proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;


-----

(b) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of
the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

(c) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or
use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and

(d) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The right, recorded in a public register and enforceable against third-parties, based on which a right in
_rem within the meaning of Article 8 (1) may be obtained, shall be considered to be a right in rem._

These provisions under Article 8(1) shall not preclude actions for voidness, voidability or
unenforceability as referred to in point (m) of Article 7(2) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation.

_Brexit_

The UK is no longer a member of the EU and ceased to be treated as such at 11:00 p.m. (London time)
on December 31, 2020. Amongst other implications is that, generally speaking, the provisions of the New EU
Insolvency Regulation (including, in particular, those providing for automatic, mutual recognition of insolvency
proceedings) no longer apply as between the UK and Member States. Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters (recast)), and the 2007 Lugano Convention (on jurisdiction and the recognition
and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters), which had previously been considered as
potential bases on which UK schemes of arrangement might be recognized in Member States, also generally
ceased to apply to the UK.

As a result, the issue of whether UK insolvency and restructuring proceedings would be recognized in
Member States, and vice versa, has become materially more uncertain and complex. In the UK, there remains
a framework for the recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in, and/or judgments of the courts of, a
Member State, including under the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (subject to the satisfaction of the
relevant threshold requirements). Recognition in any Member State of UK insolvency or restructuring
proceedings will be a question of the domestic laws of that country, including applicable EU law. Certain
Member States have adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, which may allow for
the recognition of UK insolvency proceedings on a similar basis to UK recognition of foreign insolvency
proceedings under the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006. Depending on the relevant circumstances,
UK restructuring proceedings may still be recognized in a Member State under the Hague Convention on Choice
of Court Agreements, EC Regulation 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I), and/or
under private international law rules applicable in that country. In summary, however, recognition of insolvency
and restructuring proceedings as between the UK and Member States is no longer automatic and there is
increased risk that recognition will not be forthcoming in all relevant jurisdictions. This may necessitate parallel
proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, which could result in increased costs, delay and potential inconsistency
in approach or outcome.

**_The Netherlands_**

_Insolvency_

The Issuers are incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands. In the event of insolvency of a Dutch
company having its center of main interests in The Netherlands, any insolvency proceedings relating to such
company would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law. Under certain circumstances, secondary or territorial
bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law against companies
that are not established under Dutch law provided that such company has an establishment in The Netherlands.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law.

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, suspension of payments
(surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the


-----

debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate
and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often
results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A
general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below.

_Suspension of payments_

An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself. Once the request
for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of
payments and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder) and often also a supervisory judge (rechter_commissaris). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension. If a draft composition_
(ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for suspension of payments, a court can order
that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the
composition is accepted and subsequently confirmed by a court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension
ends as soon as the court’s decision becomes final. The definitive suspension will generally be granted unless
(i) a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’
meeting or more than one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured
non-preferential creditors withholds its consent, (ii) there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the
creditors during a suspension of payments or (iii) there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its
creditors in the (near) future. The requirement of the debtor having to be able to satisfy its creditors does not
mean that such creditors must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for
example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition).

Suspension of payments has retroactive effect from midnight of the day on which the suspension of
payments is declared. Furthermore, the suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured nonpreferential creditors. Secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may
enforce their rights against assets of the company in a suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there
were no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that
does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, pursuant to article 241a Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(Faillissmentswet) a court may order a “cooling-off period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two
months (and potentially an additional two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential
creditors are barred. Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to
creditors. A composition will generally be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is
(i) approved by a simple majority of the recognized and of the admitted creditors present or represented at the
meeting representing at least 50% of the amount of the recognized and of the admitted claims, and
(ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by a court. Under certain conditions, a court or supervisory judge
(rechter-commissaris) (as the case may be) may derogate from this procedure. Consequently, Dutch insolvency
law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring. Interest payments
that fall due after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.

_Bankruptcy_

Bankruptcy can be applied for either by the debtor itself or by a creditor, in each case if the debtor has
ceased to pay its debts as they fall due. This is deemed to be the case if the debtor has at least two creditors (at
least one of which has a claim that is due and payable and remains unpaid). Furthermore, the Public Prosecution
Service (Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public
interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the
managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come
due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of
creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (as described above). Like a
suspension of payments, bankruptcy has retroactive effect from midnight of the day on which the bankruptcy
is declared.

Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims.
Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a Dutch bankruptcy trustee (curator) and a supervisory
judge (rechter-commissaris) are appointed. The bankruptcy trustee is charged with the administration and


-----

liquidation of the bankruptcy estate and acts under the supervision of the supervisory judge. Under Dutch law,
as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor will be
terminated by operation of law and all attachments on the debtor’s assets will be released by operation of law.
Legal proceedings to procure payment from the estate that are pending on the date of the bankruptcy order are
automatically stayed.

The basic principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal
treatment) which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy
proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, creditors with collateral
security (zakelijke zekerheidsrechten) over assets in a bankruptcy estate are able to exercise their rights as if no
formal insolvency procedure has occurred and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs.

Furthermore, certain preferred creditors (such as, but without limitation, the tax and social security
authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. In general, under Dutch
law, rights of mortgage and pledge rank above such other rights of priority, including the general priority right
of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, this is subject to exceptions. Under certain
circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on machinery and
inventory (not including stock (voorraden)) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). In addition,
a pledgee is obligated to notify the Dutch tax authorities of (i) its intention to exercise its rights under a pledge
on movable property (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken) within the
meaning of the Tax Collection Act (Invorderingswet 1990), or (ii) its intention to perform, to procure in any
way the performance of, or cooperate with any legal of factual act with respect to such property which could
prejudice the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right to such property. Following such notification, a statutory
waiting period of up to four weeks starting from the date of notification has to be observed. In the four weeks
following such notification, the pledgee may not exercise its security rights in respect of such assets or perform
any action with respect to such assets which could prejudice the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right. During
this waiting period, the Dutch tax authorities may exercise their priority right in respect of specific property for
certain tax debts (bodemvoorrecht). Failure to notify the Dutch tax authorities, or the exercise of its security
rights within the aforementioned waiting period in the manner contemplated in subclause (i) or (ii) above, may
result in the pledgee having to pay to the Dutch tax authorities an amount equal to the value of the relevant
assets or—in the case of an enforcement—the proceeds derived from the enforcement, provided that the amount
payable shall not exceed the amount of the relevant taxes due, regardless of whether such taxes have already
assessed or not. After the four-week waiting period has lapsed, or upon an earlier notification by the Dutch tax
authorities that they will not exercise their priority right, a pledgee may exercise its security rights. However,
the pledgee may only exercise such security rights during the four weeks following the lapse of the waiting
period, or the date of the notification from the Dutch tax authorities, as the case may be. After the four-week
period has ended, the aforementioned limitations are applicable again and the pledgee will only be able to
exercise its security rights with respect to such property, after a new notification to the Dutch tax authorities
and observance of a new waiting period.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy trustee to be verified.
“Verification” under Dutch law means that the bankruptcy trustee determines the value of the claim and whether
and to what extent the claim will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings for the purpose of the distribution
of the proceeds. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and
payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that are due and payable by their
terms within one year of the date of the bankruptcy of an Issuer or security grantor will be accelerated and
become due and payable as of that date. The valuation of claims that would not have been payable within one
year from the date of the bankruptcy may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall
due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted
by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Contractual subordination may to
a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way
such subordination is construed. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatie vergadering), the bankruptcy
trustee, the insolvent debtor and all provisionally verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of
other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred
to separate court proceedings (renvooi procedure). Such separate court procedures could also cause payments
to the holders of the Notes to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims.


-----

If it is likely that there will be insufficient assets in the bankruptcy estate to distribute to the unsecured
creditors, the bankruptcy judge may decide, at the request of the bankruptcy trustee, that it will not be necessary
to deal with the unsecured claims and that there will not be a meeting at which claims are admitted or rejected.
If the bankruptcy estate is sufficient to make a distribution to unsecured non-preferential creditors, remaining
amounts after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the positively
verified unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis.

Pursuant to article 138 Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) a composition may be offered to
creditors, which shall in general be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a
simple majority of the unsecured non-preferential creditors present or represented at the meeting, with admitted
and provisionally admitted claims representing at least 50% of the total amount of the admitted and
provisionally admitted unsecured non preferential claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the
court. Under certain conditions, the supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) may derogate from this procedure.
The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors in liquidation
compositions. Foreign creditors are, in general, not treated differently from creditors that are incorporated or
residing in The Netherlands.

As mentioned above, secured creditors which have a right in rem (goederenrechtelijke rechten) may
enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no
bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings, the court may order a “cooling-off period”
(afkoelingsperiode) on the basis of article 63a Dutch Bankruptcy Act for a maximum of two months during
(and potentially an additional two months) which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless
such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, the bankruptcy
trustee may force a secured creditor to realize its security right by giving the creditor notice to do so within a
reasonable time. A failure to take recourse by the creditor will result in the creditor forfeiting its rights to enforce
its security rights, albeit that its claim shall continue to be preferred. However, in such an event the creditor
must contribute to costs of the bankruptcy which may be considerable. Any excess proceeds of enforcement
and for which there is no valid security right must be returned to the bankruptcy estate and may not be off set
to any unsecured claims against the debtor. Lastly, the bankruptcy trustee may force the secured creditor to
hand the proceeds of certain pledged assets (bodemzaken) over to the bankruptcy trustee for the benefit of the
Dutch tax authorities pursuant to Article 57 (3) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act.

Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without
limitation, the provision of security or an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the
obligations of a third party and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency
proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its bankruptcy trustee. This can occur if
(i) the insolvent debtor performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) generally the
creditor concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the act,
and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the insolvent debtor and (unless the act was for no consideration
(om niet)) the party with whom or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its
creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. For the bankruptcy trustee, knowledge of prejudice is
presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a “suspect period” of one year prior to an
adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being
in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of
existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty
when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are
part of the same group of companies.

In addition, in case of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may nullify the debtor’s performance of any
due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a
third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been
filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between
the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors.

_The Dutch Scheme_

With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet
_homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“WHOA”) on 1 January 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a_
composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in
bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as
shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company
obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso
facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against
an Issuer being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently
confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that
are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside The Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA
can affect the rights of the noteholders.

Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two
thirds of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the
share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for
a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court
will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be
expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a
statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of
(i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is
lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of
a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the
statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground
to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the
composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these
creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of
such plan on the request of such creditor.

Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a
possible extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the
assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to
enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the
collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are
suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring
expert. The WHOA could therefore have an adverse effect on the ability of noteholders to recover payments
due on the notes.

_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests_

Pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a security document may be withheld under the doctrines of
reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and
unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden) and other defenses afforded by Dutch law to obligors
generally. Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be avoided because
it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging)
or error (dwaling). Furthermore, under Dutch law, a party to an agreement may under certain circumstances
suspend performance of its obligations under such agreement pursuant to the exceptio non-adimpleti contractus
or otherwise. Other impeding factors include a dissolution of a contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening).
The enforceability of the obligations of an Issuer may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet
_1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a_
Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and
collection costs.

Pursuant to Dutch law it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other
than the creditor of the claim purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the security
documents pursuant to which a security interest will be granted in the assets of a Dutch company could use a


-----

parallel debt structure, whereby the Dutch company, as separate and independent obligations, undertakes to pay
to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby amounts equal to the amounts due
by it to the other creditors. Such parallel debt structure therefore creates a separate and independent claim of
the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby which can be secured by a security
interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the
Notes offered hereby in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt, and
not as a representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the creditors. It is expressly agreed in such a parallel debt
provision that the obligations of the debtor to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered
hereby shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors are reduced
(and vice versa). However, such a parallel debt structure has never been tested before a Dutch court and we
cannot assure that it will mitigate or eliminate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch law.

A Dutch security interest can only serve as security for monetary claims (geldvorderingen) and be
enforced upon default (verzuim) of the obligations secured thereby. Foreclosure on pledged property must be
carried out in accordance with applicable provisions and limitations in The Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk
_Wetboek) and The Netherlands Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering)._

Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by a Dutch company under a security interest may be
adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity,
binding effect and enforceability of such security interest. The validity and enforceability of a security interest
granted by or in, a Dutch company may also be successfully contested by that Dutch company (or their
bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim.

The validity and enforceability of the obligations of a Dutch company under a security interest may
also be successfully contested by any creditor, or by the company’s respective bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy
when the company is in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the interests of any other
creditor and the other requirements for voidable preference under The Netherlands Civil Code and Netherlands
Bankruptcy Act are met. As a result, the value of the security interests provided by the Issuers may be limited.

Pursuant to Article 2:7 of The Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), any transaction entered
into by a legal entity may be nullified by the legal entity itself or its bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy if the
objects of that entity were transgressed by the transaction and the other party to the transaction knew or should
have known this without independent investigation (wist of zonder eigen onderzoek moest weten). The Dutch
Supreme Court (Hoge Raad der Nederlanden) has ruled that in determining whether the objects of a legal entity
are transgressed, not only the description of the objects in that legal entity’s articles of association (statuten) is
decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into account, in particular whether the transaction is in
the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit; and whether the subsistence
of the company is jeopardized by the transaction.

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of
bankruptcy. Pursuant to the actio pauliana provisions, legal acts performed by a natural or legal debtor can be
challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant debtor and may be nullified by the liquidator in bankruptcy
or by any creditor of that debtor outside bankruptcy, if: (i) such debtor performed such acts without an obligation
to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the concerned creditor or, in the case of bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in
its means of recovery as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the relevant
debtor and the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the debtor’s creditors (existing or
future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. This is different if the act was entered into for no
consideration (om niet), in which case such knowledge by the counterparty is not necessary for a successful
challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance.

The liability of the Issuers under the relevant security documents, will be limited to the amount that
will result in such security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate
distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will
apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of the Issuers. There is a possibility that the entire
security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.


-----

If a court were to find that the guaranteeing of the Notes, or the granting of the security, was a
fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the
payment obligations under such security documents are ineffective, could void the security over the collateral,
or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or any
enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent
preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Issuer and would
be a creditor solely of a Guarantor, any other guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Notes
Guarantee or Security Documents that have not been declared void.

The general terms and conditions of Dutch banks applicable to bank accounts held in The Netherlands
often provide for a restriction on the creation of security over bank account receivables in favor of third parties.
As a result, it may not be possible to create security over bank accounts held in The Netherlands unless prior
consent has been obtained from the relevant account bank. Without such consent there may be no valid security
over the Dutch bank accounts. In addition, also if the consent has been granted and a valid security right has
been created, such security is subject to a right of pledge and right of set-off of the account bank based on the
General Banking Conditions (Algemene Bankvoorwaarden), unless such rights of pledge and set-off have been
waived by the relevant account bank.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuers, the Target and its subsidiaries are companies organized under the laws of The Netherlands.
All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers, the Target and the Group are non-residents of the
United States and all of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a consequence, you
may not be able to effect service of process on these non-U.S. resident directors and officers in the United States
or to enforce judgments against them outside of the United States, including judgments of the U.S. courts
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or our directors you will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where we or the relevant director has assets. As a result, it could be difficult or
impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals outside of the United States in the
event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the applicable securities laws or otherwise.
Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws outside of the United States could render
you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors. While the enforceability of
U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for The Netherlands, you should consult with
your own advisors as needed to enforce a judgment in The Netherlands or elsewhere outside the United States.

There is currently no treaty between the United States and The Netherlands for the mutual recognition
and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a
final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be automatically
be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court
of competent jurisdiction. Under current practice, however, a Dutch court will generally, subject to compliance
with certain procedural requirements, recognize and give effect to the judgment if such judgment (i) is a final
judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction on the basis of internationally
accepted grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) has not been rendered in violation of principles of proper procedure
(behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) is not contrary to the public policy of The Netherlands, and (iv) is not
incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b)
a prior judgment of a foreign court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject
matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is capable of being recognized
in The Netherlands. Dutch courts may deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or other
awards. If a Dutch court upholds and regards as conclusive evidence the final judgment of the U.S. court, the
Dutch court will generally grant the same judgment without litigating again on the merits.

Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement and
recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in The Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of the Dutch
Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Based on the foregoing, there can be no
assurance that U.S. investors will be able to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and
commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities.

Dutch civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar
as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on
common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial
compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. Such pre-trial discovery process
does not exist under Dutch law. In the event directors or other third parties are liable towards a Dutch company,
only the company itself can bring a civil action against those parties. The individual shareholders do not have
the right to bring an action on behalf of the company. Only in the event that the cause for the liability of a third
party to the company also constitutes a tortious act directly against a shareholder, such shareholder has an
individual right of action against such third party in its own name. The Dutch Civil Code does provide for the
possibility to initiate such actions collectively and a foundation or an association whose objective is to protect
the rights of a group of persons having similar interests can institute a collective action. The collective action
itself does not result in an order for payment of monetary damages but may only result in a declaratory judgment.

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

**GENERAL**

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the interim reporting period ended
30 September 2021 have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting as included in International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by
the European Union (“EU-IFRS”).

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using the same
accounting policies as used in the 2020 Annual Report dated 6 December 2021. Therefore, these
condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include a full set off accounting policies nor
a full set of notes that are normally included in the Annual Report. Accordingly, this report is to be read
in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2020.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have not been audited by the Company’s
external auditor.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in thousands of euros and give
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group.
The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis unless otherwise stated.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the
Company’s board of management on 6 December 2021.

**CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE ENTITY**

On 6 September 2021, funds advised by Warburg Pincus LLC (“Warburg Pincus”) and funds advised
by Apax Partners LLP (“Apax”), have agreed to acquire T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V from
Deutsche Telekom AG and Tele2 AB. The transaction values the company at an Enterprise Value of
EUR 5.1bn. The deal is subject to approval from regulatory bodies and finalization of the consultation
process with the Works Council.

On 6 September 2021, DT Europe B.V., Tele2 Sverige AB and T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V.
have signed a settlement agreement to terminate the rights and obligations for each of the parties
under the SPA concluded in February 2018. This includes, but is not limited to, indemnities for certain
claims that existed on the signing date. Some of the indemnities will be continued under the SPA
concluded on 6 September 2021 with the contemplated new owners of T-Mobile Netherlands Holdings
B.V.

**GOING CONCERN**

The management of the Group has assessed the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and is
satisfied that the Group has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, the Group is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubts
upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, these condensed consolidated
interim financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. As at the date of these
condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the company has a robust liquidity and revolving
credit facility headroom of EUR 100 million at Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V., and anticipates having
sufficient liquidity to fulfill and finance its ongoing operations for the foreseeable future. Management is
confident that the expected change in shareholder composition will not impact the availability of
financing and liquidity for the Group.

**CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES**

The Group did not make changes in its accounting policies during the interim period and the same
accounting policies and methods of computation are followed as compared to the most recent annual
financial statements.

**STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP**

The accounting policies applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the
same as those applied in the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2020. IFRS standards, interpretations and amendments effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2021, do not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated
interim financial statements of the Group for the period ended 30 September 2021. The Group has not
early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet
effective (even if earlier application is permissible).

**USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES**

In preparing these interim financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates that
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income
and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the
key sources of estimation uncertainty are the same as those described in the last annual consolidated
financial statements.

The increase in net revenues is mainly the result of a higher customer base and therefore higher
mobile service revenues. In December 2020 the Group acquired Simpel B.V. Also higher out-of-bundle
revenues supported by higher visitor revenues are attributable to the increase in revenues. The good
and services purchased increased due to higher marketing and merchandise expenses.

**3** **TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES**

Gross trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 524,540 585,721

**466,778** **520,843**

The trade and other receivables decreased compared to 31 December 2020 mainly due to a decrease
in handset loans, a release due to a settlement reached in September 2021 with the opposing party
(refer also to note 10 Provisions) and increased factoring of trade receivables following cash
management procedures. The credit loss allowance remained in line with the previous period.

**4** **INVENTORIES**

Inventories comprise of finished products and goods for resale. The inventory position decreased
during the year from EUR 41.8 million to EUR 25.6 million. The balance at 31 December 2020 was
exceptionally high due to the strict lockdown announced by the government in December 2020 where
we had to close our shops and to send our stock via other distribution channels in the last two weeks of
December, resulting into an higher inventory balance per year-end.

Depending on the nature of the specific project, assets under construction (AUC) are either presented
under intangible assets or property, plant and equipment. Assets under construction in the tables
above mainly represent costs incurred in the construction and modernization of the Group’s mobile and
fixed line telecommunications network.

When projects included in AUC (both under intangible assets or property, plant and equipment) are
completed, the capitalized amount is allocated to the respective asset class which can result into a
transfer within the same asset class, from intangible fixed assets to property, plant and equipment or
the opposite way.

The additions primarily relate to investments in telecommunication equipment for the modernization of
the Group’s network.

The Company continuously monitors the usage and physical presence of its items of property, plant
and equipment. In case an item is no longer used or disposed of, it is derecognized and presented as a
disposal. In 2021, the Company commenced an asset clean-up project due to the phasing out of the
2G network and to the dismantling of Tele2 sites resulting in derecognition of items of property, plant
and equipment. Practically all of the disposed assets were already fully depreciated. The acquisition
value of the scrapped assets amounts to EUR 1,065.3 million, the accumulated depreciation of these
disposed assets amounts to EUR 1,064.9 million. Items disposed of include amongst others cost
incurred for the dismantling of the Tele2 sites, the construction of sites and base transceiver stations.

The Group entered into a number of new leases during the period. Contract changes are the result of
contract modifications and indexation of existing leases. The depreciation amounts to EUR 69.2 million
which is the result of depreciation of recognized leases.

The decrease in the intangible assets is mainly the result of amortization of intangible assets.

The Company continuously monitors the usage of its intangible assets. In case an item is no longer
used, it is derecognized and presented as a disposal. In 2021, the Company commenced an asset
clean-up project due to the phasing out of the 2G network and the dismantling of Tele2 sites, resulting
in derecognition of items of intangible assets. The disposed assets were already fully amortized. The
acquisition value of the scrapped assets amounts to EUR 65.8 million, the accumulated amortization of
these disposed assets amounts to EUR 65.8 million. Items disposed of include amongst others
software related to 3G licenses.

**370,053** **584,202**

Amounts due to Group companies decreased significantly due to the fact that balances against Cignal
Infrastructure Netherlands B.V. (formally known as T-Mobile Infra B.V. and hereafter “T-Infra”) were
shown as amounts due to Group companies in 2020, whereas in 2021 T-Infra is treated as associated
company, i.e. disclosed as amounts payable to related parties. The amounts due to Group companies
bear no interest. Nothing has been agreed in respect of repayment and securities. The accruals
amounting to EUR 53.3 million consist of the provision for share-based payments and the increase solely
results from the regular addition to this provision. The significant decrease in the other amounts payable
is caused by the payment of the 5G spectrum license (EUR 200 million) to the Dutch Government.

**9** **FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND LEASE LIABILITIES**

**FINANCIAL LIABILITIES**

On 27 December 2018 a EUR 1.2 billion Facilities Agreement was signed with Deutsche Telekom
Europe B.V. and GTS Central European Holding B.V. by T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. and
T-Mobile Netherlands B.V. This Facilities Agreement was amended retroactively early 2019 adding an
additional loan from Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V. to T-Mobile Netherlands Holding BV of EUR
25 million per 27 December 2018. Of the total EUR 1.225 billion Facilities Agreement an amount of
EUR 100 million is a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). The loans and the RCF, when used, bear an
annual interest rate of 4.25%, the RCF, when not used, bears an annual commitment fee of 1.25%. For
the loans quarterly repayments of EUR 10.25 million have been agreed, starting from 31 March 2020
onwards. The maturity date for the loans is 31 December 2023.

On 27 November 2020 a EUR 270 million Facility Agreement was signed by T-Mobile Netherlands BV
with Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V.. This loan has an annual interest rate 1.64% and quarterly
repayments amounting to EUR 13.5 million have been agreed starting 31 March 2022. The maturity
date of this loan is 30 November 2026.

The fair value of the interest-bearing loans approximates the carrying value. The Group has to meet
the requirements of the shareholder loan covenants; the interest coverage ratio and the leverage ratio.
The interest coverage ratio should be 1.00:1, which is the ratio of EBIT in respect to the interest
payments. The interest coverage ratio is 3.7 as per 30 September 2021 (31 December 2020: 3.8). The
leverage ratio is the ratio of the Net Debt on the last day of the reporting period to EBITDA adjusted in
respect to the relevant reporting period and may not exceed 4.00:1. The leverage ratio is 3.1 as per
30 September 2021 (31 December 2020: 3.1). The Group complies with the financial covenants per
30 September 2021.

**Balance at 30 September 2021 . . . . . . .** **32,809** **7,203** **40,012**

**ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO)**

Assets are retired based on several factors, including the availability of new technology, which cannot
be accurately forecasted for the long-term. This uncertainty may impact the timing of the utilization of
the provisions. The total obligation is recognized at net present value at the moment the underlying
assets are put into operation. The provision is calculated based upon a discount rate range of
0.00% - 1.27% (2020: 0.00% - 1.95%) and an inflation rate of 1.20% (2020: 1.60%). As of
30 September 2021, the current portion of ARO provision amounts to EUR 5.2 million (31 December
2020: 6.4 million). The decrease in the ARO provision is due to utilization of the provision in the
reporting period.

**OTHER PROVISIONS**

The other provisions include provisions related to claims and provisions for pension contributions. The
decrease in other provisions compared to 31 December 2020 is primary due to a release following a
settlement reached in September 2021 with the opposing party. The current portion of the provision
(due in less than 1 year) amounts to EUR 1.1 million (31 December 2020: 1.1 million).

**11** **INCOME TAXES**

For the nine months ended 30 September 2021, the effective tax rate was 25.1% (2020: 15.8%). The
effective tax rate for the nine-month period of 2021 was 0.1% higher than the statutory tax rate of
25.0% due to non-deductible expenses. The lower effective tax rate for the nine-month period of 2020
is due to the carry back of tax losses and several tax differences with an overall positive tax effect.

The temporary differences by underlying items and unutilized tax losses deferred tax asset as of

The carryforward tax losses are recognized in full because it is expected that these can be completely
utilized with future taxable profits.

**12** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020 describe the
financial risks that the Group is exposed to in the normal course of business, as well as the policies
and processes that are in place for managing these risks.

Those risks remain valid and should be read in conjunction with these interim financial statements.

**CREDIT RISK**

As at 30 September 2021, the gross amount of the trade receivables is EUR 524.5 million
(31 December 2020: EUR 585.7 million). Credit loss allowances of EUR 93.0 million (31 December
2020: EUR 95.5 million) are recognized based on probability weighting of multiple scenarios including
forward looking information.

The movement of the credit loss allowance is as follows:

**Allowances of financial assets measured at amortized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income or**
**continuing involvement**

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk from fair value at profit or loss at 30 September 2021
and 31 December 2020 is equal to the carrying amounts.

**INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT**

The Group has two fixed interest group loan facilities. These loans are carried at amortized cost and
are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined in IFRS 7. As per 30 September 2021 the fixed
interest rate is 4.25% for the loan granted in 2018 and 1.64% for the loan drawn in December 2020.
Future refinancing might lead to a different interest rate. For one factoring agreement the Group is
exposed to variable interest rates of 1month Euribor plus a fixed margin of 95bps. For the other two
agreements the Group is exposed to variable interest rates of 1month Euribor plus a fixed margin of
65. Given the current negative Euribor interest rates and the expected developments in the market
interest, the Group does not have measures in place as the risk is considered to be low.

**LIQUIDITY RISK**

The Group manages its liquidity risks by using Deutsche Telekom AG companies to secure financing.
If necessary, further funding is provided by the Group’s finance companies. As per 30 September 2021
two long-term loans, which mature on December 2023 respectively November 2026, are shown in the
statement of financial position. For further details see Note 6 Financial liabilities.

**CAPITAL MANAGEMENT**

Net debt to equity ratio per 30 September 2021 is as follows:

**Net debt to equity ratio . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **113%** **121%**

The net debt decreased by an amount of EUR 49.6 million to EUR 1,947.8 million. As of 30 September
2021, the total lease liability amounts to EUR 760.7 million, mainly resulting from the lease
commitments with T-Infra and other recognized leases. The decrease in the lease liabilities is mainly
the result of principal repayments of leases.

**FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE**

During the nine-month ended 30 September 2021, there have been no material changes with regard to
the fair value hierarchy.

For the trade receivables, assigned to Level 3, which are measured either at fair value through profit
and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income, the main factor in determining fair value is
the credit risk of the relevant counterparties. If the default rates apply as of the reporting date had been
1% higher (lower) with no change in the reference variables, the fair values of the instruments would
have been 1% lower (higher). Following the prudence concept, recoveries of defaulted receivables are
not taken into account. Allowances on trade receivables that are classified as debt instruments
measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive
income are reported under other operating expenses.

**FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**30 September 2021** **31 December 2020**
**Fair Value** **Book Value** **Fair Value** **Book Value**
EUR’1000 EUR’1000 EUR’1000 EUR’1000
**Liabilities**
Liabilities to banks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,090 9,090 6,974 6,974

The fair value of the financial instruments accounted for at amortized costs approximates their carrying
value as the interest rate risks is considered to be minimal given the low interest rate in the European
Union and limited changes in the interest rates, e.g. for financial instruments such as short-term trade
receivables and payables For these instruments no fair value is disclosed.

-----

Liabilities to banks are mostly short-term nature, respectively have a variable interest rate. Therefore,
the fair value of liabilities to banks approximates the book value. The interest rate as the main input
factor for the fair value is observable at the market and therefore level 2 of the fair value hierarchy
applies.

The fair value of the amounts due to group companies mainly consists of the loan from DT Europe B.V.
and GTS Central Europe Holding B.V. amounting to a book value of EUR 1,323.3 million
(31 December 2020: EUR 1,354.0 million). The fair value of these loans per 30 September 2021 is
EUR 1,441.7 million (31 December 2020: EUR 1,509.6 million) and is calculated as the present values
of the payments associated with the debt, based on the applicable yield curve and credit spread curve.
The remaining amount represents current accounts payable to group companies of which the fair value
equals the book value.

**13** **COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**

**CONTINGENT LIABILITIES**

The Group is involved in various disputes or claims arising in the normal course of business. In the
opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome of the disputes will not have a material effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Group. Management intends to defend the claims
vigorously.

T-Mobile has reached a settlement agreement with certain claim organizations related to all-in telecom
contracts, whereby the price of the mobile phone was not presented separately in the telecom contract.
There are some claim organizations which T-Mobile has not yet reached a settlement agreement with
and it is also not certain that such settlement will be included. For these organizations, T-Mobile has
not yet received all the necessary information to process the related claims. Consequently, T-Mobile is
not able to make a reliable estimate of the possible compensations nor of any reimbursements.

Due to current developments in the copper market, T-Mobile is aware of the fact that additional
expenses will be incurred in the future to adequately continue our services to our clients. However, as
deliberations with external parties are still ongoing, T-Mobile is currently not able to make a reliable
estimate of the possible unavoidable expenses related to the developments in the copper market.

**BANK GUARANTEES**

The Group or its subsidiaries have issued bank guarantees in the amount of EUR 3.0 million
(31 December 2020: EUR 3.6 million).

**OTHER COMMITMENTS**

At 30 September 2021, the Group entered into various contracts for the acquisition of items of
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and commitments for a long term
partnership with Primevest for fiber, resulting in commitments of EUR 206,8 million (31 December
2020: EUR 219.9 million).

the Netherlands. During the nine-month period ended 30 September three new clusters were
delivered. The Group has recognized lease liabilities for usage of the network during the exclusivity
period and has an off balance sheet commitment for the delivered clusters and signed (sub) cluster
agreements for the years thereafter amounting to EUR 24.2 million.

**15** **SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

On 1 April 2021, the Group signed a long-term agreement to become an anchor tenant on the fiber
network to be rolled out by Open Dutch Fiber (ODF), a newly established company owner by
investment funds KKR and DTCP (hereafter ‘MSA’). ODF will install fiber optic internet to one million
Dutch households over the next five years. As per this agreement, the Group commits to a long-term
agreement to utilize the fiber Infrastructure and warrant a minimum set of payments of 20% for eight
years to the lessor. The MSA only provides a framework / general terms for the Cluster Agreements
(CA) that T-Mobile will conclude with the lessor. The CAs set out the details per cluster (area) such as
object, commencement date, cluster specifics, charges and payments.

Pursuant to the provisions of the MSA/CA, the initial lease term begins on the date on which the
relevant cluster is ready for service. Hence, the Group commits to lease the fiber Infrastructure within a
cluster and commit to a minimum usage to the lessor as per the date that the sub-cluster agreement is
signed. As per the date when the interim financial statements are authorized for issue twelve
sub-cluster agreements were signed.

The customer base was measured using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method,
the fair value of the customer base is calculated by determining the present value of earnings after tax
attributable to existing customers. The customer base is amortized over the remaining useful life of
around 8 years. The brand was measured using relief from royalty method. Under this method, the

F-30


-----

value of the brand is calculated by making an assumption about which license costs would be
notionally payable if the company did not own the relevant asset. The brand is amortized over the
remaining useful life of 10 years.

The carrying amounts of the acquired receivables are based on the fair values. The gross amounts of
the trade and other receivables amount to EUR 6 million. No material contingent liabilities have been
identified. The deferred tax liabilities comprise the tax effect on the temporary differences between the
fair value of the different assets and liabilities on the one hand, and the respective carrying amount for
tax purposes on the other.

The acquired goodwill is calculated as follows:

**2020**
Fair value at the
acquisition date

EUR’1000
Consideration transferred . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 292,720

**Gross goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **196,373**

The goodwill reflects the value of new customer additions anticipated in connection with the acquisition
and is not deductible for tax purposes. Transaction-related costs totaling EUR 2 million were incurred
in the Group in the 2020 financial year. These mainly comprised legal and consulting fees and are
included under other operating expenses.

T-Mobile’s net revenue and result increased by respectively EUR 4.6 million and 1.5 million in the
reporting period due to the acquisition. If the business combination had taken place at the beginning of
the 2020 financial year, net revenue and profit would have been respectively EUR 119 million and EUR
9 million higher than reported. The revenue and profit or loss of the combined entity for the current
reporting period as though the acquisition date for the business combination that occurred during the
year has been as of the beginning of the reporting period.

**2.5** **CONSOLIDATION METHODS**

**2.5.1 SUBSIDIARIES**

Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control only exists if
an investor has the power over the investee, is exposed to variable returns, and is able to use power to
affect its amount of variable returns. The existence and effect of substantive potential voting rights that
are currently exercisable or convertible, including potential voting rights held by other Group
companies, are considered when assessing whether an entity is controlled.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies
are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

All subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. Income and expenses of a
subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. Income and
expenses of a subsidiary remain included in the consolidated financial statements until the date on
which the parent ceases to control the subsidiary.

F-34


-----

Upon loss of control, a gain or loss from the disposal of the subsidiary is recognized in the consolidated
income statement in the amount of the difference between the (I) proceeds from the disposal of the
subsidiary, the fair value of the remaining shares, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests,
and the cumulative amounts of other comprehensive income attributable to the subsidiary, and (II) the
carrying amount of the subsidiary’s net assets to be disposed of.

**2.6** **BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

A business combination exists when the Group obtains control of another entity. The acquisition
method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity
instruments or other assets are acquired. The cost of an acquired business is measured at the fair
value of the consideration transferred, comprising the:

   - the fair values of the assets transferred

   - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business

   - equity interest issued by the Group

   - fair value of any asset and liability resulting from contingent consideration arrangement, and

   - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary

The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized in
full at their fair values at the acquisition date, regardless of the level of the investment held by the
Group. The Group recognized any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate
share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill arising in a business combination is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the cost of
acquisition, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and in a business combination
achieved in stages, the fair value of the equity interest held by the Group in the acquiree prior to the
acquisition date over the fair value of the net assets acquired. If those amounts are less than the fair
value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognized directly in
profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. Any difference arising on the revaluation of equity interests
previously held by the Group is recognized in profit or loss.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are
discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s
incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an
independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a
financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
profit or loss.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any
gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.

**_Common control acquisitions_**

A business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business
combination in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same
party or parties both before and after the business combination, and that control is not transitory. A
transaction deemed to be a transaction under common control consequently falls outside the scope of
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. The Group’s accounting policy is to apply predecessor accounting to
common control transactions.

F-35


-----

**2.7** **FOREIGN CURRENCIES**

**2.7.1 FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY**

The consolidated financial statements are denominated in euros, which is the functional and reporting
currency of the Group. Items included in the financial statements of group companies are measured
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective group company
operates (the functional currency).

**2.7.2 TRANSACTIONS, RECEIVABLES AND DEBTS**

Foreign-currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the
date of transaction. At the reporting date, monetary items are translated at the closing rate, and
non-monetary items are translated at the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Exchange rate
differences are recognized in profit or loss.

**2.8** **GOING CONCERN**

The management of the Group has assessed the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and is
satisfied that the Group has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, the Group is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubts
upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial
statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. As at the date of these financial
statements, the company has a robust liquidity and revolving credit facility headroom of EUR
100 million at Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V., and anticipates having sufficient liquidity to fulfill and
finance its ongoing operations for the foreseeable future.

**2.9** **THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OUR BUSINESS**

The COVID-19 outbreak has developed rapidly in many countries in the world including the
Netherlands. The measures taken to contain the virus have affected the economic activities globally.
However, the consequences of the COVID-19 outspread and measures taken by the government have
not materially affected the supply and demand for the Company’s primary services. Therefore, its
operating results and cash flows from operations have not been negatively impacted subsequently,
and the company has sufficient liquidity. T-Mobile has taken several measures to limit the spread of
COVID-19 within the company. Retail shops were closed as from 16 March 2020 and reopened shortly
thereafter, taking into account necessary safety measures for our employees and customers. As of
15 December 2020, government has issued new measures to cope with COVID-19. Based on the new
measures T-Mobile was forced to close its shops. As per Q1 2021 customers are allowed to visit
T-shops on an appointment basis and since 28 April 2021 we are allowed to welcome our customers in
our shops without an appointment. We have implemented a working from home policy and enabled our
employees to work from home in the best possible way. Our networks are stable and can currently
cope well with the additional volume caused by increased numbers of people working from home.

Based on the facts and circumstances known at this moment and the possible scenarios about how the
COVID-19 virus and resulting government measures could evolve, management has determined that,
whilst uncertain, we do not believe, however, that the impact of the COVID-19 virus would have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.

**2.10** **SEGMENT REPORTING**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided, in
accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Segment Reporting’ to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) which is
the Executive Committee of the Group. The Group identified three operating segments: Consumer,
Business and Other.

The Consumer segment offers fixed and mobile services (including handset sales) to the consumer.
The Business segment offers fixed and mobile services for entrepreneurs and enterprises. The
segment Other consists of costs related to the Group’s headquarters and other revenues such as
wholesale revenue.

F-36


-----

**2.11** **JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES**

The presentation of the results of operations or financial position in the consolidated financial
statements is dependent upon and sensitive to assumptions, and estimates. The actual amounts may
differ from those estimates. The following critical accounting estimates and related assumptions and
uncertainties inherent in accounting policies applied are essential to understand the underlying
financial reporting risks and the effects that these accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties
may have on the consolidated financial statements.

**2.11.1 IMPAIRMENTS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets involves the
use of estimates applied in the future cash flows that are reflected in the forecast. The forecast is
based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of
growth in the telecommunications industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability
of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services, current replacement costs, prices
paid in comparable transactions, and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment
exists.

The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows and the
determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant
judgements concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows,
applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values. Specifically, the estimation of cash flows
underlying the fair values from the mobile business considers the continued investment in network
infrastructure required to generate future revenue growth through the offering of new data products and
services, for which only limited historical information on customer demand is available. If the demand
for these products and services does not materialize as expected, this would result in less revenue,
less cash flow, and potential impairment. When determining the fair values, additional planning
uncertainties are factored in that reflect the risks of macroeconomic development, which could
adversely affect future results of operations.

**2.11.2 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS**

Depreciation and amortization expenses are based on management estimates of useful life, residual
value and amortization method of property and equipment and intangible assets. Estimates may
change due to technological developments, competition, changes in market conditions and other
factors and may result in changes in the estimated useful life and in the amortization or depreciation
charges.

Technological developments are difficult to predict and our views on the trends and pace of
development may change over time. Some of the assets and technologies, in which the Group
invested several years ago, are still in use and provide the basis for new technologies. The useful lives
of property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed at least annually, taking into
consideration the factors mentioned above and all other relevant factors.

**2.11.3 DETERMINATION OF THE CASH GENERATING UNITS AND THE RECOVERABLE**
**AMOUNT OF A CASH-GENERATING UNIT**

The determination of cash-generating units for the Group applies management judgement.
Management determined three cash-generating units: Consumer, Business and Other.

The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates
by management. Methods used to calculate the recoverable amount include discounted cash flowbased methods and methods that use market prices as a basis. The measurements based on
discounted cash flows are founded on projections that are based on financial plans that have been
approved by management and are also used for internal purposes. The planning horizon selected
reflects the assumptions for short- to medium-term market developments and is selected to achieve a
steady state in the business outlook that is necessary for calculating the perpetual annuity.

F-37


-----

This steady state is only reached based on the planning horizon selected, in particular due to the
sometimes long investment cycles in the telecommunications industry and the investments planned
and expected in the long run to acquire and extend the rights of spectrum use. Cash flows beyond the
internal mid-term planning are extrapolated using appropriate growth rates.

The key assumptions on which management has based its calculation of the recoverable amount
include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on
past experience as well as internal expectations, and that are underscored by external market data and
estimates: development of revenue, customer acquisition and retention costs, churn rates, capital
expenditure, market share, and growth rates. Discount rates are determined based on external figures
derived from the market, taking account of the risks associated with the cash-generating unit. Any
future changes in the aforementioned assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair values of
the cash-generating units.

**2.11.4 IMPAIRMENT OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT ASSETS**

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. To measure the
expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared
credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress
and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of
contracts. The group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a
reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.

In determining lifetime expected credit losses:

   - receivables are grouped based on historical credit loss experience;

   - different loss rates are determined for the different ageing buckets of trade receivables.

   - historical credit loss experience is adjusted to incorporate relevant forward-looking
information. (which is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date).

If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, actual write-offs might be higher than
expected.

**2.11.5 BUSINESS COMBINATION**

The purchase consideration for the business of Simpel was calculated based on the business plan
provided by the Group’s management. The determination of the business plan for the enlarged
company involved the use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing, and
amount of future cash flows. It is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current
competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, increased cost of
capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological developments, services, prices paid
in comparable transactions. The estimation of future cash flows require management to make
significant judgements. Specifically, the estimation of cash flows underlying the synergies demand
assumptions that reflect market participant perspectives. If those assumptions do not materialize as
expected, this would result in deviating cash flows.

**2.11.6 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS**

In order to determine the fair value of the Stock Appreciation Rights (‘SAR’) scheme per balance sheet
date, management had to make assumptions regarding the valuation of the equity of the Group and
the number of SARs to be vested under the arrangement. The valuation method that has been applied
for the determination of the equity value is a combination of three valuation methods: the Discounted
Cash Flow (“DCF”) method, the Market Method (‘MM’) and the Transactions Method (‘TM’) . The
financial forecast is the most important input. It includes assumptions about development of revenue,
customer acquisition and retention costs, churn rates, capital expenditure, market share, and growth
rates. Furthermore, assumptions had to be made about certain vesting scenarios under the
arrangement and the numbers of SAR vesting, which particularly depend on the estimated number of
participants under the vesting scenarios.

F-38


-----

**2.12** **JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that the Group has
made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant
effect on the amounts recognized in financial statements:

**2.12.1 JUDGEMENT IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS**

The Group exercises considerable judgement in the classification of their in-house cash pool balances
as cash equivalents. These in-house cash pool balances are managed within the Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTAG) Group treasury function. The DTAG Group treasury function operates as an in-house bank
which has similar characteristics as a regular bank. It maintains sufficient cash and liquid resources,
along with access to credit lines, to meet all intercompany obligations simultaneously. With respect to
DTAG’s liquidity risk, DTAG has met its targets for the liquidity reserve to cover at least the maturities
for the next 24 months in both 2020 and 2019. Deutsche Telekom had standardized bilateral credit
agreements with 21 banks for a total of EUR 12.6 billion as of 31 December 2020. None of these lines
have been utilized as of 31 December 2020. In the prior year, a transaction of EUR 0.6 billion was
temporarily deducted from a credit line. The internal control processes and procedures from the DTAG
central treasury department are implemented and monitored according to the minimum requirements
set by the German Financial Market Authority, where applicable. The DTAG central treasury
department monitors the balances of all companies that are part of the central cash pooling and
ensures sufficient funding of the respective balances.

In addition, the company has direct access to these cash pool accounts and is entitled to terminate the
cash pooling agreement without notice for good reason.

Management has therefore assessed that these balances are highly liquid instruments that are also
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

**2.12.2 JUDGEMENTS FOR THE RECOVERABILITY OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES**

In the Dutch tax jurisdiction in which the Group operates, management must make judgements for the
calculation of current and deferred taxes. This is relevant, for example, when it comes to a decision on
the recognition of deferred tax assets because it must be probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which the deductible temporary differences, loss carryforwards, and tax credits can be utilized.

In addition to the estimate of future earnings, various factors are used to assess the probability of the
future utilization of deferred tax assets, including past results of operations, the reliability of planning,
and tax planning strategies. The period used for the assessment of the recoverability depends on the
circumstances at the respective Group company and typically is in a range of 5 to 10 years.

**2.12.3 JUDGEMENT IN MEASURING AND RECOGNIZING PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT**
**LIABILITIES**

The Group exercises considerable judgement in measuring and recognizing provisions and contingent
liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement,
mediation, arbitration, or government regulation. Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood
that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the final
settlement. Provisions are recognized for losses from executory contracts, provided a loss is
considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Because of the inherent uncertainties in this
evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. In addition,
significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to taxes and litigation risks.
These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the
support of internal specialists, if available, or with the support of outside consultants, such as actuaries
or legal counsel. Revisions to the estimates of these losses from executory contracts may significantly
affect future results of operations. For the Asset Retirement Obligation (‘ARO’) the Group used the
costs results from the past and expectation of the future costs and discounted these amounts. The
ARO provision for mobile network sites has a period lifetime equal to the lifetime of the most recently
acquired spectrum licenses.

F-39

**2.12.4 JUDGEMENT IN DISCLOSURE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES T-INFRA B.V.**

**Judgement in accounting for demerger of T- Infra B.V. and subsequent lease back of assets**

On 1 September 2018, T-Mobile demerged T-Infra B.V., consisting primarily of passive infrastructure
and site lease agreements, and subsequently transferred Infra B.V. as a dividend in kind to Deutsche
Telekom Europe B.V., the company’s parent company, on 1 January 2019. In 2018 after the demerger,
T-Mobile entered into a lease agreement with the newly founded Infra B.V. regarding the demerged
passive infrastructure and sites. The Group has concluded that the transfer of Infra B.V. is a transfer of
a business as it meets the definitions under IFRS. The business was transferred in the amount of EUR
130 million of net assets of which EUR 82 million related to allocated goodwill previously recognized on
the acquisition of a network. It also includes an amount of EUR 343 million for a right of use asset and
a lease liability for the same amount recognized under IFRS 16 for the site leases on 1 January 2019.
There are no changes in the current reporting figures in relation to the demerger of the T-Infra B.V.
business.

The Group has also concluded that the transfer of the business is a transaction under common control
and in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, such transfer and dividend in kind distribution
takes place at book values. The lease contract entered into is accounted for under IFRS 16. The right
of use asset recognized for the lease agreement between T-Infra and T-Mobile which includes lease
payments for the passive infrastructure and the site leases, but also for maintenance, amounted to
EUR 435 million as at 1 January 2019. This means that the passive equipment previously carried at
cost and the right of use assets related to the greenfield and rooftop spaces is transferred and
consequently leased back. As the lease is entered into at market terms the right of use asset for the
new lease is measured in line with these market terms.

Considering the substance of the transaction, the Group assessed whether the sale lease back
guidance of IFRS 16 should be applicable in this transaction and as such should the passive
infrastructure remain at its original book value and not be remeasured, leading to lower amortization in
the future. The Group has considered both applicability of the sale lease back guidance as well as the
alternative view that sale and lease back guidance is not applicable. It was concluded that while in
substance this may well represent a sale and lease back transaction, the original transfer of the Infra
business is a transaction under common control, for which IFRIC 17 is not applicable. Our policy is to
account for non-cash dividends within the Group and other common control transactions at book value.
Applying sale lease back guidance will result in a lower right of use asset and as such a lower amount
of depreciation in the future which is akin to recognizing a gain on the distribution of Infra to the parent
at a later date, which is contradicting the purpose of the common control transaction guidance. The
Group therefore concluded that the sale lease back guidance is not applicable, which is regarded a
management judgement in the Group’s accounting for this transaction.

Following the decision to distribute T-Infra B.V. to the shareholders of the Group, the T-Infra B.V.
assets and liabilities have been presented as held for distribution to owners in the financial statements
2018. In this respect management needed to make judgements regarding the allocation of goodwill
associated with the operation, anticipating where the goodwill will be recovered going forward. As per
1 January 2019, the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary were derecognized from the
consolidated statement of financial position.

**2.12.5** **JUDGEMENT:** **REVENUE** **RECOGNITION,** **CONTRACT** **ASSETS** **AND** **LIABILITIES/**
**CONTRACT COSTS**

One-time payments by the customer for contracts that can be terminated at any time are recognized
over an expected contract period, the length of which depends on the period over which the customer
is likely from a commercial perspective to renew or not terminate the contract on a monthly basis.

Gross versus net presentation: for assessment of gross or net presentation of revenues, the Group has
assessed its customer contracts and has determined that it acts as a principal in all its contracts with
customers. The Group has also assessed that revenues from handsets sold by indirect partners must
be presented net, since the indirect partners are the principals in selling the handsets. The revenues
from the other contract components from these indirect sales, e.g. service and connection fees are
presented gross, since the company is the principal for these products and services.

F-40


-----

The standalone selling prices of individual products or services that are part of multiple-element
arrangements are complex to determine, because some of the elements are price-sensitive and, thus,
volatile in a competitive marketplace. In many cases, standalone selling prices can also not be
observed for the company’s own products. Due to the fact that comparability is generally not
completely assured, the use of market prices for similar products is subject to an element of
uncertainty, as is an estimate using a cost-plus-margin approach. Changes in estimates of standalone
selling prices can significantly influence the allocation of the transaction price for the entire multipleelement arrangement among the individual performance obligations and therefore affect both the
financial position, i.e. the carrying amount of contract assets and contract liabilities, and the current and
future results of operations.

Contract costs are recognized as an expense and amortized on a systematic basis over the expected
duration of the customer relationship. The estimate of the expected average duration of customer
retention is based on historical customer turnover. However, this is subject to fluctuations and has only
limited informative value with regard to future customer behavior, particularly if new products are rolled
out. If management’s estimates are revised, material differences may result in the amount and timing
of expenses for subsequent periods.

The significance of material rights is an estimate that is based on both quantitative and qualitative factors.
This is ultimately a matter of judgement, even though it is supported by quantitative facts. Depending on
the decision as to whether or not the customer has a material right to be deferred, there may be material
differences in the amount and timing of revenues for the current and subsequent periods.

**2.12.6 JUDGEMENTS: EXTENSION AND TERMINATION OPTIONS FOR THE LESSEE**

In determining the term of leases of cell site space, land/ground, office buildings, and retail stores,
which are the most relevant lease contracts in the Group, the following are the most relevant factors
that are considered:

    - Rapidly advancing and ever-changing technology in the telecommunications industry requires
flexible lease contracts, i.e. management tries to minimize longer periods during which the
contracts cannot be canceled.

    - When determining whether an extension of a lease contract is reasonably certain, in addition
to any significant penalties for terminating (or not extending) the lease, business plans and
the business model are considered, e.g. cost/benefit analysis, consolidation plans for the
mobile network and office facilities, new mobile network standards, significance of the
property for the underlying operations, replacement or usage of additional technology, as well
as the availability and cost of alternative locations.

    - Often leasehold improvements can also be used in alternative locations. In many cases, the
costs of moving or replacing the asset or initial construction costs are not the main factor
considered when determining whether to extend or not to extend the lease.

    - Significant investments made in a location, e.g. construction of towers and masts on the
leased land, are economic penalties typically considered when determining the lease term.

After having considered all of the factors above, for cell site contracts the Group concluded that it is not
reasonably certain that an option to extend the lease term beyond the initial non-cancelable lease term
will be exercised. For cell site contracts, other than the MLA site leases with T-Infra, but including the
land/ground underneath the infrastructure, the lease term is on average 6 years and is considered
reasonably certain depending on the significance of the leasehold improvement. Extension options after
that period are typically not considered reasonably certain at commencement of the lease. Payments
associated with these optional periods are not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.

Most extension options for office and shop leases are not included in the lease liability, because the
Group could replace the leased assets without significant cost or business disruption. Exposure to
future additional cash outflows will only arise when an extension option (not determined to be
reasonably certain) is exercised or when a termination option (determined to be reasonably certain) is
not exercised.

F-41


-----

For the copper lines and MDF colocations within the asset category leased lines a portfolio approach is
used due to the volume of the leased lines. To determine the lease term a mathematical approach is
used in which the contract terms are leading. This is aligned with the strategically horizon of the Group.
For leased lines, statistical information can be additionally used to determine the lease term.

After the commencement date, the assessment of a reasonable certainty exercise is only reassessed if
a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs that affects this judgement, and this
is within the control of the lessee. T-Mobile reassesses the lease term when an option is exercised (or
not exercised) or it becomes obligated to exercise (or not exercise).

The cell site lease with T- Infra B.V. has an initial non-cancelable period of 15 years, during which the
lease contract cannot be terminated. The initial period of time is followed by two renewal periods of ten
years each (optional renewal period) and another unlimited numbers of further renewal periods of ten
years each (additional renewal) if not terminated. The Group has the right to terminate after the initial
term and before each optional and additional renewal, and T- Infra B.V. after the first additional
renewal period. The Group’s termination rights after the initial lease term and after the two optional
renewal periods, are options to extend the lease. This means that the non-cancelable period ends
when the Group can exercise its termination right, and for any following periods the Group has
effectively an option to extend, i.e. an unilateral right not to terminate the contract. As a consequence,
management of the Group had to assess for what periods it is reasonably certain that it does not
exercise the option and will thereby not extend the contract beyond the non-cancellable period.
Management came to the conclusion that it is not reasonably certain that the option to renew the lease
after the non-cancelable lease term of 15 years will be exercised. Therefore, the lease term under the
application of IFRS 16 is deemed to be 15 years. This is in line with the strategic horizon of the Group.

In determining the lease term, management applies judgement and considers all facts and
circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise an extension option, or not
to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only
included in the lease term, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend the lease,
or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. The threshold for a “reasonably certain” exercise is
lower than “virtually certain” and higher than “more likely than not” under IAS 37 “Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.”

**2.13** **SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The main asset and liability items in the consolidated balance sheet are measured as follows:

**Items in the statement of financial position:** **Measurement principle:**

**Assets:**
_Current assets:_
Cash and cash equivalents Amortized cost

Trade and other receivables Depending on the underlying business model in each individual
case: at amortized cost, at fair value through other
comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) with recycling to profit or
loss, or at fair value through profit or loss. FVOCI receivables
are high quality receivables (highly liquid) and factored right
after inception and as such, no movement in OCI.

Contract assets Amortized cost

Other assets Amortized cost

Current income taxes Amount expected to be recovered from the taxation authorities

Inventories Lower of net realizable value and cost

The material principles on recognition and measurement outlined below were applied uniformly to all
accounting periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.

**2.13.1 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (EXCLUDING GOODWILL)**

Intangible assets with finite useful lives, including UMTS, LTE licenses, 5G licenses and software, are
measured at cost and generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Such assets
are impaired if their recoverable amount, which is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and value in use, is lower than the carrying amount.

The useful lives and the amortization methods of the assets are reviewed at least at each financial
yearend and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as changes
in accounting estimates in accordance with IAS 8. Amortization of mobile communications licenses
begins as soon as the related network is ready for use. The useful lives of mobile communications
licenses are determined based on several factors, including the term of the licenses granted by the
respective regulatory body in each country, the availability and expected cost of renewing the licenses,
as well as the development of future technologies.

F-43


-----

The useful lives of the Group most important mobile communications licenses and software is as
follows:

**Years:**
Mobile communication licences (2G/3G/4G/5G) 11-20
Software 2-5
Other Intangibles 8-1 5

Expenditures for intangible assets (e.g. software) incurred during the development phase are
capitalized once finalized and if they meet the criteria for recognition as assets and are amortized over
their useful lives. Research expenditures are expensed as incurred. Development is the application of
research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially
improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems, or services prior to the commencement of
commercial production or use. Examples of activities typically included in development are the design,
construction and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models involving new technology.

The development phase is deemed complete when the IT department has formally documented that
the capitalized asset is ready for its intended use. After transfer of the assets, amortization starts.

**2.13.2 GOODWILL**

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment based on the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the goodwill is allocated (impairment-only approach). The impairment test is
carried out at the end of each financial year, as well as whenever there are indications that the carrying
amount of the cash-generating unit has to be impaired.

**2.13.3 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less (accumulated) straight-line depreciation, and
impairment losses, if applicable. The depreciation period is based on the expected useful life of the
assets. Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated pro rata temporis in the year of
acquisition. The residual values, useful lives, and the depreciation methods of the assets are reviewed
at least at each financial yearend and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are
accounted for as changes in accounting estimates in accordance with IAS 8.

In addition to directly attributable costs, the costs of internally developed assets include proportionate
indirect material and labor costs, as well as administrative expenses relating to production or the
provision of services. In addition to the purchase price and costs directly attributable to bringing the
asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended
by management, costs also include the estimated costs for dismantling and removing the asset, and
restoring the site on which it is located. If an item of property, plant and equipment consists of several
components with different estimated useful lives, those components that are significant are depreciated
over their individual useful lives.

Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Public investment grants reduce the cost of
the assets for which the grants were made.

On disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal, the carrying amount of the item is derecognized. The gain or loss
arising from the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net
disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item and is recognized as other operating
income or other operating expenses when the item is derecognized.

The useful lives of material asset categories are presented in the following table:

**Years:**
Installation, machinery & equipment 3-30
Other non-current assets 5-20
Leasehold improvements 5-10

F-44


-----

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or applicable lease
terms.

**2.13.4 BORROWING COSTS**

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a
qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. The Group defines qualifying assets as
construction projects or other assets for which a period of at least 12 months is necessary in order to
get them ready for their intended use or sale. Borrowing costs relating to assets measured at fair value
are not capitalized.

**2.13.5 IMPAIRMENTS OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS (INCLUDING GOODWILL) AND ITEMS OF**
**PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS**

Impairments are identified by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount. If individual
assets do not generate future cash flows independently from other assets, recoverability is assessed
on the basis of the cash-generating unit to which the assets can be allocated. At each reporting date,
the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit must be determined. In
addition, impairment tests are carried out for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill) and
intangible assets not yet available for use on a yearly basis.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each
of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the
carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable
amount, goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit must be reduced in the amount of the
difference. Impairment losses for goodwill must not be reversed. If the impairment loss recognized for
the cash-generating unit exceeds the carrying amount of the allocated goodwill, the additional amount
of the impairment loss is to be distributed on a pro-rata basis to the assets allocated to the cashgenerating unit. The fair values or values in use (if measurable) of the individual assets shall be
considered to be the minimum values. If the reasons for previously recognized impairments no longer
exist, the impairment losses on the assets concerned (with the exception of goodwill) must be
reversed.

The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and the value in use. The recoverable amount is generally determined by means of a
discounted cash flow (‘DCF)’ calculation, unless it can be determined on the basis of a market price.
These DCF calculations use projections that are based on financial budgets approved by management
covering a ten-year period and are also used for internal purposes. The planning horizon reflects the
assumptions for short- to mid-term market developments. Cash flows beyond the ten-year period are
extrapolated using appropriate growth rates. For the key assumptions on which management has
based its calculation of the recoverable amount, please refer to Note 2.11.13.

**2.13.6 INVENTORIES**

Inventories are carried at cost on initial recognition and are subsequently measured at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is measured using the
weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is the estimated standalone selling price in the
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the necessary estimated selling
expenses.

**2.13.7 PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes with different pension
providers. The Group pays contributions to the pension insurance provider on a contractual basis and
has no further obligations once the contributions have been paid. Due to the fact that all risks were
transferred, no further transactions for post-employment benefit plans were necessary.

F-45


-----

**T-Mobile Netherlands Retail B.V.**

T-Mobile Netherlands Retail B.V. employees who work in shops participate in the defined benefit
scheme financed with a collective fixed annual premium with the industry-wide pension fund for the
retail industry. T-Mobile accounts for the defined benefit scheme with the industry-wide pension fund
for the retail industry as though it was a defined contribution scheme. In the event of a deficit at the
industry-wide pension fund, the Group has no obligation to pay supplementary contributions.

The pension fund carries an indexed career average pension scheme. These defined benefit plans are
recognized as defined contribution plans because the funds accounts are not designed to be able to
identify the part of the pension liabilities and assets belonging to the Group. The Group is obliged to
pay a pre-agreed contribution to these plans. The Group is not entitled to any surplus and is not liable
for any deficit, except by future adjustments to the contribution rates. The actual coverage ratio of
‘Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Detailhandel’ at 31 December 2020 was 111% (112.5% at
31 December 2019), an decrease of 1.3% compared to 31 December 2019. Stichting
Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Detailhandel is a multiemployer plan because a collectively
bargained plan is maintained by more than one employer within the same industry. At the end of 2020
there were 32,000 employers participating in the pension fund (2019: 30,000). T-Mobile is one of the
many participants in this pension fund and our exposure is limited. The expected contribution for 2020
is EUR 1,758 thousand (2019: EUR 1,466 thousand).

**2.13.8 OTHER PROVISIONS**

Other provisions are recognized for current legal or constructive obligations to third parties that are
uncertain with regard to their timing or their amount. Provisions are recognized for these obligations
provided they relate to past transactions or events, will probably require an outflow of resources to
settle, and this outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions are carried at their expected settlement
amount, taking into account all identifiable risks and uncertainties.

The settlement amount is calculated on the basis of a best estimate. Suitable estimation methods and
sources of information are used depending on the characteristics of the obligation. In case of a number
of similar obligations, the Group of obligations is treated as one single obligation. The expected value
method is used as the estimation method.

If there is a range of potential events with the same probability of occurrence, the average value is
taken. Individual obligations (e.g. legal and litigation risks) are regularly evaluated based on the most
probable outcome, provided an exceptional probability distribution does not mean that other estimates
would lead to a more appropriate evaluation. The measurement of provisions is based on past
experience, current costing and price information, as well as estimates and reports from experts.

If experience or current costing or price information is used to determine the settlement amount, these
values are extrapolated to the expected settlement date. Suitable price trend indicators (e.g.
construction price indexes or inflation rates) are used for this purpose.

Provisions are discounted for the time value of money. Provisions are discounted using pre-tax market
interest rates that reflect the term of the obligation and the risk associated with it (insofar as not already
taken into consideration in the calculation of the settlement amount). Reimbursement claims are not
netted against provisions; they are recognized separately as soon as their realization is virtually
certain.

Provisions for decommissioning, restoration, and similar obligations arising from the acquisition of
property, plant and equipment are offset by a corresponding increase in the capitalized cost of the
relevant asset. Changes at a later date in estimates of the amount or timing of payments or changes to
the interest rate applied in measuring such obligations also result in retrospective increases or
decreases in the carrying amount of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. These in turn
change the depreciation of the asset to be recognized in the future, which leads to the changes in
estimates being recognized in profit or loss over the remaining useful life.

F-46


-----

Where the decrease in the amount of a provision exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset, the
excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**2.13.9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

Financial instruments are recognized as soon as the Group becomes a party to the contractual
regulations of the financial instrument. For regular purchases or sales, the settlement date is relevant
for the initial recognition and derecognition. This is the day on which the asset is delivered to or by the
Group. In general, financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in
the statement of financial position when, and only when, the entity currently has a right to offset the
recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis.

Transferred financial assets are derecognized in full, if substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred or if some of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred (risk
sharing) and the acquirer has both the legal and the practical ability to sell the assets to a third party. If,
in cases where risk is shared, the acquirer is unable to sell the assets to a third party, the assets will
continue to be recognized to the extent of the maximum risk retained. Financial liabilities are
derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract expires or if there is a substantial
modification of the terms of the contract.

**Financial assets**

Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, financial lease receivables and
other receivables. In Note 2.13.10 the accounting policies on financial assets are disclosed.

**Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities include financial liabilities that are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost.
In Note 2.13.11 the accounting policies on financial liabilities are disclosed.

**2.13.10 FINANCIAL ASSETS**

**a) Classification**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

    - those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income
or through profit or loss), and

    - those to be measured at amortized cost.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the
contractual terms of the cash flows.

**b) Initial recognition and measurement**

Financial assets are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. For all financial assets not
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’), the transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition are taken into account plus, in the case of debt instruments, a loss
account for expected credit losses. The fair values recognized in the statement of financial position are
generally based on market prices of the financial assets. If these are not available, the fair value is
determined using standard valuation models on the basis of current market parameters.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual
cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. In order for a financial
asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive
income, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on
the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at
an instrument level.

F-47


-----

The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets
in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from
collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.

**c) Subsequent measurement**

Subsequent measurement depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and the
cash flow characteristics of the asset.

The Group has only financial assets that are classified as cash and cash equivalents, trade
receivables, finance lease receivables and originated loans and other receivables. The measurement
of these financial assets is described below.

**d) Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash accounts including Group cash pooling and short-term cash
deposits at banks; they have maturities of up to three months at initial recognition and are measured at
amortized cost.

**e) Trade receivables and originated loans and other receivables**

Trade receivables are recognized initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional, unless
they contain significant financing components, then they are recognized at fair value. Instruments with
a significant financing component are initially measured at fair value.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured depending on the
underlying business model at amortized cost, less impairment, fair value through other comprehensive
income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or
costs. For more information on receivables, reference is made to Note 2.13 for the accounting policies
and Note 4 Trade and Other receivables.

**f) Receivables from free-standing other derivative financial instruments**

The Group applies an enhanced Binomial Option Pricing Model that allows for exercising of options
before the end of the option’s life. This applies to an option presented in the comparative figures of the
financial statements and refers to Simpel. No option is valued in the current reporting period.

The Binomial Option Pricing Model computes enterprise value estimates for each step in-time between
the valuation date and the option or warrant expiration date; effectively resulting in a binomial tree. At
each final node of the tree (i.e. at expiration of the option) the option value is simply its intrinsic or
exercise value. Under the risk neutrality assumption, today’s fair price of a derivative is equal to the
discounted expected value of its future payoff. Therefore, at each earlier node of the tree, the option
value is calculated using the option values from the next two nodes weighted by their respective
probabilities. The expected value is then discounted at the risk-free rate. The valuation method is
based on the enterprise value at valuation date, the volatility rate of the enterprise value based on the
average median of the asset volatility of the peer group, the risk free interest rate based on the
German government bond yield as at valuation date. Any derivatives financial assets that are not a part
an effective hedging relationship are measured at fair value through profit or loss. For further
information on Binomial Option Pricing model used for Simpel call option agreement, reference is
made in Note 19.

F-48


-----

**g) Derecognition**

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial
assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e. removed from the Group’s consolidated statement of financial
position) when:

   - The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired

Or

   - The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a
‘pass-through arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the
asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to
the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability.
The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and
obligations that the Group has retained.

**h) Impairment of financial assets**

The Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held
at fair value through profit or loss. The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring
expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and
contract assets. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have
been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets
relate to services provided, respectively handsets sold but not yet billed and have substantially the
same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group has
therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation
of the loss rates for the contract assets.

**2.13.11 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES**

**a) Initial recognition and measurement**

Financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition. For all financial liabilities not
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to
the acquisition are also a component of the carrying amount. If the contractual payment term for
liabilities to suppliers is longer than the normal credit period in the relevant procurement market at this
point in time, this liability is reported under other interest-bearing liabilities in financial liabilities instead
of trade payables. A financing agreement of this nature is shown as a non-cash transaction in the
statement of cash flows and the relevant repayment of the financial liability reported under net cash
from/used in financing activities. This applies regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable or
not.

**b) Subsequent measurement**

The Group has only financial liabilities that are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost (‘AC’).
The measurement of financial liabilities at amortized cost are described below.

**c) Financial liabilities at amortized cost**

Loans and borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the consolidated income statement over

F-49


-----

the period of the loan using the effective interest method. In the statement of cash flows, the Group
has classified cash payments for group loans as financing activities. The interest paid and received is
classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement.

**d) Derecognition**

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or
expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an
exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a
new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the consolidated
income statement.

**e) Determination of fair value**

The fair value of financial instruments not listed in an active market, is determined by using appropriate
valuation techniques. Valuation techniques include net present value techniques, comparison to similar
instruments for which market observable prices exist, options pricing models and other relevant
valuation models.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are
categorized within the fair value hierarchy. This is described, as follows, based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

   - Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

   - Level 2—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly observable

   - Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable

**2.13.12 CONTINGENCIES (CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES)**

Contingencies (contingent assets and liabilities) are potential assets or liabilities arising from past
events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more
uncertain future events not entirely within the control of the Group. Contingent liabilities are also
present obligations that arise from past events for which an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits is not probable or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient
reliability. Contingent liabilities are only recognized at their fair value if they were assumed in the
course of a business combination.

Contingent liabilities not assumed in the course of a business combination are not recognized.
Contingent assets are not recognized. However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then
the related asset is no longer a contingent asset, but it is recognized as an asset. Information on
contingent liabilities is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless the
possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. The same applies to
contingent assets where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

**2.13.13 LEASES**

A lease is an agreement in which the lessor conveys the right to use an asset for an agreed period of
time to the lessee in return for a payment or series of payments. The scope of IFRS 16 covers
standard lease, rental, and tenancy agreements as well as agreements in which the lessee is granted
other rights to use assets. A lease only exists if the right-of-use asset is within the control of the lessee.
The lessee has control when it has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from
use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset. The interest paid and
received is classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement.

F-50


-----

**a) Lessee**

At the commencement date, a right-of-use asset measured at cost and a lease liability measured at the
present value of the future lease payments must be recognized in the statement of financial position for
all leases. This also applies to leases for which the underlying asset is of low value and to short-term
leases (lease term of no more than twelve months). Non-lease components are not separated from
lease components, i.e. all non-lease payments due under the contract are also recognized in the
statement of financial position, except for the service components for buildings and shops. These costs
are separated from the lease payments and recognized as service fees. This principle does not include
contracts relating to data centers, which due to their special requirements in terms of equipment and
premises form their own separate class of underlying asset. For this class of underlying assets, the
non-lease payments are recognized as an expense.

The lease liability is recognized at the present value of the future lease payments over the reasonably
certain period of use. Lease payments are all fixed and in-substance payments, less any future lease
incentives payable by the lessor. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, expected
payments under residual value guarantees, and payments for reasonably certain purchase and
termination options are also recognized. The series of payments is discounted at the interest rate
implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing
rate. All other variable payments are recognized as an expense. The lease liability is measured using
the effective interest method and adjusted.

The cost of the right-of-use asset is determined as the amount of the initial measurement of the lease
liability plus any initial direct costs incurred for obtaining the lease, the costs of installing the leased
asset, and an estimate of any future restoration costs, less any lease incentives received from the
lessor. In subsequent measurement, the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over
the lease term and, if applicable, adjusted for any impairment losses. If ownership of the leased asset
is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term, or if it is reasonably certain that a purchase or
sale option will exist, the right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the end of
the useful life of the underlying asset.

The lease term is the period in which it is reasonably certain that an asset will be leased. In addition to
the non-cancelable period of a lease, extensions will be included if their exercise is reasonably certain
at the commencement of the lease term. This estimate is only to be reassessed upon occurrence of an
event that necessitates a change. The lease term will be revised if an extension option not previously
included in the entity’s determination of the lease term is exercised or a termination option not
previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term is not exercised. The adjustment of
the lease term leads to a change in the future series of payments and therefore to remeasurement of
the lease liability using a market rate of interest. The difference is recognized outside profit or loss as
part of the cost of the right-of-use asset. Amounts derecognized that exceed the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset are recognized as an expense in profit or loss.

A lease modification that substantially increases the scope of the original lease is accounted for as a
separate lease if the lessee is granted an additional right to use one or more underlying assets and the
consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the standalone price for the
increase in scope that the lessee would otherwise have to pay for use if it had leased these assets
from a third party under a separate lease.

Lease modifications that increase the scope of the lease but do not lead to the recognition of a
separate lease are recognized outside profit or loss as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset and the lease liability for the existing lease. If a lease modification decreases the
scope of the lease, the lessee must remeasure both the right-of-use asset and the lease liability and
recognize any gain or loss on a pro-rata basis in profit or loss. The modified leases are measured at
the modification date with the new, applicable interest rate. In the statement of cash flows, the Group
has classified cash payments for leases as financing activities.

F-51


-----

**b) Lessor**

If substantially all risks and rewards are attributable to the lessor (operating lease), the leased asset is
recognized in the statement of financial position by the lessor. Measurement of the leased asset is then
based on the accounting policies applicable to that asset. The lease payments are recognized in profit
or loss by the lessor. Contractually defined future changes in the lease payments during the term of the
lease are recognized as revenue from leases on a straight-line basis over the entire lease term, which
is defined only once at the inception date of the contract. Where extension options exist, the exercise
of those extension options that are reasonably certain is initially taken into account at the time the
lease is concluded. If, contrary to the original expectation, these options are exercised or not exercised
during the lease term, the estimated term will be adjusted and taken into account in the calculation of
future lease revenue from operating lease transactions.

If substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset are attributable to the
lessee (finance lease), the lessor recognizes at the commencement date, in place of the leased asset,
a finance lease receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The net investment in
the lease is defined as the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the unearned
finance income. The lease payments made by the lessees are split into an interest component and a
principal component using the effective interest method. In subsequent measurement, the lease
receivable is reduced by the principal received. The interest component of the payments received is
recognized as finance income in the income statement.

For sale and leaseback transactions, if there is a transfer of control within the meaning of IFRS 15, the
Group as the seller-lessee measures the asset at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the
asset that relates to the right of use retained. Any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to
the lessor is recognized in profit or loss as the selling profit or loss. If there is no transfer of control, the
transaction is recognized as a financing transaction. The underlying asset that is legally the subject of
the lease is not derecognized and is not recognized as a lease.

**2.13.14 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PROGRAMS**

**Stock appreciation rights**

Liabilities for the Group’s share appreciation rights are recognized as employee benefit expense over
the relevant service period. The liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date and are
presented as employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.

For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods and services acquired and the liability
incurred have to be recognized at the fair value of the liability. The fair value of the liability has to be
remeasured at each reporting date and at the settlement date, and the changes in the fair value have
to be recognized in profit and loss, until the liability is settled.

**2.13.15 NET REVENUE, CONTRACT ASSETS, CONTRACT LIABILITIES AND CAPITALIZED**
**CONTRACT COSTS**

Net revenues include all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Group. Ordinary activities
refer to the core business and to other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services.

Revenues are recorded net of value-added tax and other taxes collected from customers. Value-added
tax and other taxes collected are remitted to governmental authorities.

Net revenues are recognized in accordance with the provision of goods or services, provided that
collectability of the consideration is probable. For service contracts with a continuous service provision,
the contractually agreed total consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the
minimum contract term, regardless of the payment pattern.

A contract asset must be recognized if the Group recorded revenue for fulfilment of a contractual
performance obligation before the due date of the consideration from the customer.

F-52


-----

A contract liability must be recognized when the customer paid consideration or a receivable from the
customer is due before the Group fulfilled a contractual performance obligation and thus recognized
revenue. In a customer contract, contract liabilities must be set off against contract assets.

Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services (e.g.
mobile service contract plus handset) must be separated into distinct performance obligations, based
on the standalone selling price that is recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the
customer. In the Group, this especially concerns the sale of a mobile handset or other
telecommunications equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed-network
telecommunications service contract. The total transaction price of the bundled contract is allocated
among the individual performance obligations based on their relative—possibly estimated—standalone
selling prices, i.e. based on a ratio of the standalone selling price of each separate element to the
aggregated standalone selling prices of the contractual performance obligations. The Group does not
sell own produced products (e.g. handsets).

As a result, the revenue to be recognized for products (often delivered in advance) such as mobile
handsets that are sold in combination with a long-term service contract may be either higher or lower
than the amount billed or collected, depending on the ratio for these products relative to the
aggregated standalone selling prices.

This leads to the recognition of what is known as a contract asset or a contract liability in the statement
of financial position, depending on whether the revenue recognized is higher (contract asset) or lower
(contract liability) compared to the amount billed or collected. The contract asset is a receivable arising
from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence. This leads to higher revenue,
in contrast to the amounts billed from the sale of goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the
provision of services. The contract liability is an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer
for which the entity has received consideration, or for which an amount of consideration is due from the
customer. The contract liability is reversed and reduced over the remaining contract period, increasing
revenue from the other performance obligations (in this: mobile service revenues) and results in lower
revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise compared with the amounts billed.

As distinct from promotional offers, options to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or
at a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is
deferred as a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires, providing the discount on future
purchases is an implicit component of the consideration for the current contract and is also significant.
The measure of significance is whether the decision by the (average) customer to enter into the current
contract is likely to have been significantly influenced by their right to the future discount. Offers for
volume discounts for the purchase of additional core products of an entity (e.g. a discount offered on
an additional fixed-network contract for mobile customers) are classed by the Group as promotional
offers to be excluded from consideration.

Long-term customer receivables (e.g. arising from sales of handsets in instalments), contract assets (in
connection with the conclusion of a long-term customer contract) or contract liabilities (e.g. arising from
a prepayment by the customer) are recognized at present value if the financing component is
significant in relation to the total contract value (i.e. including those performance obligations that do not
contain a financing component). The discount rate also reflects the customer credit risk. The Group
makes use of the option not to recognize a significant financing component if the period between when
a good or service is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service
will be one year or less.

Payments to customers including credits or subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in
revenue unless the payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service from the customer,
for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated.

Gross versus net presentation: In cases where a company is in an intermediary position between
another supplier/vendor (e.g. manufacturer, wholesaler) and a retail customer, it must be assessed
whether the company itself supplies the relevant product or provides the service requested by the
customer as the principal or whether the company merely acts as the agent for the supplier. The

F-53


-----

outcome determines whether the entity can recognize revenue on a gross basis (as the principal) or on
a net basis after deducting the costs to the supplier (as the agent). For the Group, the question arises
particularly in the case of digital services (e.g. streaming services) purchased from third parties and
sold to retail customers as part of the Group’s product portfolio.

In summary, in case of rights to another party’s goods or services, the Group considers itself to be the
principal vis-à-vis the retail customer, if all of the following conditions are met and thus reports gross
revenues:

   - The Group either has a contractual enforceable right to receive the predefined services “on
demand” at predefined (fixed or variable) prices, and accordingly the other party has entered
into an enforceable ongoing commitment to provide them, or the Group has entered into a
material minimum purchase commitment.

   - The Group sells access to the other party’s services in its own name and for its own account
under a contract between the Group and the retail customer.

   - The Group has discretion in setting the price for the other party’s services sold for its own
account.

Contract costs comprise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commissions paid
to employees in the direct sales channel and third-party retailers in the indirect sales channel) and the
costs to fulfil a contract. These must be capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be
compensated by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are
additional costs that would have not been incurred had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfil
a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve
the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be capitalized under
any other standard. The Group makes not use of the option to immediately recognize contract costs
whose amortization period would be less than one year as an expense; this is in line with the DT group
accounting policy.

The capitalized contract costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
customer retention period. The expenses are disclosed in the Group’s income statement, not under
depreciation and amortization but—depending on the sales channel—as goods and services
purchased or personnel costs.

In the indirect sales channel, third-party retailers often arrange service contracts on behalf of and for
the account of the Group (as the agent), whereas in connection with the sale of handsets the thirdparty retailers act in their own name and for their own account (as the principal). In such cases, the
third-party retailer receives the gross consideration of the handset from the Group and the same is
recognized as loan receivable from the end-customer by the Group.

In the direct sales channel the sale of subsidized handsets in connection with the conclusion of service
contracts (multiple-element arrangement) is still common with business customers. In the subsidy
model, an asset must thus be carried at the date of revenue recognition which is generally settled over
a 24-months service contract term through payments made by the business customer, whereby the
contract asset is repaid through the portion of the monthly invoice that exceeds the allocated monthly
service revenues.

Depending on the business model, revenue recognition at the Group is as follows:

The mobile and fixed network business includes mobile services, narrow- and broadband access to the
fixed network and the internet, television via internet, connection and roaming fees billed to other
mobile operators (wholesale business), sales, other telecommunications equipment and accessories.
Revenue generated from the use of voice and data communications as well as television via internet is
recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. The services rendered relate to use by customers
(e.g. call minutes), availability over time (e.g. monthly flat rates), or other agreed rate plans. Revenue
and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are
recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled company obligations that
affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement. The Group does not have warranties or
related obligations.

F-54


-----

Trade-in rights for used handsets which are granted to customers upon contract conclusion under the
condition of a new purchase transaction (including renewal of an existing service contract) do not
constitute repurchase arrangements; however, if the repurchase prices exceed the fair value of the
handsets these rights must be recognized as separate performance obligations for which part of the
contractual revenue is deferred until they are exercised or expire.

Particularly in the mobile communications business, the timing of payments for mobile handsets
purchased in connection with the conclusion of a service contract differs from the timing of the delivery and
hence from revenue recognition. Where a significant financing component exists, revenue is measured at
the present value. In case of a sale of handsets in connection with the conclusion of service contracts in
the consumer business, the payment-by-instalment model is offered to customers. In the
payment-by-instalment model, a handset loan must thus be carried at the date of revenue recognition
which is generally repaid over a 24-month service contract term through payments made by the customer.

**2.13.16 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

**_Other short-term employee’s benefits_**

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as
the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under shortterm liabilities if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result
of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably.

**2.13.17 INCOME TAXES**

Income taxes include current income taxes as well as deferred taxes. Current and deferred tax assets
and liabilities must be recognized where they are probable. They are measured in accordance with the
tax laws applicable or already announced as of the reporting date, provided said announcement has
the effect of actual enactment.

Where current and deferred taxes are recognized, it must be reported as income or expense except to
the extent that the tax arises from a transaction which is recognized outside profit and loss, either in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, or in connection with a business combination.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
offset in the statement of financial position, if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities, has an intention to settle net, and the deferred tax assets and
the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities must be recognized in the amount that the Group expects
to settle or recover from the tax authorities. They include liabilities/receivables for the current period as
well as for prior periods.

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the
consolidated statement of financial position and the tax base, as well as for tax loss carryforwards and
tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be
available to utilize those temporary differences and losses. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are
reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future
taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax
rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income
taxes, if any. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from
the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount
of its assets and liabilities.

By way of derogation from this principle, deferred taxes are not recognized for temporary differences if
deferred taxes arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction which is not a
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable
profit/tax loss. Deferred taxes are not recognized for temporary differences arising from the initial
recognition of goodwill.

F-55


-----

Deferred taxes are generally recognized for temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, joint arrangements, and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.

expected to be recovered more than twelve months after reporting period. This non-current receivable
balance relates to the long term portion of handset loans that are provided to customers and are to be
repaid in monthly installments over a period of not more than 24 months.

As per 31 December 2020 the credit loss allowance amounts to EUR 95.5 million (31 December 2019:
EUR 85.8 million). Reference is made to Note 32 for additional information.

Due to the short-term nature of the trade receivables, their carrying amount approximates their fair
value. For non-current receivables, their carrying amount approximates their fair value as well.

The Group is party to factoring agreements under which it sells trade receivables on a revolving basis. The
carrying amounts of the trade receivables include receivables which are subject to such factoring
agreements. Under these factoring agreements T-Mobile has transferred the relevant receivables to banks
in exchange for cash. Further reference is made to the Note 32 Transfer of assets (factoring of receivables).

In 2019, the framework site sharing contracts were classified for the first time as net investment in a
lease. The Group has framework site sharing agreements in a reciprocal manner with other Dutch
telecom operators. The net investment in the lease is valued at 15 years which is equal to the
non-cancelation term of the master lease agreement between the Group and T- Infra B.V.. The interest
rate implicit in the lease of 8.5% is used to determine the net investment in the lease.

In 2020, significant movements occurred in the year including the purchase of the mobile
communications license for EUR 400 million which is part of the additions amounting to EUR
418 million in total, the acquisition of Simpel resulted in Business combination additions of EUR
334 million. In the prior year 2019, two significant movements occurred: the acquisition of Tele2 which
resulted as addition and the disposal of T- Infra B.V. Completion of assets under construction caused
transfers to different assets categories.

**SOFTWARE**

Software consists of capitalized development costs (internally generated software) and external
purchased software. Of the total amount of capitalized software, EUR 74.7 million is internally
generated software (31 December 2019: EUR 98.8 million). Pursuant to Dutch Law, capitalized
development costs require maintaining a legal reserve which is non distributable. Please see Note 39
for further details.

**GOODWILL**

Goodwill is monitored and tested for impairment by management at the level of the three operating
segments (CGUs) as determined in Note 18. The segments represent the lowest level within the entity
at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The impairment test for the
goodwill was performed for the ending balance of the current period (31 December 2020) for the
Company that includes Tele2 and Simpel. The annual impairment test for the goodwill as of
31 December 2020 did not result into an impairment for any of the CGUs.

F-59


-----

The recoverable amounts to be identified for the impairment test were determined on the basis of the
value in use. These figures were calculated using a net present value approach. The main parameters
are shown in the table below. Input for the calculations for the recoverable amounts are the ten-year
business planning projections, which are based on financial plans that have been approved by
management and are also used for internal management purposes.

The key assumptions on which management has based its determination of the recoverable amount
include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on
past experience and extended to include internal expectations, and that are underscored by external
market data and estimates:

    - development of revenue,

    - customer acquisition and retention costs,

    - churn rates,

    - capital expenditure,

    - market share, and

    - growth rates.

Discount rates are determined on the basis of external figures derived from the market, taking account
of the market and country risks associated with the cash-generating unit. Changes in the assumptions
may have a negative impact, as a result of future macro-economic trends, continued intense
competition, further possible legislation changes (e.g. as part of national austerity programs) and
regulatory intervention.

Neither the impairment test nor the review on the accuracy of the forecast give rise to an indication of
impairment. The goodwill impairment test resulted in a significant headroom of the value in use as
compared to the carrying value. The goodwill of Simpel is completely attributable to the Consumer
segment as the customer base of Simpel only consist of sim-only customers in the Consumer market.

Since the acquisition of Tele2 at the beginning of 2019, the chief operating decision maker (board of
management) examines the company’s performance based on its customer characteristics as opposed
to the company as a whole and identified the three operating segments. The goodwill is therefore
monitored and tested on a segment level as from 2019.

The following tables set out the key assumptions for the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated:

**GOODWILL**

Management’s approach used to determine the CGU’ value in use for 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

**Assumption:** **Approach used to determine values:**

Revenue growth Average annual growth rate over the ten-year forecast period; based
on past performance and management’s expectations of market
development.

Sales price Average annual growth rate over the ten-year forecast period; based
on current industry trends and including long term inflation forecasts.

EBITDA margin Based on past performance and management’s expectations for the
future.

Sustainable Growth rate This is the weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash
flows beyond the detailed planning period. The rates are based on the
expectations of management regarding the valorisation of new
technologies and market growth.

Annual capital expenditure Expected cash costs in the CGU. This is based on the historical
experience of management.

**OTHER INTANGIBLES**

Other intangibles consist of customer relationships and favorable contracts identified at the acquisition
of Orange, Tele2 and Simpel amounting to EUR 257 million (2019: EUR 175 million) and the trademark
Simpel amounting to EUR 15 million (2019: EUR 0).

**ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Depending on the nature of the specific project, assets under construction (AUC) are either presented
under intangible assets or property, plant and equipment. Assets under construction in the tables
above mainly represent projects associated with new software or significant upgrades to existing
software which have not been implemented yet.

When projects included in assets under construction (both under intangible assets or property, plant
and equipment) are completed, the capitalized amount is allocated to the respective asset class which
can result into a transfer within the same asset class, from intangible fixed assets to property, plant and
equipment or the opposite way.

Regarding the entity-wide disclosures, we do not meet the requirement to disclose geographic
information, as we have no sales and no non-current assets outside the Netherlands.

The total transaction price attributable to performance obligations that have not been fulfilled or, in
some cases, not yet fulfilled at the end of the reporting year (hereinafter: outstanding transaction price)
amounts to EUR 305 million (2019: EUR 421 million).

The portion of the outstanding transaction price attributable to performance obligations that have not
been fulfilled or, in some cases, not yet fulfilled at the end of the reporting year is generally recognized
as revenue over the remaining term of the service contracts concluded. Since most service contracts—
unless they can be canceled at any time—have a minimum contract term of 24 months, an average
remaining term of approximately 12 months can be assumed, provided the course of business in the
mass business remains virtually unchanged. The disclosures only refer to transactions within the scope
of IFRS 15, i.e. they do not include portions of the transaction price being allocated to performance
obligations outside the scope of the standard, e.g. leases.

The initial option fair value of EUR 0.5 million in relation to Simpel was based on the fair value at the
option agreement signing date in the financial year 2019, the fair value at the acquisition date as per
the valuation technique of Level 3 input Binomial option pricing model in accordance to IFRS 13.91
was determined to be EUR 26.4 million and subsequently EUR 25.9 million is recognized in the profit
and loss account other operating income in 2020. The gain in fair value represents the improved
outlook of Simpel. After exercising the option to acquire Simpel in 2020, the balance of the option
amounts to zero as per 31 December 2020.

The valuation technique of the Binomial option pricing model was carried out. The method was based
on the enterprise value at valuation date, the volatility rate of the enterprise value of 27.9% based on
the average median of the asset volatility of the peer group, the risk free interest rate of minus 0.72%
based on the seven months German government bond yield as at valuation date, the remaining
exercise period is 7 months from the valuation date (up and including 30 June 2021), and the dividend
yield is assumed to be zero during the remaining life.

In 2007 and 2010, the Group effected a demerger of its entire business (i.e. all assets and liabilities)
including its operating company subsidiaries in exchange for shares emitted to T-Mobile Netherlands
Holding B.V. These transactions resulted in step-ups in the tax basis (temporary differences) in the fiscal
unity T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. As a result of the acquisition of Tele2 Netherlands Holding N.V.
(and its affiliates) a revaluation was done and resulted in a step-up in tax basis on 1 January 2019.

The deferred tax asset recognized in the balance sheet relates for the main part to the abovementioned step ups. 2020 resulted in a tax loss for which a deferred tax asset is recognized.

**29.** **CONTINGENCIES**

**CONTINGENT LIABILITIES**

The Group is involved in various disputes or claims arising in the normal course of business. In the
opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome of the disputes will not have a material effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Group. Management intends to defend the claims
vigorously.

T-Mobile has reached a settlement agreement with certain claim organizations related to all-in telecom
contracts, whereby the price of the mobile phone was not presented separately in the telecom contract.
There are some claim organizations which T-Mobile has not yet reached a settlement agreement with
and it is also not certain that such settlement will be included. For these organizations, T-Mobile has
not yet received all the necessary information to process the related claims. Consequently, T-Mobile is
not able to make a reliable estimate of the possible compensations nor of any reimbursements.

Due to current developments in the copper market, T-Mobile is aware of the fact that additional
expenses will be incurred in the future to adequately continue our services to our clients. However, as
deliberations with external parties are still ongoing, T-Mobile is currently not able to make a reliable
estimate of the possible unavoidable expenses related to the developments in the copper market.

**BANK GUARANTEES**

The Group or its subsidiaries have issued bank guarantees in the amount of EUR 3.6 million
(31 December 2019: EUR 3.6 million).

**OTHER COMMITMENTS**

At 31 December 2020, the Group entered into various contracts resulting in commitments of
EUR 220 million (31 December 2019: EUR 333 million), of which EUR 33.2 million relates to property,
plant & equipment and EUR 0.5 million to intangible assets.

The Group has a partnership agreement with Primevest to roll-out Fiber-to-the-Home (FttH) throughout
the Netherlands. The first subcluster, Segbroek in The Hague, was delivered in November 2019. The
Group has a minimum commitment of 20% of 10 years amounting EUR 5.7 million.

**30.** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS**

As per 2017 T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. introduced a Stock Appreciation Right (SAR) Scheme
over a period of five years. The Group offers the eligible employees SARs with the option to either
(i) participate in the Scheme in full (100%), (ii) participate in the Scheme for 50% or (iii) not participate in
the Scheme at all. The eligible participants consisting of T-Mobile board of management, Leadership
Team and Managers have signed up. In order to participate in the Scheme, the eligible persons are
required to make specific financial commitments. Therefore, the variable compensation components of the
Short Term Incentive (STI) and the Long Term Incentive (LTI) of an eligible person will be paid in SARs.

Each SAR entitles the relevant participant to share in the value increase of the shares up to the vesting
date. The value increase is measured as the difference between the base enterprise value of T-Mobile
and the enterprise value at the vesting date for two schemes (I and II).

The general scheme set-up (scheme I) is as follows. There are two classes of SARs:

(a) SARs in Class A, which relate to a Value Creation up to and including a certain value threshold
amount (“A SARs”); and

(b) SARs in Class B, which relate to a value creation in excess over the threshold amount (“B SARs”).

A SARs and B SARs are granted, are allocated and vest in pairs (“SAR Pairs”). The ratio between
outstanding A SARs and B SARs are at all times 1:1. The total number of SAR pairs available to be
granted under the scheme is 10,000,000 (the “SAR pool”).

The SARs under scheme II are designated as C SARs. The total number of C SARs available to be
granted under the scheme is 500,000.

The vesting will entitle the participant to the SAR cash-out amount at the vesting date, which is the
earlier of the end date of the SAR scheme being 31 December 2021 or another exit event. The
cash-out payment is calculated as the percentage of the employee’s SAR pairs represent in the total
number of vesting SAR pairs multiplied by the amount Vesting Value.

The Vesting Value calculates as the sum of the amount becoming available on all Vesting A SARs,
being an amount equal to 8% of the Value Creation up to and including the Value Creation of the
threshold amount and the amount becoming available on all Vesting B SARs, being an amount equal
to 6% of the Value Creation in excess of the threshold amount. The vesting value of Vesting C SARs is
an amount equal to 4% of the Value Creation.

The Value Creation is determined as an amount equal to the equity value of 100% of the Shares at the
Vesting Date (the “Realization Value (100%)”) minus the aggregate of the Base Equity Value (plus the
Net FCF Adjustment and minus Transaction Costs), whereby the Realization Value (100%) will be
determined by an Independent Appraiser, based on customary valuation principles.

The number of shares granted in financial year 2020 related to scheme II is 409,580.

The program is measured at fair value on each reporting date and recognized as expense over the
related service period. The fair value of SARs thereby is based on the fair value of T-Mobile on the
date of grant, determined by an Independent Appraiser. The fair value of SAR scheme rights as at
31 December 2020 SARs was calculated applying a probability weighted scenario analysis to
determine the fair value of the SAR scheme rights as at 31 December 2020. Given that the pay-out
under the SAR scheme is dependent on the future equity value of T-Mobile, the equity value was
estimated over time using a Binomial Tree. The probability of each pay-off is estimated and multiplied
by its respective outcome to derive a weighted average of the final payout value. Based on the
procedures performed, the valuation arrived at a total SAR scheme value as per the valuation date of
EUR 46.0 million for scheme I and EUR 12.7 million for scheme II. The total book value of the liability
amounts to EUR 34.6 million for scheme I and EUR 5.1 million for scheme II. Stock-based
compensation expense was EUR 15.92 million as of 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: EUR
11.88 million).

**32.** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT**

This note covers financial instruments and risk management. For further information on financial
instruments, please refer in particular to Note 4 Trade and other receivables, Note 7 Other assets,
Note 12 Financial liabilities and lease liabilities, Note 13 Trade and other payables, and Note 15
Contract liabilities.

**OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES**

The Group’s principal financial assets comprise of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and
receivables due from related parties. The Group’s principal financial liabilities consist of trade payables
and payables due to related parties.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk (including currency risk
and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

There have been no changes in the objectives, policies and processes for managing and measuring
risk compared to the previous year.

**MARKET RISK**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
indexation (especially for lease contracts, see Note 12 of the financial statements) will affect the
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters. The
Group faces a low market risk regarding financial instruments. There are no significant price risks at
the reporting date.

-----

**FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT**

The Group mainly derives its revenues from its operations in the Netherlands and for some part by
generating roaming revenues for mobile traffic outside the Netherlands. Based on a risk analysis, the
Group determined that it is exposed to minimal currency risk as most of the transactions are
denominated in euros. The remaining risk for volatility of exchange rates is not material. No positions
are hedged.

**CREDIT RISK**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables
from customers. The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group’s
clients primarily consist of consumers and businesses with low average balances which are regularly
reviewed. When necessary, these consumers are disconnected from service when no payment is
received. Credit risk is taken into account through a combination of specific and general valuation
allowances. Several debt collection agencies are commissioned to collect outstanding receivables and
inform the Group about the status of doubtful debts. This valuation is done by the agencies based on
complex models taking various indications into account.

For further information please also refer to the Note “Transfer of assets (factoring of receivables)” down
below.

As at 31 December 2020, the gross amount of the trade receivables is EUR 585.7 million
(31 December 2019: EUR 624.6 million). Credit loss allowances of EUR 95.5 million (31 December
2019: EUR 85.8 million) are recognized based on probability weighting of multiple scenarios including
forward looking information. .

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped
based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to
unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables
for the same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for
trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 12 to 45 months,
depending on the segment, and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this
period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on
macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

The Group exercises considerable judgement in the classification of their in-house cash pool balances
as cash equivalents. These in-house cash pool balances are managed within the Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTAG) Group treasury function. The DTAG Group treasury function operates as an in-house bank
which has similar characteristics as a regular bank. It maintains sufficient cash and liquid resources,
along with access to credit lines, to meet all intercompany obligations simultaneously. With respect to
DTAG’s liquidity risk, DTAG has met its targets for the liquidity reserve to cover at least the maturities
for the next 24 months in both 2020 and 2019. Deutsche Telekom had standardized bilateral credit
agreements with 21 banks a total of EUR 12.6 billion as of 31 December 2020. As of 31 December
2019, EUR 0.6 billion of these credit lines had been utilized and during 2020 no credit lines had been
utilized. The DTAG central treasury department is responsible for the coordination of all intragroup
cash and payment flows. The internal control processes and procedures from the DTAG central
treasury department are implemented and monitored according to the minimum requirements set by
the German Financial Market Authority, where applicable. The DTAG central treasury department
monitors the balances of all companies that are part of the central cash pooling and ensures sufficient
funding of the respective balances.

In addition, the Group has direct access to these cash pool accounts and is entitled to terminate the
cash pooling agreement without notice for good reason.

Management have therefore assessed that these balances are highly liquid instruments that are also
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

As at 31 December 2020, the Group’s maximum credit risk can be depicted as follows:

Credit risk for each class of financial assets, taking collateral held and other loan collateral into
account.

Contract assets (IFRS 15) AC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22,344 28,009

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk from fair value at profit or loss at 31 December 2020 and
31 December 2019 is equal to the carrying amounts.

**INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT**

Changes in the market interest rate could have an impact on the carrying amount of financial
instruments carried at fair value. However, this variability is not managed, as this risk is limited due to
the short-term character of the concerning instruments.

Changes in the market interest rates of financial instruments with fixed interest rates only affect income
if these are measured at their fair value.

The Group has two fixed interest group loan facilities. These loans are carried at amortized cost and
are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined in IFRS 7. As per December 31, 2020 the fixed
interest rate is 4.25% for the loan granted in 2018 and 1.64% for the loan drawn in the current year.
Future refinancing might lead to a different interest rate. For the three factoring agreements the Group
is exposed to variable interest rates of 1month Euribor plus a fixed margin of 95bps. Given the current
negative Euribor interest rates and the expected developments in the market interest, the Group does
not have measures in place as the risk is considered to be low.

-----

**LIQUIDITY RISK**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet financial obligations as they fall due. The
Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group manages its liquidity risks by using Deutsche Telekom AG companies to secure financing.
If necessary, further funding is provided by the Group’s finance companies. In Note 12 the outstanding
loan payable with Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V. and GTS Central European Holding B.V. are
disclosed.

As per 31 December 2020 two long-term loans, which mature on December 2023 respectively
November 2026, are shown in the statement of financial position. For further details see Note 12
Financial liabilities and Note 13 Trade payables.

**CAPITAL MANAGEMENT**

The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain shareholder, creditors and
market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Group’s objectives when
managing capital are:

    - to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to
provide returns for its shareholder and benefits for another stakeholder, and

    - to provide an adequate return to its shareholder by pricing products and services
commensurately with the level of risk.

The net debt increased by an amount of EUR 197,044 thousand to EUR 1,997,367 thousand. As of
31 December 2020, the total lease liability amounts to EUR 790,917 thousand mainly resulting from
the lease commitments with T-Infra B.V. and other recognized leases. The decrease in the lease
liabilities is mainly the result of principal repayments of leases, an early termination of an office building
lease contract and the dismantling of Tele2 sites.

The movement in cash and cash equivalents is due to cash flows resulting from normal business
activities. The movement in the lease liabilities is due to cash outflow of lease payments (EUR 148
million) and accretion of interest (EUR 44 million). The new leases, i.e. leases resulting from the
acquisition of Simpel and contract changes, do not affect cash flows. The movement in the financial
liabilities is due to a new shareholder loan received for the acquisition of Simpel, the repayment of the
shareholder loan and factoring.

**DISCLOSURES ON FAIR VALUE**

When determining the fair value, it is important to maximize the use of current inputs observable in
liquid markets for the financial instrument in question and minimize the use of other inputs
(e.g. historical prices, prices for similar instruments, prices on illiquid markets). A three-level
measurement hierarchy is defined for these purposes. If prices quoted in liquid markets are available at
the reporting date for the respective financial instrument, these will be used unadjusted for the
measurement (Level 1 measurement). Other input parameters are then irrelevant for the
measurement.

If quoted prices on liquid markets are not available at the reporting date for the respective financial
instrument, but the instrument can be measured using other inputs that are observable on the market
at the reporting date, a Level 2 measurement will be applied. The conditions for this are that no major
adjustments have been made to the observable inputs and no unobservable inputs are used.

If the conditions for a Level 1 or Level 2 measurement are not met, a Level 3 measurement is applied.
In such cases, major adjustments must be made to the observable inputs or unobservable inputs must
be used.

**FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE**

For the trade receivables, assigned to Level 3, which are measured either at fair value through profit
and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income, the main factor in determining fair value is
the credit risk of the relevant counterparties. If the default rates apply as of the reporting date had been
1% higher (lower) with no change in the reference variables, the fair values of the instruments would
have been 1% lower (higher). Following the prudence concept, recoveries of defaulted receivables are
not taken into account. Allowances on trade receivables that are classified as debt instruments
measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive
income are reported under other operating expenses.

The fair value of the financial instruments accounted for at amortized costs approximates their carrying
value as the interest rate risks is considered to be minimal given the low interest rate in the European
Union and limited changes in the interest rates, e.g. for financial instruments such as short-term trade
receivables and payables For these instruments no fair value is disclosed.

Liabilities to banks are mostly short-term nature, respectively have a variable interest rate. Therefore,
the fair value of liabilities to banks approximates the book value. The interest rate as the main input
factor for the fair value is observable at the market and therefore level 2 of the fair value hierarchy
applies.

The fair value of the amounts due to group companies mainly consists of the loan from DT Europe B.V.
and GTS Central Europe Holding B.V. amounting to a book value of EUR 1,354,000 thousand (2019:
EUR 1,083,319 thousand). The fair value of these loans per 31 December 2020 is EUR
1,509,598 thousand (2019: EUR 1,236,694 thousand) and is calculated as the present values of the
payments associated with the debt, based on the applicable yield curve and credit spread curve. The
remaining amount represents current accounts payable to group companies of which the fair value
equals the book value.

**TRANSFER OF ASSETS (FACTORING OF RECEIVABLES)**

T-Mobile is party to factoring agreements under which it sells trade receivables on a revolving basis.
The receivables are sold on a daily basis or quarterly basis and settled on a monthly basis. The
receivables sold entail both telecom charges already due and charges from sales of handsets payable
over a period of up to two years. The debtors are consumers as well as business customers. In none of
the transactions is T-Mobile exposed to risks other than the credit risk and late-payment risk resulting
from the sold receivables agreed in the respective agreement. The terms of the agreements end
between 2021 and 2023. The factoring transactions involve (a) the transfer of substantially all risks and
rewards with the involvement of structured entities, (b) the splitting of significant risks and rewards with
control remaining at T-Mobile without the involvement of structured entities and (c) the factoring
agreements involve the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining at T-Mobile with
the involvement of structured entities.

**(a) Factoring transactions with substantially all risks and rewards being transferred with the**
**involvement of structured entities.**

A factoring agreement is in place with a maximum program volume of EUR 95 million. If the buyer
agrees to purchase receivables beyond this amount, the purchase price payment shall be deferred
until the maximum program volume decreases again by the corresponding amount. With this structure,
there is no structured entity consolidated by T-Mobile. Rather, the receivables are sold directly to a
structured entity that is not consolidated by T-Mobile due to the lack of ability to direct the entity’s
relevant activities. This structured entity holds the receivables and allocates the risks and rewards
resulting from these to T-Mobile and a bank on the basis of contractual arrangements.

The structured entity is financed through the issue of commercial paper to third parties outside
T-Mobile or, alternatively, through a credit facility provided by a bank. The structured entity has the
freedom to decide whether and which receivables will be purchased, though purchase of the agreed
minimum volume is imperative. T-Mobile is obligated to buy back aged receivables and receivables for
which a write-down is imminent at nominal value. The cash flows resulting from the buybacks would
occur in the month following the buyback. Such buybacks of receivables would not affect the allocation
of the credit risk-related losses in any way, as the latter would be passed back to the buyers in line with
the agreed risk allocation. The nominal volume of the receivables sold by T-Mobile and not yet settled
by the debtors was EUR 69.7 million (2019: EUR 72,1) as of the reporting date. The structured entity
has no other business activities than the purchase or sale of trade receivables or other investments.

The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the sold receivables are based on the credit
risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). As of reporting date the credit risk represents
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables and is transferred in full to the
buyer. The maximum credit risk to be borne by T-Mobile in a worst-case scenario amounts to EUR
3.5 million (2019: EUR 4.0 million) as of the reporting date. The other credit risk-related losses would
be borne by the buyer. The late-payment risk continues to be borne in full by T-Mobile. The maximum
exposure to loss for T-Mobile resulting from credit risk and late-payment risk relating to the receivables
sold at the reporting date is EUR 3.5 million (2019: EUR 4.0 million). According to the risk assessment
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables were transferred to the buyer as
of reporting date. The expected loss resulting from the late-payment risk recognized under financial
liabilities represents T-Mobile’s entire continuing involvement; the carrying amount and fair value each
amounted to less than EUR 100 thousand. In 2019 the agreement was reported as a factoring
transaction involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards, according to the then risk
assessment, with control remaining at T-Mobile. The accounting treatment changed in 2020 due to an
increase of credit risk transferred.

T-Mobile continues to perform servicing for the receivables sold. Under the factoring agreement the
buyer (structured entity) has the right to transfer the servicing to third parties for no specific reason.
Although T-Mobile is not authorized to use the receivables sold other than in its capacity as servicer, it
retains control over the receivables sold because the buyers and the structured entities do not have the
practical ability to resell the purchased receivables. At the time the receivables are sold, the fair value
of the expected losses is expensed. In the transaction with a structured entity, certain portions of the

F-82


-----

purchase price are initially held back and, depending on the amount of the actual defaults, are only
paid to T-Mobile at a later date. To the extent that such portions of the purchase price are expected to
be received in the future, they are recognized at fair value. T-Mobile presents the purchase price
payments received from the buyers under cash generated from operations where these relate to the
derecognized portion of the receivables, and under net cash from/used in financing activities where
they relate to the portion of the receivables that is still recognized. The volume of receivables sold was
not subject to major fluctuations since the beginning of the respective transaction.

In 2020 T-Mobile expensed EUR 0.7 million, including credit-risk discounts to cover monthly credit risks
and including program fees (interest and bank margin), and has expensed a total amount of EUR
6.5 million since the beginning of the transaction.

**(b) Factoring transactions involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control**
**remaining at T-Mobile without the involvement of structured entities.**

A factoring transaction is in place under which a bank is required to purchase trade receivables. The
receivables sold entail charges from sales of handsets payable over a period of up to two years. The
factoring agreement has a maximum funding amount of EUR 90 million. The purchase price will be
paid out immediately upon sale. On 5 December 2019, the term of this factoring transaction has been
extended for another two (2) years to 30 June 2021. In 2019 the transaction was reported as a
factoring agreement involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control transferred to the
buyers resulting in a full derecognition of receivables sold. In a regular review process of the
derecognition requirements in 2020 T-Mobile assessed that bank does not have the practical ability to
resell the receivables anymore and consequently T-Mobile remains control over the receivables.

The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the receivables sold are the credit risk and
the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). The purchase price corresponds to the nominal amount.
The maximum credit risk from the various tranches to be borne by T-Mobile amounts to EUR
14.3 million as of the reporting date (2019: EUR 14.4 million). The other credit risk-related losses are
borne by the buyer. The late-payment risk continues to be borne in full by T-Mobile. Substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables were neither transferred nor retained (allocation
of the material risks and rewards between T-Mobile and the buyers) as of reporting date.

T-Mobile continues to perform servicing for the receivables sold. Although T-Mobile is not authorized to
use the receivables sold other than in its capacity as servicer, it retains control over the receivables
sold because the buyer does not have the practical ability to resell the purchased receivables. At the
time the receivables are sold, the fair value of the expected losses is expensed. Expected future
payments are presented as a component of the associated liability. T-Mobile continues to recognize
the trade receivables sold to the extent of its continuing involvement, i.e. in the maximum amount with
which it is still liable for the credit risk and late-payment risk inherent in the receivables sold, and
recognizes a corresponding associated liability presented in liabilities to banks.

The receivables and the associated liability are then derecognized in the extent to which T-Mobile’s
continuing involvement is reduced (particularly when payment is made by the customer). The carrying
amount of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the extent to which the actual losses to be borne
by T-Mobile resulting from the credit risk and the late-payment risk exceed the losses initially expected.
This amount is recognized as an expense.

T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2020 amounted to EUR 14.4 million (2019: n/a),
and the carrying amount of the associated liability was EUR 14.4 million (2019: n/a). The outstanding
amount of receivables as per 31 December 2020 for this particular factoring transaction amounted to
EUR 60.7 million (2019: EUR 42.1 million). In 2020 T-Mobile expensed EUR 0.5 million, including
credit-risk discounts and loss allocations to cover monthly credit risks, in the financial year from its
continuing involvement including program fees (interest and bank margin), and has expensed a total
amount of EUR 5.6 million since the beginning of the transaction.

T-Mobile presents the purchase price payments received from the buyers under cash generated from
operations where these relate to the derecognized portion of the receivables, and under net cash

from/used in financing activities where they relate to the portion of the receivables that is still
recognized. The volume of receivables sold was not subject to major fluctuations since the beginning
of the respective transaction.

**(c) Factoring transactions involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control**
**remaining at T-Mobile with the involvement of structured entities.**

The factoring agreement has a maximum program volume of EUR 55 million. If the buyer agrees to
purchase receivables beyond this amount, the purchase price payment shall be deferred until the
maximum program volume decreases again by the corresponding amount. With this structure, there is
no structured entity consolidated by T-Mobile. Rather, the receivables are sold directly to a structured
entity that is not consolidated by T-Mobile due to the lack of ability to direct the entity’s relevant
activities. This structured entity holds the receivables and allocates the risks and rewards resulting
from these to T-Mobile and a bank on the basis of contractual arrangements.

The structured entity is financed through the issue of commercial paper to third parties outside
T-Mobile or, alternatively, through a credit facility provided by a bank. The receivables are purchased in
an automated process based on the purchase criteria set out in the receivables purchase agreement.
T-Mobile is obligated to buy back aged receivables and receivables for which a write-down is imminent
at nominal value. The cash flows resulting from the buybacks would occur in the month following the
buy-back. Such buybacks of receivables would not affect the allocation of the credit risk-related losses
in any way, as the latter would be passed back to the buyers in line with the agreed risk allocation. The
nominal volume of the receivables sold by T-Mobile and not yet settled by the debtors was EUR
46.0 million (2019: EUR 47.9 million) as of the reporting date. The structured entity has no other
business activities than the purchase or sale of trade receivables or other investments.

The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the sold receivables are based on the credit
risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). The maximum credit risk to be borne by T-Mobile
amounts to EUR 2.6 million (2019: EUR 2.7 million) as of the reporting date. The other credit riskrelated losses are borne by the buyers. The late-payment risk continues to be borne in full by T-Mobile.
The maximum exposure to loss for T-Mobile resulting from credit risk and late-payment risk relating to
the receivables sold at the reporting date is EUR 2.6 million (2019: EUR 2.7 million). Substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables were neither transferred nor retained (allocation
of the material risks and rewards between T-Mobile and the buyers).

T-Mobile continues to perform servicing for the receivables sold. Under the factoring agreement the
buyer (structured entity)has the right to transfer the servicing to third parties for no specific reason.
Although T-Mobile is not authorized to use the receivables sold other than in its capacity as servicer, it
retains control over the receivables sold because the buyers and the structured entities do not have the

of the expected losses is expensed. Expected future payments are presented as a component of the
associated liability. In transactions with structured entities, certain portions of the purchase price are

future, they are recognized at fair value. T-Mobile continues to recognize the trade receivables sold to
the extent of its continuing involvement, i.e. in the maximum amount with which it is still liable for the
credit risk and late-payment risk inherent in the receivables sold, and recognizes a corresponding
associated liability presented in liabilities to banks.

The receivables and the associated liability are then derecognized in the extent to which T-Mobile’s
continuing involvement is reduced (particularly when payment is made by the customer). The carrying
amount of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the extent to which the actual losses to be borne
by T-Mobile resulting from the credit risk and the late-payment risk exceed the losses initially expected.
This amount is recognized as an expense.

T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2020 amounted to EUR 2.6 million (2019: EUR
2.6 million), and the carrying amount of the associated liability was EUR 2.6 million (2019: EUR 2.7
million). T-Mobile presents the purchase price payments received from the buyers under cash

generated from operations where these relate to the derecognized portion of the receivables, and
under net cash from/used in financing activities where they relate to the portion of the receivables that
is still recognized. The volume of receivables sold was not subject to major fluctuations since the
beginning of the respective transaction.

In 2020 T-Mobile expensed EUR 0.7 million, including credit-risk discounts and loss allocations to
cover monthly credit risks, in the financial year from its continuing involvement including program fees
(interest and bank margin), and has expensed a total amount of EUR 7.8 million since the beginning of
the transaction.

A factoring transaction that was reported in 2019 as involving the splitting of significant risks and
rewards with control remaining at T-Mobile with the involvement of structured entities is now reported
as a factoring transaction with substantially all risks and rewards being transferred with the involvement
of structured entities. The accounting treatment changed in 2020 due to an increase of credit risk
transferred.

**FINANCIAL COVENANTS**

The Company’s factoring agreements are subject to financial covenants. For two factoring agreements
the financial covenant consist of the tangible net worth ratio based on the audited annual consolidated
financial statements. The tangible net worth ratio shall be equal to or greater than 0.18 with the
tangible net worth being equal or greater than EUR 500 million. The tangible net worth ratio is
calculated as follows (A) divided by (B) whereas (A) is tangible net worth and (B) is balance sheet total.
Tangible net worth means share capital plus reserves (including retained earnings) plus minority
interests minus (plus (if a negative figure)) cash flow hedge reserve minus intangible assets (excluding
licenses). The balance sheet total means balance sheet total minus (plus (if a negative figure)) cash
flow hedge reserve) minus intangible assets (excluding licenses). Based on the audited annual
consolidated financial statements the tangible net worth ratio amounted to 0.16 in 2020 (2019: 0.21).

The tangible net worth amounted to EUR 591 million (2019: EUR 841 million). The financial covenant
(tangible net worth ratio) is not met at balance sheet date, but as according to the clauses of the
factoring agreement, since the ratio improved within 5 working days after balance sheet date, there is
no breach of the financial covenant. On 1 January 2021, the result of the year (EUR 175 million) is
transferred to the retained earnings, resulting into a ratio of 0.21 and a tangible net worth of EUR
766 million. Consequently, the financial covenant for the respective factoring agreements have been
met for 2020 and 2019.

For another factoring agreement a different set of financial covenant applies. The financial covenant of
this factoring agreement is based on the Company’s unaudited quarterly financial statements for DT
group reporting purposes. The financial covenant is reported to the respective bank on a quarterly
basis.

The financial covenant for this factoring agreement consists of:

The intra-group funding is at least EUR 300 million,

The equity ratio may not fall below 20%, and

The leverage factor may not exceed 4.0.

The Company has met the financial covenant for all quarters during 2020 and 2019.

**35.** **SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

On 6 September 2021, Funds advised by Warburg Pincus LLC (“Warburg Pincus”) and Funds advised
by Apax Partners LLP (“Apax”), have agreed to acquire T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V from
Deutsche Telekom AG and Tele2 AB. The transaction values the company at an enterprise value of
EUR 5.1bn. The deal is subject to approval from regulatory bodies and finalization of the consultation
process with the Works Council.

On 6 September 2021, DT Europe B.V., Tele2 Sverige AB and T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V.
have signed a settlement agreement to terminate the rights and obligations for each of the parties
under the SPA concluded in February 2018. This includes, but is not limited to, indemnities for certain
claims that existed on the signing date. Some of the indemnities will be continued under the SPA
concluded on 6 September 2021 with the contemplated new owners of T-Mobile Netherlands Holdings
B.V.

On 1 April 2021, the Group signed a long-term agreement to become an anchor tenant on the fiber
network to be rolled out by Open Dutch Fiber, a newly established company owner by investment
funds KKR and DTCP.(hereafter ‘MSA’). As per this agreement, the Group commits to a long-term
agreement to utilize the fiber Infrastructure and warrant a minimum set of payments to the lessor. The
MSA only provides a framework / general terms for the Cluster Agreements (CA) that T-Mobile will
conclude with the lessor. The CAs set out the details per cluster (area) such as object, commencement
date, cluster specifics, charges and payments.

Pursuant to the provisions of the MSA/CA, the initial lease term begins on the date on which the
relevant cluster is ready for service. Hence, the Group commits to lease the fiber Infrastructure within a
cluster and commit to a minimum usage to the lessor as per the date that the subcluster is ready for
service. As per the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue, no subclusters are
ready for service, which entails that the Group does not yet have a financial commitment, however
subclusters will be delivered during the course of 2021 and beyond, which will have a material impact
on the financial statements. The Group expects the first subcluster to be ready for service by the end
of September 2021.

In 2018, a Dutch governmental Taskforce started a risk assessment on 5G security. November 2019
”Besluit veiligheid en integriteit telecommunicatie”—AMVB is established. In April 2021 T-Mobile
received an individual classified decision stating which components should be of a trusted vendor. A
transition period is granted. The Group will use this transition period to replace the concerning
components.

The estimated investment required to replace the concerning components and is included in business
plans. Since the beginning of 2019 US regulation has impacted the supply chain for spare parts and
execution of services. Actions have been established to ensure continuity both on a spare part level
and to bring the execution of services in line with the US regulation.

### The basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on
Auditing. We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section
‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

### Independence
We are independent of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. in accordance with the ‘Wet toezicht
accountantsorganisaties’ (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the ‘Verordening inzake de
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant
independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the
‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).

## Report on the other information included in the annual report

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report
contains other information that consists of:

- the management board report;

- the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information:

- is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements;

- contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our
audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information
contains material misstatements.

By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch
Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was substantially less than
the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

The board of management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including
the management board report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of
the Dutch Civil Code.

## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

### Responsibilities of the board of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements
The board of management is responsible for:

- the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for

- such internal control as the board of management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board of management is responsible
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial
reporting frameworks mentioned, the board of management should prepare the financial
statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of management either
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do
so. The board of management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

### Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to
obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our objectives
are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance, which
makes it possible that we may not detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise
due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
the financial statements.

Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the
effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.

## Appendix to our auditor’s report on the financial statements 2020 of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V.

In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report, we have further set out in this appendix
our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.

### The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism
throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and
independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:

- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.

- Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

- Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of management.

- Concluding on the appropriateness of the board of management’s use of the going concern
basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a
material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date
of our auditor’s report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial
statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to
cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements,
we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this
context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the
Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial
statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the
significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and
controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities
for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered
necessary.

We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

**1.2.1 CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE GROUP**

In the financial year 2019, the Group conducted the following transaction, which had an impact on the
composition of the Group:

**ACQUISITION OF TELE2 NETHERLANDS HOLDING N.V.**

On December 15, 2017, Deutsche Telekom signed an agreement with the Tele2 Group on the acquisition
of 100 percent of the shares in the telecommunications provider Tele2 Netherlands Holding N.V. (hereafter:
‘Tele2 Netherlands’) by T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. (hereafter: ‘T-Mobile Netherlands’). After the
European Commission issued its approval without conditions on November 27, 2018, the transaction was
consummated on January 2, 2019. Tele2 Netherlands has been included in T-Mobile Netherlands’s
consolidated financial statements as a fully consolidated subsidiary since the acquisition date. The enlarged
company continues to operate as T- Mobile Netherlands and will also use the Tele2 brand name in the
Dutch telecom market. This transaction will establish a stronger, more sustainable provider of convergent
fixed network and mobile services on the Dutch market. The revenue and profit and loss of the acquiree are
since the acquisition date included in the consolidated financial statement of comprehensive income in the
reporting period. As the technical merger is realized within the ERP system under the same company code
together with T-Mobile Netherlands it is technically impracticable to separate these data.

Tele2 Sverige AB received a purchase price in the form of a 25 percent stake in T-Mobile Netherlands
and a cash component of EUR 199 million. Deutsche Telekom maintains 75% of the shares in
T-Mobile Netherlands.

The purchase price allocation and the measurement of Tele2 Netherlands’ assets and liabilities at the
acquisition date were finalized as of December 31, 2019. The cash consideration transferred amounts
to EUR 199 million plus the stake of Tele2 Sverige AB of 25% in T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V.
valued at EUR 759 million (in total EUR 958 million). The purchase consideration for the acquisition of
the Tele2 business was calculated based on the business plan of the enlarged company, applying the
discounted cash flow (DCF) method, and taking synergies into account. Synergies in the business plan
included direct costs synergies attributable to the fixed part of the business, market invest synergies
attributable to the mobile part of the business, and operating expenditures synergies include synergies
related to all categories, i.e. workforce, network, marketing, and other costs. All synergies were
assumed to be available to an average market participant. Acquisition related costs amounting to EUR
1.6M were expensed as incurred in the financial year 2019 (2018: EUR 0.6M) and disclosed in the
consolidated income statement within the other operating expenses.

The fair values of Tele2 Netherlands’ acquired assets and liabilities recognized at the acquisition date
are presented in the following table:

The fair value of acquired trade receivables is EUR 236 million. The gross contractual amount for trade
receivables due before purchase price allocation was EUR 233 million, with a fair value step-up of EUR
5 million recognized on acquisition and a settlement purchase price adjustment of EUR -2 million.

The acquired goodwill of EUR 109 million reflects the value of expected synergies arising from the
acquisition, expected new customer gains, and the value of the assembled workforce. A deferred tax
liability was recognized against the statutory tax rate of 25% in relation to the fair value adjustments in
value of the identified assets and liabilities to acknowledge the difference in reporting for commercial
and fiscal purposes.

The goodwill is calculated as follows:

**Gross goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **124**

The goodwill reflects the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition, expected new
customer gains, and the value of the assembled workforce. The spectrum licenses were measured
using the guideline transaction method, with the fair value being derived based on the price analyses
used in spectrum auctions carried out in the European telecommunications industry. The spectrum
licenses are amortized over the expected useful life of 10 to 11 years. The customer base was
measured using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, the fair value of the
customer base is determined by calculating the present value of profit/ loss after taxes that can be
assigned to the existing customers. The customer base is amortized over the remaining useful life of 5
to 15 years. The carrying amounts of the acquired receivables are based on the fair values. The gross
amounts of the receivables amount to EUR 279 million. No material contingent liabilities have been
identified. The deferred tax assets relate to Tele2 Netherlands’ loss carryforwards. The deferred tax
liabilities comprise the tax effect on the temporary differences between the fair value of the different
assets and liabilities on the one hand, and the respective carrying amount for tax purposes on the
other. No material transaction-based costs were incurred by December 31, 2019.

**1.2.2 DISTRIBUTION OF T-MOBILE INFRA B.V. TO OWNERS BY DIVIDEND IN KIND**

T-Mobile decided to demerge part of its passive equipment and part of its rented sites to a separate
legal entity. T-Infra B.V. has been established on 1 September 2018 via legal demerger as a subsidiary
of T-Mobile Netherlands B.V. Active network equipment was not part of the demerger. As per
1 January 2019, Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V. acquired 100% of the shares of T-Infra B.V. through a
dividend in kind. Consequently, T-Mobile derecognized the assets and liabilities of the former
subsidiary from the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group will continue to purchase
services from T-Infra B.V.

**2.** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

**2.1** **GENERAL**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group comply, in all material respects, with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU): IFRS
-EU, as well as with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and give a true
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in thousands of euro. The financial year
corresponds to the calendar year. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under
the historical cost basis unless otherwise stated.

With reference to the company’s income statement, use has been made of the exemption pursuant to
Section 402 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

**2.2** **CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES**

With the exception of the standards, interpretation and amendments that are effective for the first time
in the financial year (see paragraph 2.4), the Group did not make changes in its accounting policies.

**2.3** **COMPARATIVE FIGURES**

The figures of the financial year 2019 include the figures from Tele2 resulting from the business
combination beginning of the year (please refer to section 1.2.1 Changes in the composition of the
Group Acquisition of Tele2 Netherlands Holding N.V.). The Company has restated the classification of
the other receivables to trade receivables for the amount of EUR 619K, other payables to current other
liabilities for the amount of 68,947k, non current other liabilities to other payables for the amount of
2,004k, other receivables to other assets for the amount of 32,629k and tax liabilities to liabilities held
for sale for the amount of 1,792k.

The above restatements do not have any impact on the reported profit for the year or reported equity
and an immaterial impact on the cash flow statement.

**2.4** **NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP**

In the 2019 financial year, T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. applied the following IASB
pronouncements and/or amendments to such pronouncements for the first time:


**Pronouncement** **Title**


**To be applied**
**from** **Changes**


IFRS 16 Leases 1 January IFRS 16 principally requires
2019 lessees to recognize assets
and liabilities for all leases
and the rights and
obligations associated with
these leases in the
statement of financial
position. Going forward,
lessees will therefore no
longer be required to make
the distinction between
finance and operating
leases that was required in
the past in accordance with
IAS 17. For all leases, the
lessee will recognize a lease
liability in its statement of
financial position for the
obligation to make future
lease payments. At the
same time, the lessee will
capitalize a right of use to
the underlying asset which
is equivalent to the present
value of the future lease
payments plus initial direct
costs, directly attributable
expenditure, advance
payments and restoration
costs, as well as less
incentive payments
received. Similar to the
guidance on finance leases
in IAS 17, the lease liability
will be adjusted over the
lease term for any
remeasurement, while the
right-of-use asset will be
depreciated, which in
contrast to the current lease
expense normally leads to
higher expenses at the
inception date of a lease.
For the lessor, on the other
hand, the provisions of the
new standard are similar to
the existing guidance in IAS
17. IFRS 16 also includes
new provisions on the
definition of a lease and its
presentation, on disclosures
in the notes, and on sale
and leaseback transactions.

met, financial assets can be
measured at amortized cost
or fair value through other
comprehensive income if, in
the case of an early
termination, compensation
is required to be paid to the
party that triggers the early
termination of the contract.

2019 an entity applies IFRS 9
including its impairment
requirements to long-term
interests in an associate or
joint venture that form part
of the net investment in the
associate or joint venture
but are not accounted for
using the equity method.

1 January The guidance on the
2019 amendment, curtailment, or
settlement of a defined
benefit pension plan has
been changed as follows:

Clarification that an entity
is required to determine
current service cost and the
net interest for the
remainder of the reporting
period after a plan
amendment, curtailment, or
settlement using updated
actuarial assumptions and
the net liability (or net asset)
at the time of the
intervention.

Any changes in a surplus
must be recognized as profit
or loss as part of past
service cost, or a gain or
loss on settlement, even if
this surplus had not been
previously disclosed due to
the effect of the asset
ceiling.

The effects of changes
in the asset ceiling are
recognized in other
comprehensive income.

1 January Clarification of many No material impact.
2019 published standards.


The Group applied for the first time the new IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ accounting standard as well as certain
amendments to the standards, which are effective on 1 January 2019. The Group has not early
adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.
The nature and the impact of the amendments that have a material impact on the presentation of the
Group’s result of operations and financial positions are disclosed in this section below.

The IFRS 16 standard is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019.
IFRS 16 has a material effect on T-Mobile’s consolidated financial statements, particularly on total
assets, the results of operations, cash generated from operations, net cash from/used for financing
activities, and the presentation of the financial position.

The new regulations affect T-Mobile as a lessee especially in relation to leases of cell sites (land,
space in cell towers, or rooftop surface areas), network infrastructure, and buildings used for
administrative or technical purposes. T-Mobile has not applied the new lease standard retrospectively
in the transition to IFRS 16 and therefore applied the modified retrospective method.

The new standard requires payment obligations from existing operating leases to be discounted and
recognized as lease liabilities; as financial liabilities, they increase net debt. At the same time, the
lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset. Operating expenses previously recognized in connection with
operating leases are now recognized in depreciation charges on right-of-use assets and in interest
expenses for discounted obligations from operating leases, as appropriate. This significantly increases
EBITDA without any attendant change in the economic circumstances. In the statement of cash flows,
the principal repayment portion of the lease payments from existing operating leases reduces net cash
from/used in financing activities and no longer affects net cash from operating activities. The interest
portion of the payments remains in net cash from operating activities and thus also in free cash flow.

The Group has not applied the new lease standard retrospectively in full, but makes use of the
exemption provisions for lessees, also known as the modified retrospective method. On the transition
to IFRS 16, remaining payment obligations from existing operating leases are discounted using the
relevant incremental borrowing rate and recognized as a lease liability and the right-of-use assets were
carried as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid
or accrued lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the
lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the
lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay
to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The incremental borrowing rate of
interest is determined by deriving benchmark interest rates for a period of up to 30 years from maturityrelated risk-free interest rates which are increased by a credit-risk premium and adjusted for a liquidity
and country-risk premium and also adjusted for the security related premium. Weighted average
incremental borrowing rates of 1.1 to 3.5 percent were applied to lease liabilities recognized in the
statement of financial position as of 1 January 2019. For the lease liabilities related to the master lease
agreement with T-Mobile Infra B.V., the rate implicit in the lease is 8.5 percent.

-----

In the statement of cash flows, the repayment portion of the lease payments from existing operating
leases will reduce net cash from/used in financing activities and no longer affect net cash from
operating activities. Only the interest payments will remain in net cash from operating activities,

By applying the modified retrospective approach practical expedients are exercised as follows:

    - The recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements of IFRS 16 also applied to shortterm leases and leases of low value assets;

    - Existing contracts will not be grandfathered. On January 1, 2019, IFRS 16 was therefore
applied to all existing leases falling within its scope. It applies to contracts in which T-Mobile is
a lessee;

    - A single discount rate is applied to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;

    - Non-lease components are generally not separated from lease components; instead, each
lease component and any associated non-lease components is accounted for as a single
lease component. This principle does not include contracts relating to data centers, which due
to their special requirements in terms of equipment and premises form their own separate
class of underlying asset. For this class of underlying assets, the non-lease payments are
recognized as an expense;

    - IAS 37 is applied immediately before the date of initial application for onerous leases;

    - Initial direct costs are excluded from the measurement of the right of use asset at the date of
initial application;

    - Provisions for onerous contracts recognized in connection with leases were adjusted against
the right-of-use asset as of January 1, 2019;

    - In determining the lease term, hindsight may be used where economic considerations and
penalties indicate that it is reasonably certain that options to extend or terminate the lease will
be exercised.

In addition, on the date of first-time adoption of IFRS 16 use was made of the main policy elections as
follows:

    - Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented separately in the statement of financial
position;

    - IAS 38 is applied for leases of intangible assets rather than IFRS 16.

The Group is not required to make any adjustments on transition to IFRS 16 for leases in which it acts
as a lessor, except for a sub-lease. T-Mobile assessed the classification of the sub-lease contracts with
reference to the right-of-use asset and concluded that they are finance leases under IFRS 16.

The finance leases relate to the sublease of sites. T-Mobile is a party to framework site sharing
agreements. The framework site sharing agreements are reciprocal and set for an indefinite time
period. Parties to the framework site sharing agreements need the space on the other parties’ sites
whereby the reciprocity ascertains that parties will make their sites available to the other party. As per
1 September 2018, the sites subject to the framework site sharing agreements were demerged to
T-Mobile Infra B.V. As per 1 September 2018, T-Mobile and T-Mobile Infra concluded a master lease
agreement for a minimum period of 15 years whereby T-Mobile leases the passive infrastructure and
space on T-Mobile Infra sites. T-Mobile remained principal to the framework site sharing agreements.

As at 1 January 2019, T-Mobile recognizes a receivable in the amount of the net investment in the
lease for a period of 15 years resulting from subleases related to above mentioned site sharing
agreements. The lease payments made by the lessees are split into an interest component and a
principal component. The rate implicit in these leases is 8.5%.

As at 1 January 2019, a net gain of EUR 21.8 million was recognized in equity as the difference
between the net investment in the lease of the amount of EUR 47.1 million and the carrying amount of
EUR 18.0 million of the relevant portion of the underlying assets net of deferred tax in the amount of
EUR 7.3 million.

-----

The adjustments made to the consolidated statement of financial position as of 1 January 2019 and
attributable to the first-time application of IFRS 16 are as follows:

    - The increase in right-of-use assets amounts to EUR 510.2 million.

    - Increase in the net investment of the lease amounting to EUR 47.1 million.

    - With relation to prepayments and accruals, right-of-use assets decreased by EUR 8.5 million
(Total right-of-use assets 501.7 million).

    - The increase in lease liabilities amounts to EUR 510.2 million.

    - The increase in lease liabilities leads to a corresponding increase in net debt.

    - The decrease in property, plant and equipment due to reclassification from finance leases
amounts to EUR 0.1 million.

The obligations arising from operating leases as of December 31, 2018 gave rise to the following
reconciliation to the opening balance of lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019:

The changes in the assessment of options to extend or terminate the lease amounting to EUR 297.6M
resulted from differences between the provisions under IAS 17 and IFRS 16 regarding to the
assessment date of the lease; T-Mobile was required to reassess existing lease agreements and to
make adjustments where differences were detected.

As per 1 September 2018, 3,139 sites were transferred from T-Mobile Netherlands B.V. to T-Mobile
Infra B.V. The respective lease liabilities were part of the operating leases as per 31 December 2018.
The lease liabilities in the amount of EUR 295.4 million were recognized as opening balance for the
IFRS 16 transition accounting. As per 1 January 2019 T-Mobile Infra was deconsolidated outside the
consolidation area of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V., resulting into a derecognition of the lease
liabilities of EUR 295.4 million. Instead T-Mobile has lease agreement with T-Mobile Infra B.V. for the
3,139 sites. This lease liability amounts to EUR 434.5 million as per 1 January 2019. The difference in
the amount (EUR 295.4 million) compared to the new lease liability (EUR 434.5 million) mainly results
from the fact that in addition to these sites the passive network equipment on these sites as well as
additional services are also agreed upon in the lease arrangement with T-Infra. Furthermore, the lease
arrangement with Infra also includes a mark-up for the transfer of the price risk on these sites and
equipment to Infra.

**2.5** **CONSOLIDATION METHODS**

**2.5.1 SUBSIDIARIES**

Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control only exists if
an investor has the power over the investee, is exposed to variable returns, and is able to use power to
affect its amount of variable returns. The existence and effect of substantive potential voting rights that
are currently exercisable or convertible, including potential voting rights held by other Group
companies, are considered when assessing whether an entity is controlled.

All subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. Income and expenses of a
subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. Income and
expenses of a subsidiary remain included in the consolidated financial statements until the date on
which the parent ceases to control the subsidiary. If necessary, the subsidiaries’ accounting principles
are aligned with the uniform accounting principles applied by the Group. Intercompany income and
expenses, receivables and liabilities, and profits or losses are eliminated.

Upon loss of control, a gain or loss from the disposal of the subsidiary is recognized in the consolidated
income statement in the amount of the difference between the (I) proceeds from the disposal of the
subsidiary, the fair value of the remaining shares, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests,
and the cumulative amounts of other comprehensive income attributable to the subsidiary, and (II) the
carrying amount of the subsidiary’s net assets to be disposed of.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies
are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.

F-111


-----

**2.5.2 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

A business combination exists when the Group obtains control of another entity. The acquisition
method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity
instruments or other assets are acquired. The cost of an acquired subsidiary is measured at the fair
value of the consideration transferred, comprising the:

   - the fair values of the assets transferred

   - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business

   - equity interest issued by the Group

   - fair value of any asset and liability resulting from contingent consideration arrangement, and

   - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary

The identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized in
full at their fair values at the acquisition date, regardless of the level of the investment held by the
Group. The Group recognized any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate
share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill arising in a business combination is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the cost of
acquisition, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and in a business combination
achieved in stages, the fair value of the equity interest held by T-Mobile in the acquiree prior to the
acquisition date over the fair value of the net assets acquired. If those amounts are less than the fair
value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognized directly in
profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. Any difference arising on the revaluation of equity interests
previously held by T-Mobile is recognized in profit or loss.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are
discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s
incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an
independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a
financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
profit or loss.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any
gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.

**_Common control acquisitions_**

A business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business
combination in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same
party or parties both before and after the business combination, and that control is not transitory. A
transaction deemed to be a transaction under common control consequently falls outside the scope of
IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The group’s accounting policy is to apply predecessor accounting to
common control transactions.

**2.6** **FOREIGN CURRENCIES**

**2.6.1 FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY**

The consolidated financial statements are denominated in euros, the functional and reporting currency
of the Group. Items included in the financial statements of group companies are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective group company operates (the
functional currency).

F-112


-----

**2.6.2 TRANSACTIONS, RECEIVABLES AND DEBTS**

Foreign-currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the
date of transaction. At the reporting date, monetary items are translated at the closing rate, and
non-monetary items are translated at the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Exchange rate
differences are recognized in profit or loss.

**2.7** **GOING CONCERN**

The management of the Group has assessed the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and is
satisfied that the Group has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, the Group is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubts
upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial
statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.

**2.8** **THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OUR BUSINESS**

The COVID-19 outbreak has developed rapidly in many countries in the world including the
Netherlands. The measures taken to contain the virus have affected the economic activities globally.
However, the consequences of the COVID-19 outspread and measures taken by the government have
not materially affected the supply and demand for the Company’s primary services. Therefore, its
operating results and cash flows from operations have not been negatively impacted subsequently,
and the company has sufficient liquidity. T-Mobile has taken several measures to limit the spread of
COVID-19 within the company. Retail shops were closed as from 16 March 2020 and reopened again
in June, taking into account necessary safety measures for our employees and customers. As of
15 December 2020, government has issued new measures to cope with COVID-19. Based on the new
measures T-Mobile has closed its shops. 40 shops will remain open for service activities only. The new
measures are in place until at least 19 January 2021. We have implemented a working from home
policy and enabled our employees to work from home in the best possible way. Our networks are
stable and can currently cope well with the additional volume caused by increased numbers of people
working from home.

Based on the facts and circumstances known at this moment and the possible scenarios about how the
COVID-19 virus and resulting government measures could evolve, management has determined that,
whilst uncertain, we do not believe, however, that the impact of the COVD-19 virus would have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.

For further reference, we refer to Note 37 ‘Subsequent events’.

**2.9** **SEGMENT REPORTING**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided, in
accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Segment Reporting’ to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) which is
the Board of Management of the Group. The Group identified three operating segments: Consumer,
Business and Other.

The Consumer segment offers fixed and mobile services (including handset sales) to the consumer.
The Business segment offers fixed and mobile services for entrepreneurs and enterprises. The
segment Other consists of costs related to the Group’s headquarters and other revenues such as
wholesale revenue.

**2.10** **JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES**

The presentation of the results of operations or financial position in the consolidated financial
statements is dependent upon and sensitive to assumptions, and estimates. The actual amounts may
differ from those estimates. The following critical accounting estimates and related assumptions and
uncertainties inherent in accounting policies applied are essential to understand the underlying
financial reporting risks and the effects that these accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties
may have on the consolidated financial statements.

F-113


-----

**2.10.1 IMPAIRMENTS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets involves the
use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause and timing of impairments, as well as the
determination of fair values. Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in
current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, increased
cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence,
discontinuance of services, current replacement costs, prices paid in comparable transactions, and
other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists.

The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows and the
determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant
judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows,
applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values. Specifically, the estimation of cash flows
underlying the fair values from the mobile business considers the continued investment in network
infrastructure required to generate future revenue growth through the offering of new data products and
services, for which only limited historical information on customer demand is available. If the demand
for these products and services does not materialize as expected, this would result in less revenue,
less cash flow, and potential impairment. When determining the fair values, additional planning
uncertainties are factored in that reflect the risks of macroeconomic development, which could
adversely affect future results of operations.

**2.10.2 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS**

Depreciation and amortization expenses are based on management estimates of useful life, residual
value and amortization method of property and equipment and intangible assets. Estimates may
change due to technological developments, competition, changes in market conditions and other
factors and may result in changes in the estimated useful life and in the amortization or depreciation
charges.

Technological developments are difficult to predict and our views on the trends and pace of
development may change over time. Some of the assets and technologies, in which the Group
invested several years ago, are still in use and provide the basis for new technologies. The useful lives
of property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed at least annually, taking into
consideration the factors mentioned above and all other relevant factors.

**2.10.3 DETERMINATION OF THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF A CASH-GENERATING UNIT**

The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates
by management. Methods used to calculate the recoverable amount include discounted cash flowbased methods and methods that use market prices as a basis. The measurements based on
discounted cash flows are founded on projections that are based on financial plans that have been
approved by management and are also used for internal purposes. The planning horizon selected
reflects the assumptions for short- to medium-term market developments and is selected to achieve a
steady state in the business outlook that is necessary for calculating the perpetual annuity.

This steady state is only reached based on the planning horizon selected, in particular due to the
sometimes long investment cycles in the telecommunications industry and the investments planned
and expected in the long run to acquire and extend the rights of spectrum use. Cash flows beyond the
internal mid-term planning are extrapolated using appropriate growth rates.

The key assumptions on which management has based its calculation of the recoverable amount
include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on
past experience as well as internal expectations, and that are underscored by external market data and
estimates: development of revenue, customer acquisition and retention costs, churn rates, capital
expenditure, market share, and growth rates. Discount rates are determined based on external figures
derived from the market, taking account of the risks associated with the cash-generating unit. Any
future changes in the aforementioned assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair values of
the cash-generating units.

F-114


-----

**2.10.4 Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets**

The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. To measure the
expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared
credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress
and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of
contracts. The group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a
reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.

**2.10.5 BUSINESS COMBINATION**

The purchase consideration for the business of Tele2 NL was calculated based on the business plan
provided by T Mobile’s management. The determination of the business plan for the enlarged company
involved the use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing, and amount of
future cash flows. It is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive
conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, increased cost of capital,
changes in the future availability of financing, technological developments, services, prices paid in
comparable transactions, The estimation of future cash flows require management to make significant
judgments. Specifically, the estimation of cash flows underlying the synergies demand assumptions
that reflect market participant perspectives. If those assumptions do not materialize as expected, this
would result in deviating cash flows.

**2.10.6 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS**

In order to determine the fair value of the SAR scheme per year end 2019, management had to make
assumption regarding the valuation of the equity of T-Mobile and the number of SAR to be vested
under the arrangement. The valuation method that has been applied for the determination of the equity
value was the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method. The financial forecast is the most important
input. It includes assumptions about revenue growth, EBITDA margin, capital expenditures, and cost of
equity and debt in particular. Furthermore, assumptions had to be made about certain vesting
scenarios under the arrangement and the numbers of SAR vesting, which particularly depends on the
estimated number of participants under the vesting scenarios.

**2.11** **JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The following are the critical judgments, apart from those involving estimations, that the Group has
made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant
effect on the amounts recognized in financial statements:

**2.11.1 JUDGMENT IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS**

The Group exercises considerable judgment in the classification of their in-house cash pool balances
as cash equivalents. These in-house cash pool balances are managed within the Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTAG) Group treasury function. The DTAG Group treasury function operates as an in-house bank
which has similar characteristics as a regular bank. It maintains sufficient cash and liquid resources,
along with access to credit lines, to meet all inter-company obligations simultaneously. With respect to
DTAG’s liquidity risk, DTAG has met its targets for the liquidity reserve to cover at least the maturities
for the next 24 months in both 2018 and 2019. Deutsche Telekom had standardized bilateral credit
agreements with 21 banks for a total of EUR 12.6 billion as of 31 December 2019. As of 31 December
2019, EUR 0.6 billion of these credit lines had been utilized. The internal control processes and
procedures from the DTAG central treasury department are implemented and monitored according to
the minimum requirements set by the German Financial Market Authority, where applicable. The DTAG
central treasury department monitors the balances of all companies that are part of the central cash
pooling and ensures sufficient funding of the respective balances.

In addition, the company has direct access to these cash pool accounts and is entitled to terminate the
cash pooling agreement without notice for good reason.

F-115


-----

Management have therefore assessed that these balances are highly liquid instruments that are also
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

**2.11.2 JUDGMENTS FOR THE RECOVERABILITY OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES**

In the Dutch tax jurisdiction in which the Group operates, management must make judgments for the
calculation of current and deferred taxes. This is relevant, for example, when it comes to a decision on
the recognition of deferred tax assets because it must be probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which the deductible temporary differences, loss carryforwards, and tax credits can be utilized.

In addition to the estimate of future earnings, various factors are used to assess the probability of the
future utilization of deferred tax assets, including past results of operations, the reliability of planning,
and tax planning strategies. The period used for the assessment of the recoverability depends on the
circumstances at the respective Group company and typically is in a range of 5 to 10 years.

**2.11.3 JUDGMENT IN MEASURING AND RECOGNIZING PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT**
**LIABILITIES**

The Group exercises considerable judgment in measuring and recognizing provisions and contingent
liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement,
mediation, arbitration, or government regulation. Judgment is necessary in assessing the likelihood
that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the final
settlement. Provisions are recognized for losses from executory contracts, provided a loss is
considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Because of the inherent uncertainties in this
evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. In addition,
significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to taxes and litigation risks.
These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the
support of internal specialists, if available, or with the support of outside consultants, such as actuaries
or legal counsel. Revisions to the estimates of these losses from executory contracts may significantly
affect future results of operations. For the Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) we had as a base the
costs results from the past and expectation of the future costs and discounted these amounts. The
provision has a period lifetime equal to the lifetime of the network license.

**2.11.4 JUDGMENT IN DISCLOSURE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES T-MOBILE INFRA B.V.**

**_Judgement in accounting for demerger of Infra B.V. and subsequent lease back of assets_**

On 1 September 2018, T-Mobile demerges Infra B.V., consisting primarily of passive infrastructure and
site lease agreements, and subsequently transfers Infra B.V. as a dividend in kind to Deutsche
Telekom Europe B.V., the company’s parent company, on 1 January 2019. In 2018 after the demerger,
T-Mobile entered into a lease agreement with the newly founded Infra B.V. regarding the demerged
passive infrastructure and sites. We have concluded that the transfer of Infra B.V. is a transfer of a
business as it meets the definitions under IFRS. The business was transferred in the amount of EUR
130 million of net assets of which EUR 82 million related to allocated goodwill previously recognized on
the acquisition of a network. It also includes an amount of EUR 343 million for a right of use asset and
a lease liability for the same amount recognized under IFRS 16 for the site leases on 1 January 2019.

We have also concluded that the transfer of the business is a transaction under common control and in
accordance with our accounting policies, such transfer and dividend in kind distribution takes place at
book values. The lease contract entered into is accounted for under IFRS 16. The right of use asset
recognized for the lease agreement between T-Infra and T-Mobile which includes lease payments for
the passive infrastructure and the site leases, but also for maintenance, amounted to EUR 435 million
as at 1 January 2019. This means that the passive equipment previously carried at cost and the right of
use assets related to the greenfield and rooftop spaces is transferred and consequently leased back.
As the lease is entered into at market terms the right of use asset for the new lease is measured in line
with these market terms.

F-116


-----

Considering the substance of the transaction, we assessed whether the sale lease back guidance of
IFRS 16 should be applicable in this transaction and as such should the passive infrastructure remain
at its original book-value and not be remeasured, leading to lower amortization in the future. We have
considered both applicability of the sale lease back guidance as well as the alternative view that sale
and lease back guidance is not applicable. We concluded that while in substance this may well
represent a sale and lease back transaction, the original transfer of the Infra business is a transaction
under common control, for which IFRC 17 is not applicable. Our policy is to account for non-cash
dividends within the group and other common control transactions at book value. Applying sale lease
back guidance will result in a lower right of use asset and as such a lower amount of depreciation in
the future which is akin to recognizing a gain on the distribution of Infra to the parent at a later date,
which is contradicting the purpose of the common control transaction guidance. We therefore
concluded that the sale lease back guidance is not applicable, which is regarded a management
judgement in our accounting for this transaction.

Following the decision to distribute T-Mobile Infra B.V. to the shareholders of the Group, the T-Mobile
Infra B.V. assets and liabilities have been presented in the financial statements as held for distribution
to owners in the financial statements 2018. In this respect management needed to make judgments
regarding the allocation of goodwill associated with the operation, anticipating where the goodwill will
be recovered going forward. As per 1 January 2019 the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary
were derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position.

**2.11.5** **JUDGMENT:** **REVENUE** **RECOGNITION,** **CONTRACT** **ASSETS** **AND** **LIABILITIES/**
**CONTRACT COSTS**

One-time payments by the customer for contracts that can be terminated at any time are recognized
over an expected contract period, the length of which depends on the period over which the customer
is likely from a commercial perspective to renew or not terminate the contract on a monthly basis.

Gross versus net presentation: For assessment of gross or net presentation of revenues, the Company
has assessed its customer contracts and has determined that it acts as a principal in all its contracts
with customers. The Company has also assessed that revenues from handsets sold by indirect
partners must be presented net, since the indirect partners are the principals in selling the handsets.
The revenues from the other contract components from these indirect sales, e.g. service and
connection fees are presented gross, since the company is the principal for these products and
services.

The standalone selling prices of individual products or services that are part of multiple-element
arrangements are complex to determine, because some of the elements are price-sensitive and, thus,
volatile in a competitive marketplace. In many cases, standalone selling prices can also not be
observed for the company’s own products. Due to the fact that comparability is generally not
completely assured, the use of market prices for similar products is subject to an element of
uncertainty, as is an estimate using a cost-plus-margin approach. Changes in estimates of standalone
selling prices can significantly influence the allocation of the transaction price for the entire multipleelement arrangement among the individual performance obligations and therefore affect both the
financial position, i.e., the carrying amount of contract assets and contract liabilities, and the current
and future results of operations.

Contract costs are recognized as an expense and amortized on a systematic basis over the expected
duration of the customer relationship. The estimate of the expected average duration of customer
retention is based on historical customer turnover. However, this is subject to fluctuations and has only
limited informative value with regard to future customer behavior, particularly if new products are rolled
out. If management’s estimates are revised, material differences may result in the amount and timing
of expenses for subsequent periods.

The significance of material rights is an estimate that is based on both quantitative and qualitative
factors. This is ultimately a matter of judgment, even though it is supported by quantitative facts.
Depending on the decision as to whether or not the customer has a material right to be deferred, there
may be material differences in the amount and timing of revenues for the current and subsequent
periods.

**2.11.6 JUDGMENTS: EXTENSION AND TERMINATION OPTIONS FOR THE LESSEE**

In determining the term of leases of cell site space, land/ground, office buildings, and retail stores,
which are the most relevant lease contracts in the Group, the following are the most relevant factors
that are considered:

    - Rapidly advancing and ever-changing technology in the telecommunications industry requires
flexible lease contracts, i.e., management tries to minimize longer periods during which the
contracts cannot be canceled.

    - When determining whether an extension of a lease contract is reasonably certain, in addition
to any significant penalties for terminating (or not extending) the lease, business plans and
the business model are considered, e.g., cost/benefit analysis, consolidation plans for the
mobile network and office facilities, new mobile network standards, significance of the
property for the underlying operations, replacement or usage of additional technology, as well
as the availability and cost of alternative locations.

    - Often leasehold improvements can also be used in alternative locations. In many cases, the
costs of moving or replacing the asset or initial construction costs are not the main factor
considered when determining whether to extend or not to extend the lease.

    - Significant investments made in a location, e.g., construction of towers and masts on the
leased land, are economic penalties typically considered when determining the lease term.

After having considered all of the factors above, for cell site contracts the Group concluded that it is not
reasonably certain that an option to extend the lease term beyond the initial non-cancelable lease term
will be exercised. For cell site contracts—including the land/ground underneath the infrastructure, the
lease term of on average 7 years is considered reasonably certain depending on the significance of the
leasehold improvement. Extension options after that period are typically not considered reasonably
certain at commencement of the lease. Payments associated with these optional periods are not
included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.

Most extension options for office and shop leases are not included in the lease liability because
T-Mobile could replace the leased assets without significant cost or business disruption. Exposure to
future additional cash outflows will only arise when an extension option (not determined to be
reasonably certain) is exercised or when a termination option (determined to be reasonably certain) is
not exercised.

After the commencement date, the assessment of a reasonable certainty exercise is only reassessed if
a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs that affects this judgment, and this
is within the control of the lessee. T-Mobile reassesses the lease term when an option is exercised (or
not exercised) or it becomes obligated to exercise (or not exercise).

The cell site lease with T-Mobile Infra B.V. has an initial non-cancelable period of 15 years, during
which the lease cannot be terminated. The initial period of time is followed by two renewal periods of
ten years each (optional renewal period) and another unlimited numbers of further renewal periods of
ten years each (additional renewal) if not terminated. T-Mobile has the right to terminate after the initial
term and before each optional and additional renewal, and Infra after the first additional renewal period.
T-Mobile’s termination rights after the initial lease term and the after the two optional renewal periods,
are options to extend the lease. This means that the non-cancelable period ends when T-Mobile can
exercise its termination right, and for any following periods T-Mobile has effectively an option to extend,
i.e. a unilateral right not to terminate the contract. As a consequence, management of T-Mobile had to
assess for what periods it is reasonably certain that it does not exercise the option and will thereby not
extend the contract beyond the non-cancellable period. Management came to the conclusion that it is
not reasonably certain that the option to renew the lease after the non-cancelable lease term of
15 years will be exercised. Therefore, the lease term under the application of IFRS 16 is deemed to be
15 years. This is in line with the strategically horizon of T-Mobile.

In determining the lease term, management applies judgment and considers all facts and
circumstances that create an economic incentive for T-Mobile to exercise an extension option, or not to

F-118


-----

exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included
in the lease term if T-Mobile is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to
exercise an option to terminate the lease. The threshold for a “reasonably certain” exercise is lower
than “virtually certain” and higher than “more likely than not” under IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent
liabilities and Contingent Assets.”

**2.12** **SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The main asset and liability items in the consolidated balance sheet are measured as follows:

**Items in the statement of financial position:** **Measurement principle:**

**Assets:**
_Current assets:_
Cash and cash equivalents Amortized cost

Trade and other receivables Depending on the underlying business model in each individual
case: at amortized cost, at fair value through other
comprehensive income with recycling to profit or loss, or at fair
value through profit or loss. FVOCI receivables are high quality
receivables (highly liquid) and factored right after inception and
as such, no movement in OCI.

Contract assets Amortized cost

Current income taxes Amount expected to be recovered from the taxation authorities

Inventories Lower of net realizable value and cost

Assets classified as held for Lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs of disposal
distribution to owners

_Non-current assets:_
Trade and other receivables Depending on the underlying business model in each individual
case: at amortized cost, at fair value through other
comprehensive income with recycling to profit or loss, or at fair
value through profit or loss. FVOCI receivables are high quality
receivables (highly liquid) and factored right after inception and
as such, no movement in OCI.

Intangible assets (excluding goodwill) Amortized cost or lower recoverable amount

Goodwill Cost or lower recoverable amount (Impairment-only approach)

Property, plant and equipment Amortized cost or lower recoverable amount

Right-of-use assets Amortized cost or lower recoverable amount

Capitalized contract costs Amortized cost or lower recoverable amount

Deferred tax assets Non-discounted amount measured at the tax rates that are
expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized, or
the liability settled

**Liabilities:**
_Current liabilities:_
Financial liabilities Amortized cost

Trade and other payables Amortized cost

Other provisions Non-discounted amount used in measurement

Liabilities classified as held for Higher of carrying amount or fair value including costs of
distribution to owners disposal

Other provisions Non-discounted amount used in measurement. For the ARO
provision we used discounted amounts in the measurement

Contract liabilities Amortized cost

Lease liabilities Amortized cost

The material principles on recognition and measurement outlined below were applied uniformly to all
accounting periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.

**2.12.1 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (EXCLUDING GOODWILL)**

Intangible assets with finite useful lives, including UMTS and LTE licenses and software, are measured
at cost and generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Such assets are
impaired if their recoverable amount, which is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and value in use, is lower than the carrying amount.

The useful lives and the amortization methods of the assets are reviewed at least at each financial
year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as
changes in accounting estimates in accordance with IAS 8. Amortization of mobile communications
licenses begins as soon as the related network is ready for use. The useful lives of mobile
communications licenses are determined based on several factors, including the term of the licenses
granted by the respective regulatory body in each country, the availability and expected cost of
renewing the licenses, as well as the development of future technologies.

The useful lives of the Group most important mobile communications licenses and software is as
follows:

**Years:**
Licenses (2G/3G/4G/5G) 16-17
LTE Licenses 11-15 (20 after extension)
Software 2

Expenditures for intangible assets (e.g. software) incurred during the development phase are
capitalized if they meet the criteria for recognition as assets and are amortized over their useful lives.
Research expenditures are expensed as incurred. Development is the application of research findings
or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials,
devices, products, processes, systems, or services prior to the commencement of commercial
production or use. Examples of activities typically included in development are the design,
construction, and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models involving new technology.

The development phase is deemed complete when the IT department has formally documented that
the capitalized asset is ready for its intended use.

**2.12.2 GOODWILL**

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment based on the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the goodwill is allocated (impairment-only approach). The impairment test is
carried out at the end of each financial year, as well as whenever there are indications that the carrying
amount of the cash-generating unit is impaired.

F-120


-----

**2.12.3 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less (accumulated) straight-line depreciation, and
impairment losses, if applicable. The depreciation period is based on the expected useful life of the
assets. Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated pro rata temporize in the year of
acquisition. The residual values, useful lives, and the depreciation methods of the assets are reviewed
at least at each financial year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are
accounted for as changes in accounting estimates in accordance with IAS 8.

In addition to directly attributable costs, the costs of internally developed assets include proportionate
indirect material and labor costs, as well as administrative expenses relating to production or the
provision of services. In addition to the purchase price and costs directly attributable to bringing the
asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended
by management, costs also include the estimated costs for dismantling and removing the asset, and
restoring the site on which it is located. If an item of property, plant and equipment consists of several
components with different estimated useful lives, those components that are significant are depreciated
over their individual useful lives.

Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Public investment grants reduce the cost of
the assets for which the grants were made.

On disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal, the carrying amount of the item is derecognized. The gain or loss
arising from the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net
disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item and is recognized as other operating
income or other operating expenses when the item is derecognized.

The useful lives of material asset categories are presented in the following table:

**Years:**
Installations, machinery and equipment 3-8
Other non-current assets 5
Leasehold improvements 10-15

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or applicable lease
terms.

**2.12.4 BORROWING COSTS**

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a
qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. The Group defines qualifying assets as
construction projects or other as- sets for which a period of at least twelve months is necessary in
order to get them ready for their intended use or sale. Borrowing costs relating to assets measured at
fair value are not capitalized.

**2.12.5 IMPAIRMENTS OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS (INCLUDING GOODWILL) AND ITEMS OF**
**PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS**

Impairments are identified by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount. If individual
assets do not generate future cash flows independently of other assets, recoverability is assessed on
the basis of the cash-generating unit to which the assets can be allocated. At each reporting date, the
Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit must be determined. In addition,
annual impairment tests are carried out for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill) at a
yearly basis.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each
of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the

F-121


-----

carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable
amount, goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit must be reduced in the amount of the
difference. Impairment losses for goodwill must not be reversed. If the impairment loss recognized for
the cash-generating unit exceeds the carrying amount of the allocated goodwill, the additional amount
of the impairment loss is to be distributed on a pro-rata basis to the assets allocated to the cashgenerating unit. The fair values or values in use (if measurable) of the individual assets shall be
considered to be the minimum values. If the reasons for previously recognized impairments no longer
exist, the impairment losses on the assets concerned (with the exception of goodwill) must be
reversed.

The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and the value in use. The recoverable amount is generally determined by means of a
discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation, unless it can be determined on the basis of a market price.
These DCF calculations use projections that are based on financial budgets approved by management
covering a ten-year period and are also used for internal purposes. The planning horizon reflects the
assumptions for short- to mid-term market developments. Cash flows beyond the ten-year period are
extrapolated using appropriate growth rates. For the key assumptions on which management has
based its calculation of the recoverable amount, please refer to Note 2.10.3.

**2.12.6 INVENTORIES**

Inventories are carried at cost on initial recognition and are subsequently measured at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is measured using the
weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is the estimated standalone selling price in the
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the necessary estimated selling
expenses.

**2.12.7 ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OWNERS**

Assets (or disposal groups) and liabilities are classified as held for distribution to owners when the
entity is committed to distribute the asset to the owners. For this to be the case, the assets and
liabilities must be available for immediate distribution in their present condition and the distribution
must be highly probable. For the distribution to be highly probable, actions to complete the distribution
must have been initiated and should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of
classification. Actions required to complete the distribution should indicate that it is unlikely that
significant changes to the distribution will be made or that the distribution will be withdrawn.

Those assets and related liabilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to distribute, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee
benefits, financial instruments and investment property that are carried at fair value.

An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal
group) to fair value less costs to distribute. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair
value less costs to distribute of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative
impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the
distribution of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognized at the date of derecognition.

Assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortized while they
are classified as held for distribution to owners. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities
of a disposal group classified as held for distribution to owners continue to be recognized.

Assets classified as held for distribution to owners and the assets of a disposal group classified as held
for distribution to owners are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for distribution to owners are presented separately from
other liabilities in the balance sheet.

**2.12.8 PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes with different pension
providers. The Group pays contributions to the pension insurance provider on a contractual basis and
has no further obligations once the contributions have been paid. Due to all risks were transferred,
there were no further transactions for post-employment benefit plans.

**_T-Mobile Netherlands Retail B.V._**

T-Mobile Netherlands Retail B.V. employees who work in the shops participate in the defined benefit
scheme financed with a collective fixed annual premium with the industry-wide pension fund for the
retail industry. T-Mobile accounts for the defined benefit scheme with the industry-wide pension fund
for the retail industry as though it was a defined contribution scheme. In the event of a deficit at the
industry-wide pension fund, the Group has no obligation to pay supplementary contributions.

The pension fund carries an indexed career average pension scheme. These defined benefit plans are
recognized as defined contribution plans because the funds accounts are not designed to be able to
identify the part of the pension liabilities and assets belonging to T-Mobile. T-Mobile is obliged to pay a
pre-agreed contribution to these plans. T-Mobile is not entitled to any surplus and is not liable for any
deficit, except by future adjustments to the contribution rates.

The actual coverage ratio of Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Detailhandel at 31 December
2019 was 112% (106.5% at 31 December 2018), an increase of 5.16% compared to 31 December
2018. Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Detailhandel is a multiemployer plan because a
collectively bargained plan is maintained by more than one employer within the same industry. At the
end of 2019 there were 30,000 employers participating in the pension fund. T-Mobile is one of the
many participants in this pension fund and our exposure is limited. The expected contribution for 2019
is EUR1,466 thousand (2018: EUR 1,152 thousand).

**2.12.9 OTHER PROVISIONS**

Other provisions are recognized for current legal or constructive obligations to third parties that are
uncertain with regard to their timing or their amount. Provisions are recognized for these obligations
provided they relate to past transactions or events, will probably require an outflow of resources to
settle, and this outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions are carried at their expected settlement
amount, taking into account all identifiable risks and uncertainties.

The settlement amount is calculated on the basis of a best estimate; suitable estimation methods and
sources of information are used depending on the characteristics of the obligation. In case of a number
of similar obligations, the Group of obligations is treated as one single obligation. The expected value
method is used as the estimation method.

If there is a range of potential events with the same probability of occurrence, the average value is
taken. Individual obligations (e.g., legal and litigation risks) are regularly evaluated based on the most
probable outcome, provided an exceptional probability distribution does not mean that other estimates
would lead to a more appropriate evaluation. The measurement of provisions is based on past
experience, current costing and price information, as well as estimates and reports from experts.

If experience or current costing or price information is used to determine the settlement amount, these
values are extrapolated to the expected settlement date. Suitable price trend indicators (e.g.,
construction price indexes or inflation rates) are used for this purpose.

Provisions are discounted for the time value of money. Provisions are discounted using pre-tax market
interest rates that reflect the term of the obligation and the risk associated with it (insofar as not already
taken into consideration in the calculation of the settlement amount). Reimbursement claims are not
netted against provisions; they are recognized separately as soon as their realization is virtually
certain.

F-123


-----

Provisions for decommissioning, restoration, and similar obligations arising from the acquisition of
property, plant and equipment are offset by a corresponding increase in the capitalized cost of the
relevant asset. Changes at a later date in estimates of the amount or timing of payments or changes to
the interest rate applied in measuring such obligations also result in retrospective increases or
decreases in the carrying amount of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. These in turn
change the depreciation of the asset to be recognized in the future, which leads to the changes in
estimates being recognized in profit or loss over the remaining useful life.

Where the decrease in the amount of a provision exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset, the
excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**2.12.10 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

Financial instruments are recognized as soon as The Group becomes a party to the contractual
regulations of the financial instrument. For regular purchases or sales, the settlement date is relevant
for the initial recognition and derecognition. This is the day on which the asset is delivered to or by The
Group. In general, financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in
the statement of financial position when, and only when, the entity currently has a right to offset the
recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis.

Transferred financial assets are derecognized in full if substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred or if some of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred (risk
sharing) and the acquirer has both the legal and the practical ability to sell the assets to a third party. If,
in cases where risk is shared, the acquirer is unable to sell the assets to a third party, the assets will
continue to be recognized to the extent of the maximum risk retained. Financial liabilities are
derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract expires or if there is a substantial
modification of the terms of the contract.

**Financial assets**

Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, originated loans, financial lease
receivables and other receivables. In Note 2.12.11 the accounting policies on financial assets have
been disclosed.

**Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities include financial liabilities that are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost.
In Note 2.12.12 the accounting policies on financial assets, liabilities have been disclosed.

**2.12.11 FINANCIAL ASSETS**

**a) Classification**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

    - those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income
or through profit or loss), and

    - those to be measured at amortized cost.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the
contractual terms of the cash flows.

**b) Initial recognition and measurement**

Financial assets are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. For all financial assets not
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), the transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition are taken into account plus, in the case of debt instruments, a loss
account for expected credit losses. The fair values recognized in the statement of financial position are

F-124


-----

generally based on market prices of the financial assets. If these are not available, the fair value is
determined using standard valuation models on the basis of current market parameters.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual
cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. In order for a financial
asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive
income, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on
the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at
an instrument level.

The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets
in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from
collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.

**c) Subsequent measurement**

Subsequent measurement depends on the group’s business model for managing the asset and the
cash flow characteristics of the asset.

The Group has only financial assets that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables and originated loans and other receivables. The measurement of these financial assets is
described below:

**d) Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash accounts including group cash pooling and short-term cash
deposits at banks; they have maturities of up to three months at initial recognition.

**e) Trade receivables and originated loans and other receivables**

Trade receivables are recognized initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional, unless
they contain significant financing components, then they are recognized at fair value. Instruments with
a significant financing component are initially measured at fair value.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured depending on the
underlying business model at amortized cost, less impairment, fair value through other comprehensive
income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or
costs.

For more information on receivables, reference is made to Note 2.11 for the accounting policies and
Note 5 Trade and Other receivables.

**f) Receivables from free-standing other derivative financial instruments**

T-Mobile applies an enhanced Binomial Option Pricing Model that allows for exercising of options
before the end of the option’s life.

The Binomial Option Pricing Model computes enterprise value estimates for each step in-time between
the valuation date and the option or warrant expiration date; effectively resulting in a binomial tree. At
each final node of the tree (i.e. at expiration of the option) the option value is simply its intrinsic or
exercise value. Under the risk neutrality assumption, today’s fair price of a derivative is equal to the
discounted expected value of its future payoff. Therefore, at each earlier node of the tree, the option
value is calculated using the option values from the next two nodes weighted by their respective
probabilities. The expected value is then discounted at the risk-free rate.

F-125


-----

**g) Derecognition**

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial
assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated statement of financial
position) when:

   - The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired

Or

   - The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a
‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the
asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to
the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability.
The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and
obligations that the Group has retained.

**h) Impairment of financial assets**

The Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held
at fair value through profit or loss. The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring
expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and
contract assets. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have
been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets
relate to services provided, respectively handsets sold but not yet billed and have substantially the
same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The group has
therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation
of the loss rates for the contract assets.

**2.12.12 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES**

**a) Initial recognition and measurement**

Financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition. For all financial liabilities not
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to
the acquisition are also a component of the carrying amount. If the contractual payment term for
liabilities to suppliers is longer than the normal credit period in the relevant procurement market at this
point in time, this liability is reported under other interest-bearing liabilities in financial liabilities instead
of under trade payables. A financing agreement of this nature is shown as a non-cash transaction in
the statement of cash flows and the relevant repayment of the financial liability reported under net cash
from/used in financing activities. This applies regard- less of whether the supplier sells its receivable or
not.

**b) Subsequent measurement**

The Group has only financial liabilities that are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost (AC).
The measurement of financial liabilities at amortized cost are described below.

**c) Financial liabilities at amortized cost**

Loans and borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the consolidated income statement over

F-126


-----

the period of the loan using the effective interest method. In the cash flow statement, the Group has
classified cash payments for group loans as financing activities consistent with the presentation of
interest payments chosen by the Group.

**d) Derecognition**

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an
exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a
new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the consolidated
income statement.

**e) Determination of fair value**

The fair value of financial instruments not listed in an active market, is determined by using appropriate
valuation techniques. Valuation techniques include net present value techniques, comparison to similar
instruments for which market observable prices exist, options pricing models and other relevant
valuation models.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are
categorized within the fair value hierarchy. This is described, as follows, based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

   - Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

   - Level 2—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly observable

   - Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable

**2.12.13 CONTINGENCIES (CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND ASSETS)**

Contingencies (contingent liabilities and assets) are potential liabilities or assets arising from past
events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more
uncertain future events not entirely within the control of the Group. Contingent liabilities are also
present obligations that arise from past events for which an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits is not probable or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient
reliability. Contingent liabilities are only recognized at their fair value if they were assumed in the
course of a business combination.

Contingent liabilities not assumed in the course of a business combination are not recognized.
Contingent assets are not recognized. However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then
the related asset is no longer a contingent asset, but it is recognized as an asset. Information on
contingent liabilities is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless the
possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. The same applies to
contingent assets where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

**2.12.14 LEASES**

A lease is an agreement in which the lessor conveys the right to use an asset for an agreed period of
time to the lessee in return for a payment or series of payments. The scope of IFRS 16 covers
standard lease, rental, and tenancy agreements as well as agreements in which the lessee is granted
other rights to use assets. A lease only exists if the right-of-use asset is within the control of the lessee.
The lessee has control when it has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from
use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset.

F-127


-----

**a) Lessee**

At the commencement date, a right-of-use asset measured at cost and a lease liability measured at the
present value of the future lease payments must be recognized in the statement of financial position for
all leases. This also applies to leases for which the underlying asset is of low value and to short-term
leases (lease term of no more than twelve months). Non-lease components are not separated from
lease components, i.e., all non-lease payments due under the contract are also recognized in the
statement of financial position. This principle does not include contracts relating to data centers, which
due to their special requirements in terms of equipment and premises form their own separate class of
underlying asset. For this class of underlying assets, the non-lease payments are recognized as an
expense.

The lease liability is recognized at the present value of the future lease payments over the reasonably
certain period of use. Lease payments are all fixed and in-substance payments, less any future lease
incentives payable by the lessor. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, expected
payments under residual value guarantees, and payments for reasonably certain purchase and
termination options are also recognized. The series of payments is discounted at the interest rate
implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing
rate. All other variable payments are recognized as an expense. The lease liability is measured using
the effective interest method and adjusted.

The cost of the right-of-use asset is determined as the amount of the initial measurement of the lease
liability plus any initial direct costs incurred for obtaining the lease, the costs of installing the leased
asset, and an estimate of any future restoration costs, less any lease incentives received from the
lessor. In subsequent measurement, the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over
the lease term and, if applicable, adjusted for any impairment losses. If ownership of the leased asset
is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term, or if it is reasonably certain that a purchase or
sale option will exist, the right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the end of
the useful life of the underlying asset.

The lease term is the period in which it is reasonably certain that an asset will be leased. In addition to
the non-cancelable period of a lease, extensions will be included if their exercise is reasonably certain
at the commencement of the lease term. This estimate is only to be reassessed upon occurrence of an
event that necessitates a change. The lease term will be revised if an extension option not previously
included in the entity’s determination of the lease term is exercised or a termination option not
previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term is not exercised. The adjustment of
the lease term leads to a change in the future series of payments and therefore to remeasurement of
the lease liability using a market rate of interest. The difference is recognized outside profit or loss as
part of the cost of the right-of-use asset. Amounts derecognized that exceed the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset are recognized as an expense in profit or loss.

A lease modification that substantially increases the scope of the original lease is accounted for as a
separate lease if the lessee is granted an additional right to use one or more underlying assets and the
consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the
increase in scope that the lessee would otherwise have to pay for use if it had leased these assets
from a third party under a separate lease.

Lease modifications that increase the scope of the lease but do not lead to the recognition of a
separate lease are recognized outside profit or loss as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset and the lease liability for the existing lease. If a lease modification decreases the
scope of the lease, the lessee must remeasure both the right-of-use asset and the lease liability and
recognize any gain or loss on a pro-rata basis in profit or loss. The modified leases are measured at
the modification date with the new, applicable interest rate. In cash flow statement, the Group has
classified cash payments for leases as financing activities consistent with the presentation of interest
payments chosen by the Group.

-----

**b) Lessor**

If substantially all risks and rewards are attributable to the lessor (operating lease), the leased asset is
recognized in the statement of financial position by the lessor. Measurement of the leased asset is then
based on the accounting policies applicable to that asset. The lease payments are recognized in profit
or loss by the lessor. Contractually defined future changes in the lease payments during the term of the
lease are recognized as revenue from leases on a straight-line basis over the entire lease term, which
is defined only once at the inception date of the contract. Where extension options exist, the exercise
of those extension options that are reasonably certain is initially taken into account at the time the
lease is concluded. If, contrary to the original expectation, these options are exercised or not exercised
during the lease term, the estimated term will be adjusted and taken into account in the calculation of
future lease revenue from operating lease transactions.

If substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset are attributable to the
lessee (finance lease), the lessor recognizes at the commencement date, in place of the leased asset,
a finance lease receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The net investment in
the lease is defined as the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the unearned
finance income. The lease payments made by the lessees are split into an interest component and a
principal component using the effective interest method. In subsequent measurement, the lease
receivable is reduced by the principal received. The interest component of the payments received is
recognized as finance income in the income statement.

For sale and leaseback transactions, if there is a transfer of control within the meaning of IFRS 15,
T-Mobile as the seller-lessee measures the asset at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of
the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred
to the lessor is recognized in profit or loss as the selling profit or loss. If there is no transfer of control,
the transaction is recognized as a financing transaction. The underlying asset that is legally the subject
of the lease is not derecognized and is not recognized as a lease.

**2.12.15 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PROGRAMS**

**_Stock appreciation rights_**

Liabilities for the Group’s share appreciation rights are recognized as employee benefit expense over
the relevant service period. The liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date and are
presented as employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.

For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods and services acquired and the liability
incurred have to be recognized at the fair value of the liability. The fair value of the liability has to be
remeasured at each reporting date and at the settlement date, and the changes in the fair value have
to be recognized in profit and loss, until the liability is settled.

**2.12.16 NET REVENUE, CONTRACT ASSETS, CONTRACT LIABILITIES AND CAPITALIZED**
**CONTRACT COSTS**

Net revenues include all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Group. Ordinary activities
refer to the core business and to other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services.

Revenues are recorded net of value-added tax and other taxes collected from customers. Value-added
tax and other taxes collected are remitted to governmental authorities.

Net revenues are recognized in accordance with the provision of goods or services, provided that
collectability of the consideration is probable. For service contracts with a continuous service provision,
the contractually agreed total consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the
minimum contract term, regardless of the payment pattern.

A contract asset must be recognized if the Group recorded revenue for fulfilment of a contractual
performance obligation before the due date of the consideration from the customer.

F-129


-----

A contract liability must be recognized when the customer paid consideration or a receivable from the
customer is due before the Group fulfilled a contractual performance obligation and thus recognized
revenue. In a customer contract, contract liabilities must be set off against contract assets.

Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services (e.g.
mobile service contract plus handset) must be separated into distinct performance obligations, based
on the stand-alone selling price that is recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the
customer. In the Group, this especially concerns the sale of a mobile handset or other
telecommunications equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed-network
telecommunications service contract. The total transaction price of the bundled contract is allocated
among the individual performance obligations based on their relative—possibly estimated—standalone
selling prices, i.e., based on a ratio of the standalone selling price of each separate element to the
aggregated standalone selling prices of the contractual performance obligations. The Group does not
sell own produced products (e.g. handsets).

As a result, the revenue to be recognized for products (often delivered in advance) such as mobile
handsets that are sold in combination with a long-term service contract may be either higher or lower
than the amount billed or collected, depending on the ratio for these products relative to the
aggregated standalone selling prices.

This leads to the recognition of what is known as a contract asset or a contract liability in the statement
of financial position, depending on whether the revenue recognized is higher (contract asset) or lower
(contract liability) compared to the amount billed or collected. The contract asset is a receivable arising
from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence. This leads to higher revenue,
in contrast to the amounts billed from the sale of goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the
provision of services. The contract liability is an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer
for which the entity has received consideration, or for which an amount of consideration is due from the
customer. The contract liability is reversed and reduced over the remaining contract period, increasing
revenue from the other performance obligations (in this: mobile service revenues) and results in lower
revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise compared with the amounts billed.

As distinct from promotional offers, options to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or
at a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is
deferred as a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires, providing the discount on future
purchases is an implicit component of the consideration for the current contract and is also significant.
The measure of significance is whether the decision by the (average) customer to enter into the current
contract is likely to have been significantly influenced by their right to the future discount. Offers for
volume discounts for the purchase of additional core products of an entity (e.g., a discount offered on
an additional fixed-network contract for mobile customers) are classed by the Group as promotional
offers to be excluded from consideration.

Long-term customer receivables (e.g., arising from sales of handsets in instalments), contract assets
(in connection with the conclusion of a long-term customer contract) or contract liabilities (e.g., arising
from a prepayment by the customer) are recognized at present value if the financing component is
significant in relation to the total contract value (i.e., including those performance obligations that do
not contain a financing component). The discount rate also reflects the customer credit risk. The Group
makes use of the option not to recognize a significant financing component if the period between when
a good or service is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service
will be one year or less.

Payments to customers including credits or subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in
revenue unless the payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service from the customer,
for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated.

Gross versus net presentation: In cases where a company is in an intermediary position between
another supplier/vendor (e.g., manufacturer, wholesaler) and a retail customer, it must be assessed
whether the company itself supplies the relevant product or provides the service requested by the
customer as the principal or whether the company merely acts as the agent for the supplier. The

F-130


-----

outcome determines whether the entity can recognize revenue on a gross basis (as the principal) or on
a net basis after deducting the costs to the supplier (as the agent). For the Group, the question arises
particularly in the case of digital services (e.g., streaming services) purchased from third parties and
sold to retail customers as part of the Group’s product portfolio.

In summary, in case of rights to another party’s goods or services, the Group considers itself to be the
principal vis-à-vis the retail customer if all of the following conditions are met and thus reports gross
revenues:

   - The Group either has a contractual enforceable right to receive the predefined services “on
demand” at predefined (fixed or variable) prices, and accordingly the other party has entered
into an enforceable ongoing commitment to provide them, or the Group has entered into a
material minimum purchase commitment.

   - The Group sells access to the other party’s services in its own name and for its own account
under a contract between the Group and the retail customer.

   - The Group has discretion in setting the price for the other party’s services sold for its own
account.

Contract costs comprise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commissions paid
to employees in the direct sales channel and third-party retailers in the indirect sales channel) and the
costs to fulfil a contract. These must be capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be
compensated by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are
additional costs that would have not been incurred had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfil
a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve
the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be capitalized under
any other standard. The Group makes not use of the option to immediately recognize contract costs
whose amortization period would be less than one year as an expense; this is in line with the DT group
accounting policy.

The capitalized contract costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
customer retention period. The expenses are disclosed in the Group’s income statement, not under
depreciation and amortization but—depending on the sales channel—as goods and services
purchased or personnel costs.

In the indirect sales channel, third-party retailers often arrange service contracts on behalf of and for
the account of the Group (as the agent), whereas in connection with the sale of handsets the
third-party retailer act in their own name and for their own account (as the principal). In such cases, the
third-party retailer receives the gross consideration of the handset from the Group and the same is
recognized as loan receivable from the end-customer by the Group.

In the direct sales channel the sale of subsidized handsets in connection with the conclusion of service
contracts (multiple-element arrangement) is still common with business customers, In the subsidy
model, an asset must thus be carried at the date of revenue recognition which is generally settled over
a 24-month service contract term through payments made by the business customer, whereby the
contract asset is repaid through the portion of the monthly invoice that exceeds the allocated monthly
service revenues.

Depending on the business model, revenue recognition at the Group is as follows:

The mobile and fixed-network business includes mobile services, narrow- and broadband access to the
fixed network and the internet, television via internet, connection and roaming fees billed to other
mobile operators (wholesale business), sales, other telecommunications equipment and accessories.
Revenue generated from the use of voice and data communications as well as television via internet is
recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. The services rendered relate to use by customers
(e.g., call minutes), availability over time (e.g., monthly flat rates), or other agreed rate plans. Revenue
and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are

F-131


-----

recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled company obligations that
affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement. The Group does not have warranties or
related obligations.

Trade-in rights for used handsets which are granted to customers upon contract conclusion under the
condition of a new purchase transaction (including renewal of an existing service contract) do not
constitute repurchase arrangements; however, if the repurchase prices exceed the fair value of the
handsets these rights must be recognized as separate performance obligations for which part of the
contractual revenue is deferred until they are exercised or expire.

Particularly in the mobile communications business, the timing of payments for mobile handsets
purchased in connection with the conclusion of a service contract differs from the timing of the delivery
and hence from revenue recognition. Where a significant financing component exists, revenue is
measured at the present value. In case of a sale of handsets in connection with the conclusion of
service contracts in the consumer business, the payment-by-instalment model is offered to customers.
In the payment-by-instalment model, a handset loan must thus be carried at the date of revenue
recognition which is generally repaid over a 24-month service contract term through payments made
by the customer.

**2.12.17 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

**_Other short-term employee’s benefits_**

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as
the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under
short-term liabilities if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a
result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably.

**2.12.18 INCOME TAXES**

Income taxes has included current income taxes as well as deferred taxes. Current and deferred tax
assets and liabilities must be recognized where they are probable. They are measured in accordance
with the tax laws applicable or already announced as of the reporting date, provided said
announcement has the effect of actual enactment.

Where current and deferred tax is recognized, it must be reported as income or expense except to the
extent that the tax arises from a transaction which is recognized outside profit and loss, either in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, or in connection with a business combination. Current tax
assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset in the
statement of financial position if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets
against current tax liabilities, has an intention to settle net, and the deferred tax assets and the
deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities must be recognized in the amount that the Group expects
to settle or recover from the tax authorities. They include liabilities/receivables for the current period as
well as for prior periods.

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the
consolidated statement of financial position and the tax base, as well as for tax loss carryforwards and
tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be
available to utilize those temporary differences and losses. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are
reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future
taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax
rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income
taxes, if any. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from
the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount
of its assets and liabilities.

F-132


-----

By way of derogation from this principle, deferred taxes are not recognized for temporary differences if
deferred taxes arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction which is not a
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable
profit/tax loss. Deferred taxes are not recognized either for temporary differences arising from the initial
recognition of goodwill.

Deferred taxes are generally recognized for temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, joint arrangements, and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.

Following the decision to distribute T-Mobile Infra B.V. to the shareholders of the Group, the T-Mobile
Infra B.V. assets and liabilities have been presented in the financial statements of the prior year as
held for distribution to owners. As per 1 January 2019 the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary
T-Mobile Infra B.V. were derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position.

No assets or liabilities held for sale or distribution is to be disclosed in 2019.

There was no change in the fair value of the assets to be distributed between the date on which the
distribution was approved and the date on which the dividend was settled. There is no difference
between the dividend paid/payable and the carrying amount of the assets distributed.

The major classes of assets and liabilities of the Group classified as held for distribution to owners of
the prior year as at 31 December 2018 are, as follows:

During 2019, two significant movements occurred as a result of the acquisition of Tele2 which resulted
as addition and the disposal of T-Mobile Infra B.V.

**SOFTWARE**

Software consists of capitalized development costs (internally generated software) and external
purchased software. Of the total amount of capitalized software, EUR 98.8 million is internally
generated software (31 December 2018: EUR 56.2 million). Pursuant to Dutch Law, capitalized
development costs require maintaining a legal reserve which is non distributable. Please see Note 42
for further details.

**GOODWILL**

Goodwill is monitored and tested for impairment by management at the level of the three operating
segments as determined in note 20. The segments represent the lowest level within the entity at which
the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The impairment test for the goodwill was
performed for the ending balance of the current period (31 December 2019) for the Company that
includes Tele2. The annual impairment test for the goodwill as of 31 December 2019 did not identify a
need for impairment. Management has considered the transition to IFRS 16 in preparing the
impairment test. These changes are reflected in the table below.

The recoverable amounts to be identified for the impairment test were determined on the basis of the
value in use. These figures were calculated using a net present value approach. The main parameters
are shown in the table below. Input for the calculations for the recoverable amounts are the ten-year

F-137


-----

business planning projections, which are based on financial plans that have been approved by
management and are also used for internal management purposes.

The key assumptions on which management has based its determination of the recoverable amount
include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on
past experience and extended to include internal expectations, and that are underscored by external
market data and estimates:

    - development of revenue,

    - customer acquisition and retention costs,

    - churn rates,

    - capital expenditure,

    - market share, and

    - growth rates.

Discount rates are determined on the basis of external figures derived from the market, taking account
of the market and country risks associated with the cash-generating unit. Changes in the assumptions
may have a negative impact, as a result of future macro-economic trends, continued intense
competition, further possible legislation changes (e.g., as part of national austerity programs), and
regulatory intervention. The following tables provide an overview of the main factors affecting the
measurement.

Neither the impairment test nor the review on the accuracy of the forecast give rise to an indication of
impairment. The goodwill impairment resulted in a significant headroom of the value in use as
compared to the carrying value. The goodwill carrying amount as per 31 December 2019 includes the
goodwill for Tele2. Changes in the assumptions may have a negative impact, as a result of future
macro-economic trends (e.g., impacts of COVID-19), continued intense competition, further possible
legislation changes (e.g., as part of national austerity programs), and regulatory intervention.

In 2018 only one cash generating unit (and operating segment) was identified and goodwill was
monitored and tested for impairment at the level of the company as a whole. However, since the
acquisition of Tele2 at the beginning of 2019, the chief operating decision maker (board of
management) examines the company’s performance based on its customer characteristics as opposed
to the company as a whole and identified the three operating segments. The goodwill is therefore
monitored and tested on a segment level instead of the company as a whole as from 2019.

**Assumption:** **Approach used to determine values:**

Sales volume Average annual growth rate over the ten-year forecast period; based
on past performance and management’s expectations of market
development.

Sales price Average annual growth rate over the ten-year forecast period; based
on current industry trends and including long term inflation forecasts
for each territory.

EBITDA margin Based on past performance and management’s expectations for the
future.

Sustainable Growth rate This is the weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash
flows beyond the budget period. The rates are consistent with
forecasts included in industry reports.

Annual capital expenditure Expected cash costs in the CGU. This is based on the historical
experience of management.

**OTHER INTANGIBLES**

Other intangibles primarily consist of customer relationships and favorable contracts identified at the
acquisition of Orange and Tele2.

**ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Depending on the nature of the specific project, assets under construction (AUC) are either presented
under intangible assets or property, plant or equipment. AUC in the tables above mainly represent
projects associated with new software or significant upgrades to existing software which have not been
implemented yet.

When projects included in AUC (both under intangible assets or property, plant and equipment) are
completed, the capitalized amount is allocated to the respective asset class which can result into a
transfer within the same asset class, from intangible fixed assets to property, plant and equipment or
the opposite way.

Assets under construction mainly represent costs incurred in the construction of the Group’s network.
When projects included in AUC (both under intangible assets or property, plant and equipment) are
completed, the capitalized amount is allocated to the respective asset class which can result into a
transfer within the same asset class, from intangible fixed assets to property, plant and equipment or
the opposite way. The additions primarily relate to investments in telecommunication equipment for the
modernization of the T-Mobile network.

During 2019, two significant movements occurred as a result of the acquisition of Tele2 which resulted
as addition and the disposal of T-Mobile Infra B.V.

The costs of obtaining a contract included in the carrying amount as per 31 December 2019 primarily
comprise of sales commissions paid to third-party retailers in the indirect sales channel and to
employees in the direct sales channel.

In the 2019 financial year, capitalized contract costs of EUR 56.1 million were amortized. The increase
of EUR 5.5 million in capitalized contract costs compared with the book value as of 31 December 2018
is mainly attributable to the acquisition of Tele2 Netherlands in 2019, offset by the amortization of the
capitalized contract costs. Of the total capitalized contract costs as per 31 December 2019,
EUR 13.9 million is attributable to Tele2 Netherlands.

Regarding the entity-wide disclosures, we do not meet the requirement to disclose geographic
information as we have no sales outside the Netherlands.

The total transaction price attributable to performance obligations that have not been fulfilled or, in
some cases, not yet fulfilled at the end of the reporting year (hereinafter: outstanding transaction price)
amounts to EUR 421 million (2018: EUR 366 million).

The portion of the outstanding transaction price attributable to performance obligations that have not
been fulfilled or, in some cases, not yet fulfilled at the end of the reporting year is generally recognized
as revenue over the remaining term of the service contracts concluded. Since most service contracts—
unless they can be canceled at any time—have a minimum contract term of 24 months, an average
remaining term of approximately 12 months can be assumed, provided the course of business in the
mass business remains virtually unchanged. The disclosures only refer to transactions within the scope
of IFRS 15, i.e., they do not include portions of the transaction price being allocated to performance
obligations outside the scope of the standard, e.g., leases.

**422,806** **354,366**

In 2007 and 2010, the Group effected a demerger of its entire business (i.e. all assets and liabilities)
including its operating company subsidiaries in exchange for shares emitted to T-Mobile Netherlands
Holding B.V.. These transactions resulted in step-ups in the tax basis (temporary differences) in the
fiscal unity T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V.. As a result of the acquisition of Tele2 Netherlands
Holding N.V. (and its affiliates) a revaluation was done and resulted in a step-up in tax basis on
1 January 2019.

The deferred tax asset recognized in the balance sheet relates for the main part to the abovementioned step ups. 2019 resulted in a tax loss for which a deferred tax asset is recognized. Currently,
tax losses can be carried back 1 year and carried forward 6 years. The Group has concluded that part
of the deferred tax assets will not be recoverable using the estimated future taxable income based on
the approved business plans and budgets. Based upon this tax assessment, the Group did not
recognize a part of the deferred tax asset (Unrecognized losses of EUR 11.1 million).

**32.** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS**

As per 2017 T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. introduced a Stock Appreciation Right (SAR) Scheme
over a period of four years. The Group offers the eligible employees SARs with the option to either
(i) participate in the Scheme in full (100%), (ii) participate in the Scheme for 50% or (iii) not participate
in the Scheme at all. Per 31 December 2019 the eligible participants consisting of T-Mobile board of
management, Leadership Team and Managers have signed up. In order to participate in the Scheme,
the eligible persons are required to make specific financial commitments. Therefore, the variable
compensation components of the Short Term Incentive (STI) and the Long Term Incentive (LTI) of an
eligible person will be paid in SARs.

Each SAR entitles the relevant participant to share in the value increase of the shares up to the vesting
date. The value increase is measured as the difference between the base enterprise value of T-Mobile
and the enterprise value at the vesting date.

The general scheme set-up is as follows. There are two classes of SARs:

(a) SARs in Class A, which relate to a Value Creation up to and including a certain value threshold
amount (“A SARs”); and

(b) SARs in Class B, which relate to a value creation in excess over the threshold amount (“B SARs”).

F-149


-----

A SARs and B SARs are granted, are allocated and vest in pairs (“SAR Pairs”). The ratio between
outstanding A SARs and B SARs are at all times 1:1. The total number of SAR pairs available to be
granted under the scheme is 10,000,000 (the “SAR pool”).

The vesting will entitle the participant to the SAR cash-out amount at the vesting date, which is the
earlier of the end date of the SAR scheme being 31 December 2021 or another exit event. The
cash-out payment is calculated as the percentage of the employee’s SAR pairs represent in the total
number of vesting SAR pairs multiplied by the amount Vesting Value.

The Vesting Value calculates as the sum of the amount becoming available on all Vesting A SARs,
being an amount equal to 8% of the Value Creation up to and including the Value Creation of the
threshold amount and the amount becoming available on all Vesting B SARs, being an amount equal
to 6% of the Value Creation in excess of the threshold amount.

The Value Creation is determined as an amount equal to the equity value of 100% of the Shares at the
Vesting Date (the “Realization Value (100%)”) minus the aggregate of the Base Equity Value (plus the
Net FCF Adjustment and minus Transaction Costs), whereby the Realization Value (100%) will be
determined by an Independent Appraiser, based on customary valuation principles.

The program is measured at fair value on each reporting date and recognized as expense over the
related service period. The fair value of SARs thereby is based on the fair value of T-Mobile,
determined by an Independent Appraiser. The valuation of SARs is based on the fair value of T-Mobile
on the date of grant and was determined prepared by an Independent Appraiser. The fair value of SAR
scheme rights as at 31 December 2019 SARs was calculated applying a probability weighted scenario
analysis to determine the fair value of the SAR scheme rights as at 31 December 2019. Given that the
pay-out under the SAR scheme is dependent on the future equity value of T-Mobile, the equity value
was estimated over time using a Binomial Tree. The probability of each pay-off is estimated and
multiplied by its respective outcome to derive a weighted average of the final payout value. Based on
the procedures performed, the valuation arrived at a total SAR scheme value as per the valuation date
of EUR 47.5 million. The total book value of the provision amounts to EUR 23.75 million. Stock-based
compensation expense was EUR 11.88 million as of 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR
11.16 million).

**34.** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT**

This note covers financial instruments and risk management. For further information on financial
instruments, please refer in particular to Note 5 “Trade and other receivables,” Note 8 “Other assets,”
Note 14 “Financial liabilities and lease liabilities,” Note 15 “Trade and other payables,” and Note 17
“Contract liabilities”.

**OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES**

The Group’s principal financial assets comprise of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and due
from related parties. The Group’s principal financial liabilities consist of payables and due to related
parties.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk (including currency risk,
interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

There have been no changes in the objectives, policies and processes for managing and measuring
risk from the previous year.

**MARKET RISK**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The
objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters. There are no price risks at the reporting date.

**FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT**

The Group mainly derives its revenues from its operations in the Netherlands and for some part by
generating roaming revenues for mobile traffic outside the Netherlands. Based on a risk analysis, the
Group determined that it is exposed to minimal currency risk as most of the transactions are
denominated in euros. The remaining risk is not material. No positions are hedged.

**CREDIT RISK**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables
from customers. The Group does not have any significant concentration of credit risk. The Group’s
clients primarily consist of consumers and businesses with low average balances which are regularly
reviewed. When necessary, these consumers are disconnected from service when no payment is
received. Credit risk is taken into account through a combination of specific and general valuation
allowances. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying
amount of each class of financial assets mentioned above.

For further information please also refer to the section “Transfer of assets (factoring of receivables)”
down below.

As at 31 December 2019, the gross amount of the trade receivables is EUR 624.6 million. Credit loss
allowances of EUR 85.8 million (31 December 2018: EUR 50.3 million) are recognized for
uncollectability.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped
based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to
unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables
for the same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for
trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 month before
31 December 2019 or 1 January 2019 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses
experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forwardlooking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the
receivables. The Group has identified the GDP and the unemployment rate of the countries in which it
sells its goods and services to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss
rates based on expected changes in these factors.

On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2019 was determined as included in the schedule
on for both trade receivables and contract assets.

The Group exercises considerable judgment in the classification of their in-house cash pool balances
as cash equivalents. These in-house cash pool balances are managed within the Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTAG) Group treasury function. The DTAG Group treasury function operates as an in-house bank
which has similar characteristics as a regular bank. It maintains sufficient cash and liquid resources,
along with access to credit lines, to meet all inter-company obligations simultaneously. With respect to
DTAG’s liquidity risk, DTAG has met its targets for the liquidity reserve to cover at least the maturities
for the next 24 months in both 2018 and 2019. Deutsche Telekom had standardized bilateral credit
agreements with 21 a total of EUR 12.6 billion as of 31 December 2019. As of 31 December 2019,
EUR 0.6 billion of these credit lines had been utilized. The DTAG central treasury department is
responsible for the coordination of all intragroup cash and payment flows. The internal control
processes and procedures from the DTAG central treasury department are implemented and
monitored according to the minimum requirements set by the German Financial Market Authority,
where applicable. The DTAG central treasury department monitors the balances of all companies that
are part of the central cash pooling and ensures sufficient funding of the respective balances.

In addition, the company has direct access to these cash pool accounts and is entitled to terminate the
cash pooling agreement without notice for good reason.

Management have therefore assessed that these balances are highly liquid instruments that are also
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

As at 31 December 2019, the Group’s maximum credit risk can be depicted as follows:

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk from fair value at profit or loss at 31 December 2019 and
31 December 2018 is equal to the carrying amounts.

**INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT**

The Group has two fixed interest group loan facilities. Therefore, the Group did not incur interest rate
risk. As per 31 December 2019 the fixed interest rate is 4.25%. However, future refinancing might lead
to a different interest rate.

**LIQUIDITY RISK**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet financial obligations as they fall due. The
Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group manages its liquidity risks by using Deutsche Telekom AG companies to secure financing.
If necessary, further funding is provided by the Group’s finance companies. In Note 14 the outstanding
loan payable with GTS Central European Holding B.V. has been disclosed.

As per 31 December 2019 there is one long-term loan which matures on December 2023. See for
details Note 14 “Financial liabilities” and Note 15 “Trade payables”.

The net debt increased by an amount of EUR 946,142 to EUR 1,800,323. The increase in 2019 was
mainly caused by the initial application of the new accounting standard for leases IFRS 16. As of
31 December 2019, the total lease liability amounts to EUR 813,086, thereof EUR 509,303 from the
lease commitments with T-Mobile Infra B.V. The movement in net debt are reflected in the following

**DISCLOSURES ON FAIR VALUE**

When determining the fair value, it is important to maximize the use of current inputs observable in
liquid markets for the financial instrument in question and minimize the use of other inputs (e.g.,
historical prices, prices for similar instruments, prices on illiquid markets). A three-level measurement
hierarchy is defined for these purposes. If prices quoted in liquid markets are available at the reporting
date for the respective financial instrument, these will be used unadjusted for the measurement (Level
1 measurement). Other input parameters are then irrelevant for the measurement.

If quoted prices on liquid markets are not available at the reporting date for the respective financial
instrument, but the instrument can be measured using other inputs that are observable on the market
at the reporting date, a Level 2 measurement will be applied. The conditions for this are that no major
adjustments have been made to the observable inputs and no unobservable inputs are used.

F-156


-----

If the conditions for a Level 1 or Level 2 measurement are not met, a Level 3 measurement is applied.
In such cases, major adjustments must be made to the observable inputs or unobservable inputs must
be used.

For the trade receivables, assigned to Level 3, which are measured either at fair value through profit
and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income, the main factor in determining fair value is
the credit risk of the relevant counterparties. If the default rates apply as of the reporting date had been
1 percent higher (lower) with no change in the reference variables, the fair values of the instruments
would have been 1 percent lower (higher).

Amounts due to group companies . . . . 2 1,324,178 1,176,803 2 — 1,125,435

The fair value of the financial instruments accounted for at amortized costs approximates their carrying
value as the interest rate risks is considered to be minimal given the low interest rate in the European
Union and limited changes in the interest rates, e.g. for financial instruments such as short-term trade
receivables and payables For these instruments no fair value is disclosed.

Liabilities to banks are mostly short-term nature, respectively have a variable interest rate. Therefore,
the fair value of liabilities to banks approximates the book value. The interest rate as the main input
factor for the fair value is observable at the market and therefore level 2 of the fair value hierarchy
applies.

The fair values of the amounts due to group companies mainly consists of the loan from DT Europe
B.V. amounting to a book value of EUR 1,083,319K (2018: EUR 1,125,000K). The fair value of the
loans from Deutsche Telekom group companies as of 31 December 2019 with EUR 1,300,736K is
calculated as the present values of the payments associated with the debt, based on the applicable
yield curve and credit spread curve.

**TRANSFER OF ASSETS (FACTORING OF RECEIVABLES)**

T-Mobile is party to factoring agreements under which it sells trade receivables on a revolving basis.
The receivables are sold on a daily basis or quarterly basis and settled on a monthly basis. The
receivables sold entail both telecom charges already due and charges from sales of handsets payable
over a period of up to two years. The debtors are consumers as well as business customers. In none of

with control remaining at T-Mobile without the involvement of structured entities (I) and the factoring
agreements involve the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining at T-Mobile with
the involvement of structured entities (II).

(I) Factoring transactions involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining
at T-Mobile without the involvement of structured entities.

A factoring transaction is in place under which banks are required to purchase trade receivables. The
receivables sold entail charges from sales of handsets payable over a period of up to two years. The
factoring agreement has a maximum funding amount of EUR 90 million. The purchase price will be
paid out immediately upon sale. On 5 December 2019 the term of this factoring transaction has been
extended for another two (2) years to 30 June 2021. The risks relevant for the risk assessment with
respect to the receivables sold are the credit risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). The
purchase price corresponds to the nominal amount. The maximum credit risk from the various tranches
to be borne by T-Mobile amounts to EUR 14.4 million (2018: EUR 14.6 million).

The other credit risk-related losses are borne by the banks. The late-payment risk continues to be
borne by T-Mobile. T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2019 amounted to EUR
14.4 million (2018: EUR 14.6 million), and the carrying amount of the associated liability was EUR
14.4 million (2018: EUR 14.6 million). The outstanding amount of receivables as per 31 December
2018 for this particular factoring transaction amounted to EUR 47.9 million (2018: EUR 78.5 million). In
2019 T-Mobile expensed EUR 0.6 million, including credit-risk discounts and loss allocations to cover
monthly credit risks, in the financial year from its continuing involvement including program fees
(interest and bank margin), and has expensed a total amount of EUR 5.1 million since the beginning of
the transaction.

(II) Factoring transactions involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining
at T-Mobile with the involvement of structured entities.

The factoring agreements have a maximum program volume of EUR 150 million. If the buyer agrees to
purchase receivables beyond this amount, the purchase price payment shall be deferred until the
maximum program volume decreases again by the corresponding amount. With this structure, there is
no structured entity consolidated by T-Mobile. Rather, the receivables are sold directly to a structured
entity that is not consolidated by T-Mobile due to the lack of ability to direct the entity’s relevant
activities. This structured entity holds the receivables and allocates the risks and rewards resulting
from these to T-Mobile and a bank on the basis of contractual arrangements.

The structured entity is financed through the issue of commercial paper to third parties outside
T-Mobile or, alternatively, through a credit facility provided by a bank. In one receivables portfolio, the
receivables are purchased in an automated process based on the purchase criteria set out in the
receivables purchase agreement. In another receivables portfolio, the structured entity has the freedom
to decide whether and which receivables will be purchased, though purchase of the agreed minimum
volume is imperative. T-Mobile is obligated to buy back aged receivables and receivables for which a
write-down is imminent at nominal value. The cash flows resulting from the buybacks would occur in
the month following the buy-back. Such buybacks of receivables would not affect the allocation of the
credit risk-related losses in any way, as the latter would be passed back to the buyers in line with the
agreed risk allocation. The nominal volume of the receivables sold by T-Mobile and not yet settled by
the debtors was EUR 127.8 million (2018: EUR 134 million) as of the reporting date. None of the
structured entities has business activities other than the purchase or sale of trade receivables or other
investments.

The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the sold receivables are based on the credit
risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). The maximum credit risk to be borne by T-Mobile
amounts to EUR 6.6 million (2018: EUR 7.4 million) as of the reporting date when translated into euros
and is largely attributable to transactions involving structured entities. The other credit risk-related
losses are borne by the buyers. The late-payment risk continues to be borne in full by T-Mobile. The
maximum exposure to loss for T-Mobile resulting from credit risk and late-payment risk relating to the
receivables sold at the reporting date is EUR 6.8 million (2018: EUR 7.6 million) and is largely

F-158


-----

attributable to transactions involving structured entities. Substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the receivables were neither transferred nor retained (allocation of the material risks and
rewards between T-Mobile and the buyers).

T-Mobile continues to perform servicing for the receivables sold. Under the factoring agreements in
which structured entities are engaged, buyers have the right to transfer the servicing to third parties for
no specific reason. Although T-Mobile is not authorized to use the receivables sold other than in its
capacity as servicer, it retains control over the receivables sold because the buyers and the structured
entities do not have the practical ability to resell the purchased receivables. At the time the receivables
are sold, the fair value of the expected losses is expensed. Expected future payments are presented
as a component of the associated liability. In transactions with structured entities, certain portions of
the purchase price are initially held back and, depending on the amount of the actual defaults, are only
paid to T-Mobile at a later date. To the extent that such portions of the purchase price are expected to
be received in the future, they are recognized at fair value. T-Mobile continues to recognize the trade
receivables sold to the extent of its continuing involvement, i.e., in the maximum amount with which it is
still liable for the credit risk and late-payment risk inherent in the receivables sold, and recognizes a
corresponding associated liability presented in liabilities to banks.

The receivables and the associated liability are then derecognized in the extent to which T-Mobile’s
continuing involvement is reduced (particularly when payment is made by the customer). The carrying
amount of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the extent to which the actual losses to be borne
by T-Mobile resulting from the credit risk and the late-payment risk exceed the losses initially expected.
This amount is recognized as an expense.

T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2019 amounted to EUR 6.6 million (2018: EUR
7.4 million), and the carrying amount of the associated liability was EUR 6.8 million (2018: EUR 7.6
million). T-Mobile presents the purchase price payments received from the buyers under cash
generated from operations where these relate to the derecognized portion of the receivables, and
under net cash from/used in financing activities where they relate to the portion of the receivables that
is still recognized. The volume of receivables sold was not subject to major fluctuations since the
beginning of the respective transaction.

**FINANCIAL COVENANTS**

The Company’s factoring agreements are subject to financial covenants. For two factoring agreements
the financial covenant consist of the tangible net worth ratio based on the audited annual consolidated
financial statements. The tangible net worth ratio shall be equal to or greater than 0.18 with the
tangible net worth being equal or greater than EUR 500 million. The tangible net worth ratio is
calculated as follows (A) divided by (B) whereas (A) is tangible net worth and (B) is balance sheet total.
Tangible net worth means share capital plus reserves (including retained earnings) plus minority
interests minus (plus (if a negative figure)) cash flow hedge reserve minus intangible assets (excluding
licenses). The balance sheet total means balance sheet total minus (plus (if a negative figure)) cash
flow hedge reserve) minus intangible assets (excluding licenses). Based on the audited annual
consolidated financial statements the tangible net worth ratio amounted to 0.21 in 2019 (2018: 0.23).

The tangible net worth amounted to EUR 841 million (2018: EUR 521 million). Consequently, the
financial covenant for the respective factoring agreements have been met for 2019 and 2018.

For another factoring agreement a different set of financial covenant applies. The financial covenant of
this factoring agreement is based on the Company’s unaudited quarterly financial statements for DT
group reporting purposes. The financial covenant is reported to the respective bank on a quarterly
basis.

The financial covenant for this factoring agreement consists of:

The intra-group funding is at least EUR 300 million,

The equity ratio may not fall below 20%, and

The leverage factor may not exceed 4.0.

The Company has met the financial covenant for all quarters during 2019 and 2018.

**37.** **SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

On 18 November 2019 the Executive Committee of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. approved the
process of divesting the business of InterNLnet. The transaction took place on 20 March 2020.
InterNLnet is part of the Business operating segment. The divestiture has limited impact on our
business: InterNLnet has approximately EUR 1M revenue on a yearly basis, 8 thousand customers
and 9.9 FTE.

On the 17[th] of March the Dutch Appeal Board for Trade and Industry (CBB) unexpectedly decided to
completely annul ACM’s WFA (market analysis Wholesale Fixed Assets) in full as according to the
CBB ACM did not sufficiently proof that there is a problem on the retail market negatively impacting
consumers and ACM in its greenfield approach did not appropriately take the voluntary wholesale
offers of KPN into account. This means that as of 17[th] of March 2020 KPN is no longer regulated and
required to grant access to its network against cost-oriented prices.

Since 31 December 2019, the spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted many local economies
around the globe. In many countries, businesses are being forced to cease or limit operations for long
or indefinite periods of time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, including travel bans,

F-161


-----

quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services have triggered significant
disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock markets have
also experienced great volatility and a significant weakening. Governments and central banks have
responded with monetary and fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions.

The Company determined that the current situation is considered to be a non-adjusting subsequent
event. Accordingly, the financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended
31 December 2019 have not been adjusted to reflect their impact. The duration and impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains
uncertain at this time.

Despite uncertainty over the impact of COVID-19 and consequences for our business, at this stage we
expect the impact of the virus to be limited. While we did adjust our latest forecast downwards, our
operating results and cash flows from operations to date have not been negatively affected compared
to 2019. As at the date of these financial statements, the company has a robust liquidity and revolving
credit facility headroom of EUR 100 million at Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V., and anticipates having
sufficient liquidity to fulfill and finance its ongoing operations for the foreseeable future.

In our view, the current assessment reflects management’s best estimate of the situation. We will
continue to follow the government policies and advice and in parallel will do our utmost to continue our
operations in the best and safest way possible without jeopardizing the health of our people and our
customers. With reference to section 2.8, whilst uncertain, we do not believe, however, that the impact
of the COVID-19 virus would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.

**37.1** **ACQUISITION OF SIMPEL.NL B.V.**

On 16 November 2020, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has approved
the acquisition of Complex Bidco B.V. and its 100% subsidiary Simpel.nl B.V. (Simpel) The effective
acquisition date was 1 December 2020.

Simpel is a Dutch mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) and sells sim-only subscriptions via its own
website. Simpel has approximately 1 million customers and approximately 20 employees. Simpel has
used the T-Mobile network as an MVNO since 2014.

With this acquisition, the combined number of mobile customers of the brands of T-Mobile Netherlands
will increase to approximately 6.6 million.

The acquisition of Simpel enables T-Mobile to further strengthen its position in the mobile market and
to continue to compete in a challenging sim-only market. This acquisition will also enable T-Mobile to
continue its market strategy as a challenger on the long term in all market segments and on all fronts.

At the time our 2019 financial statements are authorized for issue, the initial accounting for the
business combination is incomplete as the preliminary purchase price allocation performed by an
external party is not yet finalized. Therefore, no information is yet available regarding:

   - The goodwill to be recognized (qualitative nor quantitative). Regardless, none of the goodwill
is deductible for tax purposes.

   - The acquisition-date fair value of the total consideration transferred and the acquisition-date
fair value of each major class of consideration.

   - The contingent consideration arrangements, indemnification assets and the acquired
receivables.

   - The amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for each major class of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities recognized.

### The basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on
Auditing. We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section
‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

### Independence
We are independent of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. in accordance with the ‘Wet
toezicht accountantsorganisaties’ (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the ‘Verordening inzake
de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant
independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the
‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).

## Report on the other information included in the annual report

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report
contains other information that consists of:

- the management board report;

- the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code;

Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information:

- is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements;

- contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in
our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other
information contains material misstatements.

By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was
substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

The board of management is responsible for the preparation of the other information,
including the directors’ report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2
of the Dutch Civil Code.

## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

### Responsibilities of the board of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements

The board of management is responsible for:

- the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for

- such internal control as the board of management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board of management is
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the
financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the board of management should prepare the
financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the board of
management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so. The board of management should disclose events and
circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern in the financial statements.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

### Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to
obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our
objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute
level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may not detect all material misstatements.
Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation
of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.

## Appendix to our auditor’s report on the financial statements 2019 of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V.

In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report, we have further set out in this appendix
our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.

### The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism
throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements
and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:

- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.

- Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

- Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of management.

- Concluding on the appropriateness of the board of management’s use of the goingconcern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report and are made in the context of our
opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group
audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for
components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an
opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic
structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this
basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or
specific balances was considered necessary.

We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant

1 January 2018 IFRS 9 introduces new classification
and measurement requirements for
financial instruments and replaces,
in particular, IAS 39. The new
regulations cover the classification
of financial assets on the basis of
the underlying business models and
the cash flow characteristics of the
instruments. Under the new
provisions on the accounting of
impairment losses, expected losses
have to be recognized on initial
recognition. In addition, the
requirements apply not only to debt
instruments, but also to contract
assets pursuant to IFRS 15. Among
other things, the new rules for
reporting hedge relationships
provide the option of recognizing
hedging costs separately in other
comprehensive income (OCI).

1 January 2018 This standard provides a single,
principles-based five-step model for
the determination and recognition of
revenue to be applied to all
contracts with customers. It
replaces in particular IAS 18 and
IAS 11. When applying IFRS 15 for
the first time, an entity shall apply
the standard in full for the current
period. In respect of prior periods,
the transition guidance grants
entities an option to either apply
IFRS 15 in full to prior periods (with
certain limited practical expedients
being available) or to retain priorperiod figures as reported under the

standards.


The Group applied for the first time certain amendments to the standards, which are effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has not early adopted any standards,
interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective. The nature and the
impact of the amendments that have a material impact on the presentation of the Group’s result of
operations and financial positions are disclosed in this section.

**IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments:**

In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”. Application of this standard is mandatory
for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard introduces new classification
and measurement requirements for financial instruments and replaces, in particular, IAS 39.

The Group applies IFRS 9 prospectively, with an initial application date of 1 January 2018. The
cumulative effect arising from the transition is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of
equity in the year of initial application. TMNL has not restated the comparative information, which
continues to be reported under IAS 39.

Under IFRS 9, financial assets that are debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value
through profit or loss, amortized cost, or fair value through other comprehensive income. The
classification is based on two criteria: the Group’s business model for managing the assets; and
whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on
the principal amount outstanding.

F-178


-----

The assessment of the company’s business model was made as of the date of initial application,
1 January 2018. The assessment of whether contractual cash flows on debt instruments are solely
comprised of principal and interest was made based on the facts and circumstances as at the initial
recognition of the assets.

As described in Note 32.9, the Group is party to factoring agreements under which it sells portfolios its
trade receivables on a revolving basis. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group designated these
receivables as either at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or
loss. The measurement of debt instruments – especially trade receivables held for potential sale – at
fair value had minor effects at the transition date. Effects may arise in ongoing application, particularly
from changes in the volumes of receivables held for potential sale in the future.

The Group has not designated any financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss. There are
no changes in classification and measurement for the company’s financial liabilities.

The following table shows the effect of adopting IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2018 for each individual line item.

-----

Further, the adoption of IFRS 9 has changed the Group’s accounting for impairment losses for financial
assets by replacing IAS 39’s incurred loss approach with a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL)
approach. IFRS 9 requires the company to recognize an allowance for ECLs for all debt instruments
not held at fair value through profit or loss and contract assets.

The Group recognized additional impairment on the Company’s trade receivables of € 0.6 million and
which resulted in a decrease in equity as at 1 January 2018. Further, pursuant the initial application of
IFRS 15, the Group recorded a credit loss allowance on contract assets in the amount of € 1,2 million
as at 1 January 2018. Reference is made to Note 32.4 for additional information.

Effects may arise in ongoing application from a change in business developments (for example,
changes in volumes or prices) or from changes to business models where these are reflected in the
amounts reported for long term trade receivables and contract assets.

The Group has three types of financial assets that are subject to IFRS 9 new expected credit loss
model:

— Cash and cash equivalents

— Trade and other receivables

— Intercompany receivables

Cash and cash equivalents are considered to have a low impairment risk as these are current assets
valued at market value based on day-to-day exchange rates. No impairment risk is identified with
regard to cash and cash equivalents.

The trade receivables which are not factored are analyzed for the expected credit loss. The main
trigger for the expected credit loss is the default of the customer. To value this default risk T-Mobile
adjusts the valuation of the receivable for the average expected credit loss.

The expected credit loss on intercompany receivables is considered immaterial.

The following table depicts the reconciliation of the ending loss allowances in accordance with IAS 39
to the opening loss allowances as at 1 January 2018 determined in accordance with IFRS 9:

IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers:

In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. Application of the
standard is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. This standard
provides a single, principles-based five-step model for the determination and recognition of revenue to
be applied to all contracts with customers.

F-180


-----

It replaces, in particular, IAS 18 and IAS 11 and has a material effect on the presentation of the
Group’s results of operations and financial position. Depending on the business model applied, the
new provisions and the related changes in the accounting principles applied by the Group affect the
following issues in particular:

— In the case of multiple-element arrangements (e.g., mobile contract plus handset), the total
transaction price of the bundled contract is allocated among the individual, separate
performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices, i.e., based on a
ratio of the standalone selling price of each element to the aggregated standalone selling
prices of the contractual performance obligations. In contrast to the previous accounting
treatment, the relative standalone selling price of an individual element and thus the revenue
recognized for this unit of accounting is no longer limited to that proportion of the total
arrangement consideration to be provided by the customer, the payment of which does not
depend on the delivery of additional elements (contingent revenue cap). As a result, the
revenue to be recognized for products delivered in advance (e.g., mobile handsets) that are
sold at a subsidized price in combination with a long-term service contract was limited by this
subsidized price.

Under IFRS 15, this limitation no longer applies, i.e., in the case of subsidized products
delivered in advance, a larger portion of the total remuneration is attributable to the element
delivered in advance (mobile handset), requiring earlier recognition of revenue under the new
regulations. This leads to the recognition of what is known as a contract asset – a receivable
arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence – in the
statement of financial position. The contract asset is reduced over the remaining contract
period, lowering revenue from the other performance obligations (in this case: mobile service
revenues) compared with the amounts billed.

At the same time, it results in higher revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise and in
lower revenue from the provision of services.

— The extent of the changes resulting from the initial application of IFRS 15 that are described
above therefore largely depends on the business models used by the subsidiary in question.

— Customer activation fees and other advance one-time payments by the customer that do not
constitute consideration for a separate performance obligation are classified as contract
liabilities, and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the (remaining) contract period.

— Expenses for sales commissions (costs of obtaining a customer contract (contract costs))
must be capitalized and recognized over the estimated customer retention period. The
expenses are disclosed in the Group’s income statement, not under depreciation and
amortization but – depending on the sales channel – as goods and services purchased or
personnel costs.

— On first-time application of the standard, both total assets and shareholders’ equity increased
due to the capitalization of contract assets and contract costs for contracts not yet fully
completed.

— In cases where “material rights” are granted – such as offering additional discounts for future
purchases of further products – a portion of the transaction price must be deferred as a
contract liability and is not recognized as revenue until this additional performance obligation
has been satisfied or has lapsed.

— Contract liabilities (which, as deferred revenue, were already recognized as liabilities in the
past) must be netted against the contract assets for each customer contract.

— For the purposes of determining whether the Group sells products for its own account
(principal is gross revenue) or for the account of others (agent is net revenue), there are no
material changes for the existing agreements.

As regards IFRS 15, the Group utilizes the following accounting options:

— The Group applies the option for simplified initial application, limiting the retroactive
application of IFRS 15 to contracts that have not yet been completely fulfilled at the date of
initial application. The contracts that have not yet been completely fulfilled as of 1 January

F-181


-----

2018 are accounted for as if they had been recognized in accordance with IFRS 15 from the
very beginning. The cumulative effect arising from the transition is recognized as an
adjustment to the opening balance of equity in the year of initial application. Prior-year
comparatives are not adjusted; instead, the Group provides an explanation of the reasons for
the changes in items in the statement of financial position and the income statement for the
current period as a result of applying IFRS 15 for the first time.

— A significant financing component is not considered for the amount and timing of revenue
recognition if the period between when a promised good or service is transferred to the
customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.

The adjustments made to items in the statement of financial position as of 1 January 2018 and that are
affected by the first-time application of IFRS 15are as follows:

Carrying amounts as of 1 January 2018 are shown before impairment losses on contract assets
recognized in accordance with IFRS 9. Please refer to the explanations in regard to the initial
application of IFRS 9 in this section.

The remeasurement effects are mainly attributable to the first-time recognition of:

— Contract assets in the amount of EUR 47.0 million that, under IFRS 15, would have resulted
in the earlier recognition of revenue, in particular from the sale of goods and merchandise.

— Capitalized contract costs of EUR 45.5 million that, under IFRS 15, would have resulted in the
later recognition of selling expenses.

— Contract liabilities totaling EUR 1.9 million that, under IFRS 15, would have resulted in the
later recognition of revenue.

The deferred revenue of EUR 70.2 million recognized under trade and other payables as of
31 December 2017 is now recognized as contract liabilities in accordance with IFRS 15.

After current tax liabilities totaling EUR 22.2 million and other minor effects were taken into account,
the transition to the new standard as of 1 January 2018 resulted in a cumulative effect that increased
retained earnings by EUR 68.4 million.

Due to the transition to IFRS 15, contract assets are recognized for the first time and amortized, and
capitalized contract costs are recognized as assets for the first time and amortized.

Under IAS 18/IAS 11, other liabilities would have included deferred revenue, which, under IFRS 15, is
either recognized as contract liabilities or netted with contract assets.

The differences in the amounts recognized under deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
due to remeasurement effects in connection with the first-time and continuing application of IFRS 15 in
the 2018 financial year.

-----

Without the effect of IFRS 15, revenue would have amounted to EUR 1,347 million, EUR 26.6 million
higher than reported. Effects on revenue development are attributable mainly to amortization of the
contract assets/liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position over the (remaining) contract
period in the 2018 financial year. This amortization is recognized as a reduction or an increase in
revenue.

The subsidies are now no longer recognized as an expense, but as a reduction of the service revenues
over the contract term. Under other business models, revenue was increased due to the capitalization
and subsequent amortization of expenses for sales commissions (contract costs) under goods and
services purchased; these expenses were previously recognized as revenue-reducing effects.

The effects of IFRS 15 on costs for goods and services purchased resulted in EUR 11 million lower
costs. This effect is attributable to the capitalization of expenses for sales commissions, which, under
IAS 18/IAS 11, were recognized immediately in profit or loss either under goods and services
purchased (dealer commissions).

**2.3** **Consolidation methods**

**2.3.2** **Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control only exists if
an investor has the power over the investee, is exposed to variable returns, and is able to use power to
affect its amount of variable returns. The existence and effect of substantive potential voting rights that
are currently exercisable or convertible, including potential voting rights held by other group
companies, are considered when assessing whether an entity is controlled.

Income and expenses of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements from the
acquisition date. Income and expenses of a subsidiary remain included in the consolidated financial
statements until the date on which the parent ceases to control the subsidiary. If necessary, the
subsidiaries’ accounting principles are aligned with the uniform accounting principles applied by the the
Group. Intercompany income and expenses, receivables and liabilities, and profits or losses are
eliminated.

Upon loss of control, a gain or loss from the disposal of the subsidiary is recognized in the consolidated
income statement in the amount of the difference between the (I) proceeds from the disposal of the
subsidiary, the fair value of the remaining shares, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests,
and the cumulative amounts of other comprehensive income attributable to the subsidiary, and (II) the
carrying amount of the subsidiary’s net assets to be disposed of.

**2.3.3** **Business combinations**

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of
whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the
acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the:

    - fair values of the assets transferred

    - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business

    - equity interests issued by the Group

    - fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, and

    - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group
recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis
either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net
identifiable assets.

F-184


-----

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

The excess of the:

    - consideration transferred,

    - amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and

    - acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair
value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less
than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is
recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are
discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s
incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an
independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a
financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
profit or loss.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any
gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.

**2.4** **Foreign currencies**

**2.4.1** **Functional currency**

The consolidated financial statements are denominated in euros, the functional and reporting currency
of the Group. Items included in the financial statements of group companies are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective group company operates (the
functional currency).

**2.4.2** **Transactions, receivables and debts**

Foreign-currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the
date of transaction. At the reporting date, monetary items are translated at the closing rate, and
non-monetary items are translated at the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Exchange rate
differences are recognized in profit or loss.

**2.5** **Going concern**

The management of the Group has made an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern and is satisfied that the Group has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable
future. Furthermore, the Group is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant
doubts upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial
statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.

**2.6** **Estimates and assumptions**

The presentation of the results of operations or financial position in the consolidated financial
statements is dependent upon and sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions, and estimates.
The actual amounts may differ from those estimates.

The following critical accounting estimates and related assumptions and uncertainties inherent in
accounting policies applied are essential to understand the underlying financial reporting risks and the
effects that these accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties may have on the consolidated
financial statements.

F-185


-----

**2.6.1** **Impairments of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets**

The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets involves the
use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing, and amount of the impairment.
Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions,
expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the
future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services, current
replacement costs, prices paid in comparable transactions, and other changes in circumstances that
indicate an impairment exists.

The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows and the
determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant
judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows,
applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values. Specifically, the estimation of cash flows
underlying the fair values from the mobile business considers the continued investment in network
infrastructure required to generate future revenue growth through the offering of new data products and
services, for which only limited historical information on customer demand is available. If the demand
for these products and services does not materialize as expected, this would result in less revenue,
less cash flow, and potential impairment. When determining the fair values, additional planning
uncertainties are factored in that reflect the risks of macroeconomic development, which could
adversely affect future results of operations.

**2.6.2** **Depreciation and amortization of non-current assets**

Depreciation and amortization expenses are based on management estimates of useful life, residual
value and amortization method of property and equipment and intangible assets. Estimates may
change due to technological developments, competition, changes in market conditions and other
factors and may result in changes in the estimated useful life and in the amortization or depreciation
charges.

Technological developments are difficult to predict and our views on the trends and pace of
development may change over time. Some of the assets and technologies, in which T-Mobile invested
several years ago, are still in use and provide the basis for new technologies.

The useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed at least annually, taking
into consideration the factors mentioned above and all other relevant factors.

**2.6.3** **Determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit**

The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates
by management. Methods used to calculate the recoverable amount include discounted cash flowbased methods and methods that use market prices as a basis. The measurements on the basis of
discounted cash flows are founded on projections that are based on financial plans that have been
approved by management and are also used for internal purposes. The planning horizon selected
reflects the assumptions for short- to medium-term market developments and is selected to achieve a
steady state in the business outlook that is necessary for calculating the perpetual annuity.

This steady state is only reached based on the planning horizon selected, in particular due to the
sometimes long investment cycles in the telecommunications industry and the investments planned
and expected in the long run to acquire and extend the rights of spectrum use. Cash flows beyond the
internal mid-term planning are extrapolated using appropriate growth rates.

The key assumptions on which management has based its calculation of the recoverable amount
include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on
past experience as well as internal expectations, and that are underscored by external market data and
estimates: development of revenue, customer acquisition and retention costs, churn rates, capital
expenditure, market share, and growth rates. Discount rates are determined on the basis of external

F-186


-----

figures derived from the market, taking account of the risks associated with the cash-generating unit.
Any future changes in the aforementioned assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair
values of the cash-generating units.

**2.6.4** **Revenue recognition, contract assets and liabilities/contract costs**

The standalone selling prices of individual products or services that are part of multiple-element
arrangements are complex to determine, because some of the elements are price-sensitive and, thus,
volatile in a competitive marketplace. In many cases, standalone selling prices can also not be
observed for the company’s own products. Due to the fact that comparability is generally not
completely assured, the use of market prices for similar products is subject to an element of
uncertainty, as is an estimate using a cost-plus-margin approach. Changes in estimates of standalone
selling prices can significantly influence the allocation of the transaction price for the entire multipleelement arrangement among the individual performance obligations and therefore affect both the
financial position, i.e., the carrying amount of contract assets and contract liabilities, and the current
and future results of operations.

Contract costs are deferred and generally recognized as revenue over the expected duration of the
customer relationship. The estimate of the expected average duration of customer retention is based
on historical customer turnover. However, this is subject to fluctuations and has only limited informative
value with regard to future customer behavior, particularly if new products are rolled out. If
management’s estimates are revised, material differences may result in the amount and timing of
expenses for subsequent periods.

The significance of material rights is an estimate that is based on both quantitative and qualitative
factors. This is ultimately a matter of judgment, even though it is supported by quantitative facts.
Depending on the decision as to whether or not the customer has a material right to be deferred, there
may be material differences in the amount and timing of revenues for the current and subsequent
periods.

**2.7** **Critical judgments in applying accounting policies**

The following are the critical judgments, apart from those involving estimations, that the Group has
made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant
effect on the amounts recognized in financial statements:

**2.7.1** **Judgment in the classification of cash and cash equivalents**

The group exercises considerable judgment in the classification of their in-house cash pool balances
as cash equivalents. These in-house cash pool balances are managed within the Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTAG) group treasury function. The DTAG group treasury function operates as an in-house bank
which has similar characteristics as a regular bank. It maintains sufficient cash and liquid resources,
along with access to credit lines, to meet all inter-company obligations simultaneously. With respect to
DTAG’s liquidity risk, DTAG has met its targets for the liquidity reserve to cover at least the maturities
for the next 24 months in both 2017 and 2018. Deutsche Telekom had standardized bilateral credit
agreements with 22 banks for a total of EUR 12.9 billion as of 31 December 2018. As of 31 December
2018, EUR 0.6 billion of these credit lines had been utilized. The DTAG central treasury department is
responsible for the coordination of all intragroup cash and payment flows. The internal control
processes and procedures from the DTAG central treasury department are implemented and
monitored according to the minimum requirements set by the German Financial Market Authority,
where applicable.

The DTAG central treasury department monitors the balances of all companies that are part of the
central cash pooling and ensures sufficient funding of the respective balances.

In addition the company has direct access to these cash pool accounts and is entitled to terminate the
cash pooling agreement without notice for good reason.

F-187


-----

Management have therefore assessed that these balances are highly liquid instruments that are also
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

**2.7.2** **Judgments for the calculation of current and deferred taxes**

In the Dutch tax jurisdiction in which the Group operates, management must make judgments for the
calculation of current and deferred taxes. This is relevant, for example, when it comes to a decision on
the recognition of deferred tax assets because it must be probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which the deductible temporary differences, loss carryforwards, and tax credits can be utilized.

In addition to the estimate of future earnings, various factors are used to assess the probability of the
future utilization of deferred tax assets, including past results of operations, the reliability of planning,
and tax planning strategies. The period used for the assessment of the recoverability depends on the
circumstances at the respective group company and typically is in a range of 5 to 10 years.

**2.7.3** **Judgment in measuring and recognizing provisions and contingent liabilities**

The Group exercises considerable judgment in measuring and recognizing provisions and contingent
liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement,
mediation, arbitration, or government regulation. Judgment is necessary in assessing the likelihood
that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the final
settlement. Provisions are recognized for losses from executory contracts, provided a loss is
considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Because of the inherent uncertainties in this
evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. In addition,
significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to taxes and litigation risks.
These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the
support of internal specialists, if available, or with the support of outside consultants, such as actuaries
or legal counsel. Revisions to the estimates of these losses from executory contracts may significantly
affect future results of operations. For the Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) we had as a base the
costs results from the past and expectation of the future costs and discounted these amounts. The
provision has a period lifetime equal to the lifetime of the network license.

**2.7.4** **Disclosure of assets and liabilities T-Mobile Infra B.V.**

Following the decision to distribute T-Mobile Infra B.V. to the shareholders of the Group, management
have assessed whether this would meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. As
the contribution of T-Mobile Infra B.V. to the Group is less than 5% of turnover and approximately 6%
of total assets, management have concluded that it does not represent a separate major line of
business or component of the Company so it should not be presented as a discontinued operation. The
T-Mobile Infra B.V. assets and liabilities have been presented in the financial statements as held for
distribution to owners.

**2.7.5** **Revenue recognition, contract assets and liabilities/contract costs**

One-time payments by the customer for contracts that can be terminated at any time are recognized
over an expected contract period, the length of which depends on the period over which the customer
is likely from a commercial perspective to renew or not terminate the contract on a monthly basis.

Gross versus net presentation: The assessment of whether the Group presents revenue gross as the
principal or net after deduction of costs as the agent, i.e., only in the amount of the remaining margin,
requires an analysis of both the legal form and the substance of con-tracts. After all of the relevant
facts and circumstances of the individual case have been weighed up, in many cases the decision also
involves a degree of discretion, even if a uniform Group method of assessment is applied. Depending
on the conclusion reached, there may be material differences in the amounts of revenues and
expenses for the current and subsequent periods. This has no bearing on profit/loss from operations,
however.

The material principles on recognition and measurement outlined below were applied uniformly to all
accounting periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.

**2.8.1** **Intangible assets (excluding goodwill)**

Intangible assets with finite useful lives, including UMTS and LTE licenses and software, are measured
at cost and generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Such assets are
impaired if their recoverable amount, which is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and value in use, is lower than the carrying amount.

The useful lives and the amortization methods of the assets are reviewed at least at each financial
year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as
changes in accounting estimates in accordance with IAS 8. Amortization of mobile communications
licenses begins as soon as the related network is ready for use. The useful lives of mobile
communications licenses are determined based on several factors, including the term of the licenses
granted by the respective regulatory body in each country, the availability and expected cost of
renewing the licenses, as well as the development of future technologies.

The useful lives of the Group most important mobile communications licenses and software is as
follows:

**Years:**

Licenses (3G/4G/5G) . . . . . . . . . . 16-17
LTE Licenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11-15 (20 after extension)
Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2

Expenditures for intangible assets incurred during the development phase are capitalized if they meet
the criteria for recognition as assets, and are amortized over their useful lives. Research expenditures
are expensed as incurred. Development is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a
plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products,
processes, systems, or services prior to the commencement of commercial production or use.
Examples of activities typically included in development are the design, construction, and testing of
pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models involving new technology.

The development phase is deemed complete when the IT department has formally documented that
the capitalized asset is ready for its intended use.

**2.8.2** **Goodwill**

Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment based on the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the goodwill is allocated (impairment-only approach). The impairment test is
carried out on a regular basis at the end of each financial year, as well as whenever there are
indications that the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is impaired.

**2.8.3** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less straight-line depreciation, and impairment losses,
if applicable. The depreciation period is based on the expected useful life of the assets. Items of
property, plant and equipment are depreciated pro rata temporis in the year of acquisition. The residual
values, useful lives, and the depreciation methods of the assets are reviewed at least at each financial
year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as
changes in accounting estimates in accordance with IAS 8.

In addition to directly attributable costs, the costs of internally developed assets include proportionate
indirect material and labor costs, as well as administrative expenses relating to production or the
provision of services. In addition to the purchase price and costs directly attributable to bringing the
asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended
by management, costs also include the estimated costs for dismantling and removing the asset, and

F-190


-----

restoring the site on which it is located. If an item of property, plant and equipment consists of several
components with different estimated useful lives, those components that are significant are depreciated
over their individual useful lives.

Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Public investment grants reduce the cost of
the assets for which the grants were made.

On disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal, the carrying amount of the item is derecognized. The gain or loss
arising from the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net
disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item and is recognized as other operating
income or other operating expenses when the item is derecognized.

The useful lives of material asset categories are presented in the following table:

**Years:**

Installations, machinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-8
Other non-current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5
Leasehold improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or applicable lease
terms.

**2.8.4** **Borrowing costs**

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a
qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. The Group defines qualifying assets as
construction projects or other as- sets for which a period of at least twelve months is necessary in
order to get them ready for their intended use or sale.

**2.8.5** **Impairments of intangible assets (including goodwill) and items of property, plant and**
**equipment**

Impairments are identified by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount. If individual
assets do not generate future cash flows independently of other assets, recoverability is assessed on
the basis of the cash-generating unit to which the assets can be allocated. At each reporting date, the
Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit must be determined. In addition,
annual impairment tests are carried out for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill) at a
yearly basis.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each
of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the
carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable
amount, goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit must be reduced in the amount of the
difference. Impairment losses for goodwill must not be reversed. If the impairment loss recognized for
the cash-generating unit exceeds the carrying amount of the allocated goodwill, the additional amount
of the impairment loss is to be distributed on a pro-rata basis to the assets allocated to the cashgenerating unit. The fair values or values in use (if measurable) of the individual assets shall be
considered to be the minimum values. If the reasons for previously recognized impairments no longer
exist, the impairment losses on the assets concerned (with the exception of goodwill) must be
reversed.

The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and the value in use. The recoverable amount is generally determined by means of a
discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation, unless it can be determined on the basis of a market price.
These DCF calculations use projections that are based on financial budgets approved by management
covering a ten-year period and are also used for internal purposes. The planning horizon reflects the

F-191


-----

assumptions for short- to mid-term market developments. Cash flows beyond the ten-year period are
extrapolated using appropriate growth rates. For the key assumptions on which management has
based its calculation of the recoverable amount, please refer to Note 2.6.3.

**2.8.6** **Inventories**

Inventories are carried at cost on initial recognition and are subsequently measured at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is measured using the
weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is the estimated standalone selling price in the
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the necessary estimated selling
expenses.

**2.8.7** **Assets classified as held for distribution to owners**

Assets (or disposal groups) and liabilities are classified as held for distribution to owners when the
entity is committed to distribute the asset to the owners. For this to be the case, the assets and
liabilities must be available for immediate distribution in their present condition and the distribution
must be highly probable. For the distribution to be highly probable, actions to complete the distribution
must have been initiated and should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of
classification. Actions required to complete the distribution should indicate that it is unlikely that
significant changes to the distribution will be made or that the distribution will be withdrawn.

Those assets and related liabilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to distribute, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee
benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights
under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal
group) to fair value less costs to distribute. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair
value less costs to distribute of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative
impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the
distribution of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.

Assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they
are classified as held for distribution to owners. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities
of a disposal group classified as held for distribution to owners continue to be recognised.

Assets classified as held for distribution to owners and the assets of a disposal group classified as held
for distribution to owners are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for distribution to owners are presented separately from
other liabilities in the balance sheet.

**2.8.8** **Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits**

T-Mobile Netherlands Retail B.V. employees who work in the shops participate in the defined benefit
scheme financed with a collective fixed annual premium with the industry-wide pension fund for the
retail industry. T-Mobile accounts for the defined benefit scheme with the industry-wide pension fund
for the retail industry as though it was a defined contribution scheme. In the event of a deficit at the
industry-wide pension fund, the Group has no obligation to pay supplementary contributions.

The pension fund carries an indexed career average pension scheme. These defined benefit plans are
recognized as defined contribution plans because the funds accounts are not designed to be able to
identify the part of the pension liabilities and assets belonging to T-Mobile. T-Mobile is obliged to pay a
pre-agreed contribution to these plan. T-Mobile is not entitled to any surplus and is not liable for any
deficit, except by future adjustments to the contribution rates.

F-192


-----

The actual coverage ratio of Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Detailhandel at 31 December
2018 was 106.5%, a decrease of 4.6% compared to 31 December 2017.

Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Detailhandel is a multiemployer plan because a collectively
bargained plan is maintained by more than one employer within the same industry. At the end of 2018
there were 32,000 employers participating in the pension fund. T-Mobile is one of the many
participants in this pension fund and our exposure is limited. The expected contribution for 2018 is
EUR 1,152 thousand.

**2.8.9** **Other provisions**

Other provisions are recognized for current legal or constructive obligations to third parties that are
uncertain with regard to their timing or their amount. Provisions are recognized for these obligations
provided they relate to past transactions or events, will probably require an outflow of resources to
settle, and this outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions are carried at their expected settlement
amount, taking into account all identifiable risks and uncertainties.

The settlement amount is calculated on the basis of a best estimate; suitable estimation methods and
sources of information are used depending on the characteristics of the obligation. In case of a number
of similar obligations, the Group of obligations is treated as one single obligation. The expected value
method is used as the estimation method.

If there is a range of potential events with the same probability of occurrence, the average value is
taken. Individual obligations (e.g., legal and litigation risks) are regularly evaluated based on the most
probable outcome, provided an exceptional probability distribution does not mean that other estimates
would lead to a more appropriate evaluation. The measurement of provisions is based on past
experience, current costing and price information, as well as estimates and reports from experts.
If experience or current costing or price information is used to determine the settlement amount, these
values are extrapolated to the expected settlement date. Suitable price trend indicators (e.g.,
construction price indexes or inflation rates) are used for this purpose.

Provisions are discounted when the effect of the time value of money is material. Provisions are
discounted using pre-tax market interest rates that reflect the term of the obligation and the risk
associated with it (insofar as not already taken into consideration in the calculation of the settlement
amount). Reimbursement claims are not netted against provisions; they are recognized separately as
soon as their realization is virtually certain.

Provisions for decommissioning, restoration, and similar obligations arising from the acquisition of
property, plant and equipment are offset by a corresponding increase in the capitalized cost of the
relevant asset. Changes at a later date in estimates of the amount or timing of payments or changes to
the interest rate applied in measuring such obligations also result in retrospective increases or
decreases in the carrying amount of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. These in turn
change the depreciation of the asset to be recognized in the future, which leads to the changes in
estimates being recognized in profit or loss over the remaining useful life.

Where the decrease in the amount of a provision exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset, the
excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**2.8.10** **Financial instruments**

Financial instruments are recognized as soon as The Group becomes a party to the contractual
regulations of the financial instrument. For regular purchases or sales, the settlement date is relevant
for the initial recognition and derecognition. This is the day on which the asset is delivered to or by The
Group. In general, financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in
the statement of financial position when, and only when, the entity currently has a right to offset the
recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis.

F-193


-----

Transferred financial assets are derecognized in full if substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred or if some of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred (risk
sharing) and the acquirer has both the legal and the practical ability to sell the assets to a third party. If,
in cases where risk is shared, the acquirer is unable to sell the assets to a third party, the assets will
continue to be recognized to the extent of the maximum risk retained. Financial liabilities are
derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract expires or if there is a substantial
modification of the terms of the contract.

**Financial assets**

Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, originated loans and other
receivables. In Note 2.8.11 the accounting policies on financial assets have been disclosed.

**Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities include financial liabilities that are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost.
In Note 2.8.12 the accounting policies on financial assets have been disclosed.

**2.8.11** **Financial assets**

**Initial recognition and measurement**

Financial assets are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. For all financial assets not
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to
the acquisition are taken into account plus, in the case of debt instruments, a loss account for expected
credit losses. The fair values recognized in the statement of financial position are generally based on
market prices of the financial assets. If these are not available, the fair value is determined using
standard valuation models on the basis of current market parameters.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual
cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. In order for a financial
asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive
income, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on
the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at
an instrument level.

The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets
in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from
collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.

**Subsequent measurement**

The Group has only financial assets that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables and originated loans and other receivables. The measurement of these financial assets are
described below:

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash accounts and short-term cash deposits at banks; they have
maturities of up to three months at initial recognition.

**_Trade receivables and originated loans and other receivables_**

Trade receivables and originated loans and other receivables are measured at their transaction price at
initial recognition if they do not contain a significant financing component. Instruments with a significant
financing component are initially measured at fair value.

F-194


-----

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured depending on the
underlying business model at amortized cost, less impairment, fair value through other comprehensive
income or fair value through profit or loss.

Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or
costs.

For more information on receivables, reference is made to Note 2.2. Changes in accounting Policies
and Note 5 Trade Receivables.

**Derecognition**

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial
assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated statement of financial
position) when:

    - The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired

Or

    - The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a
‘pass-through arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the
asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to
the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability.
The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and
obligations that the Group has retained.

**Impairment of financial assets**

The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held
at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash
flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive,
discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will
include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the
contractual terms.

In calculating ECLs, the group applies a simplified approach. Therefore, the Group does not track
changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each
reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic
environment.

**2.8.12** **Financial liabilities**

**Initial recognition and measurement**

Financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition. For all financial liabilities not
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to
the acquisition are also a component of the carrying amount. If the contractual payment term for
liabilities to suppliers is longer than the normal credit period in the relevant procurement market at this
point in time, this liability is reported under other interest-bearing liabilities in financial liabilities instead
of under trade payables. A financing agreement of this nature is shown as a non-cash transaction in

F-195


-----

the statement of cash flows and the relevant repayment of the financial liability reported under net cash
from/used in financing activities. This applies regard- less of whether the supplier sells its receivable or
not.

**Subsequent measurement**

The Group has only financial liabilities that are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost
(FLAC).

The measurement of financial liabilities at amortized cost are described below:

**_Financial liabilities at amortized cost_**

Loans and borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the consolidated income statement and
other comprehensive income over the period of the loan using the effective interest method.

**Derecognition**

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an
exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a
new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the consolidated
income statement.

**2.8.13** **Determination of fair value**

The fair value of financial instruments not listed in an active market, is determined by using appropriate
valuation techniques. Valuation techniques include net present value techniques, comparison to similar
instruments for which market observable prices exist, options pricing models and other relevant
valuation models. Any difference noted between the fair value and the transaction price is treated as
expense or income, unless it qualifies for recognition as some type of asset or liability.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are
categorized within the fair value hierarchy. This is described, as follows, based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

    - Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities

    - Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly observable

    - Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable

**2.8.14** **Contingencies (contingent liabilities and assets)**

Contingencies (contingent liabilities and assets) are potential liabilities or assets arising from past
events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more
uncertain future events not entirely within the control of the Group. Contingent liabilities are also
present obligations that arise from past events for which an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits is not probable or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient
reliability. Contingent liabilities are only recognized at their fair value if they were assumed in the
course of a business combination.

F-196


-----

Contingent liabilities not assumed in the course of a business combination are not recognized.
Contingent assets are not recognized. However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then
the related asset is no longer a contingent asset, but it is recognized as an asset. Information on
contingent liabilities is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless the
possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. The same applies to
contingent assets where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

**2.8.15** **Leases**

Beneficial ownership of leased assets is attributed to the contracting party in the lease to which the
substantial risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset are transferred.

If substantially all risks and rewards are attributable to the lessor (operating lease), the leased asset is
recognized in the statement of financial position by the lessor. Measurement of the leased asset is then
based on the accounting policies applicable to that asset. The lease payments are recognized in profit
or loss by the lessor. The lessee in an operating lease recognizes the lease payments made during the
term of the lease in profit or loss. Contractually defined future changes in the lease payments during
the term of the lease are recognized on a straight-line basis over the entire lease term, which is defined
only once at the inception date of the contract.

Where extension options exist, the exercise of those extension options that are reasonably certain is
initially taken into account at the time the lease is concluded. If the original assessment of the exercise
of extension options changes in the course of the lease, the estimated future obligations arising from
operating leases will be changed accordingly.

If a sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease, any excess of sales proceeds over the
carrying amount is deferred and amortized over the lease term.

**2.8.16** **Share-based payment programs**

Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at fair value on the grant date. The fair
value of the obligation is recognized as personnel costs over the vesting period and offset against
capital reserves. For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods and services acquired
and the liability incurred have to be recognized at the fair value of the liability. The fair value of the
liability has to be newly determined at each reporting date and at the settlement date, and the changes
in the fair value have to be recognized in profit and loss, until the liability is settled.

**2.8.17** **Net revenue, contract assets, contract liabilities and capitalized contract costs**

Net revenues include all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Group. Ordinary activities
refer to the core business and to other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services.

Revenues are recorded net of value-added tax and other taxes collected from customers. Value-added
tax and other taxes collected are remitted to governmental authorities.

Net revenues are recognized in accordance with the provision of goods or services, provided that
collectability of the consideration is probable. For service contracts with a continuous service provision,
the contractually agreed total consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the
minimum contract term, regardless of the payment pattern.

A contract asset must be recognized if the Group recorded revenue for fulfilment of a contractual
performance obligation before the customer paid consideration or before – irrespective of when
payment is due – the requirements for billing and thus the recognition of a receivable exist.

A contract liability must be recognized when the customer paid consideration or a receivable from the
customer is due before the Group fulfilled a contractual performance obligation and thus recognized
revenue. In a customer contract, contract liabilities must be set off against contract assets.

Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services must
be separated into distinct performance obligations, each with its own separate revenue contribution

F-197


-----

that is recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the customer. In the Group, this
especially concerns the sale of a mobile handset or other telecommunications equipment combined
with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed-network telecommunications contract. The total transaction
price of the bundled contract is allocated among the individual performance obligations based on their
relative – possibly estimated – standalone selling prices, i.e., based on a ratio of the standalone selling
price of each separate element to the aggregated standalone selling prices of the contractual
performance obligations.

As a result, the revenue to be recognized for products (often delivered in advance) such as mobile
handsets that are sold in combination with a long-term service contract is higher than the amount billed
or collected.

This leads to the recognition of what is known as a contract asset – a receivable arising from the
customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence – in the statement of financial position.
The contract asset is reversed and reduced over the remaining minimum contract period, lowering
revenue from the other performance obligations (in this case: mobile service revenues) compared with
the amounts billed. In contrast to the amounts billed, this results in higher revenue from the sale of
goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the provision of services.

As distinct from promotional offers, options to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or
at a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is
deferred as a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires, providing the discount on future
purchases is an implicit component of the consideration for the current contract and is also significant.
The measure of significance is whether the decision by the (average) customer to enter into the current
contract is likely to have been significantly influenced by their right to the future discount. Offers for
volume discounts for the purchase of additional core products of an entity (e.g., a discount offered on
an additional fixed-network contract for mobile customers) are classed by the Group as promotional
offers to be excluded from consideration.

Long-term customer receivables (e.g., arising from sales of handsets in instalments), contract assets
(in connection with the conclusion of a long-term customer contract) or contract liabilities (e.g., arising
from a prepayment by the customer) are recognized at present value if the financing component is
significant in relation to the total contract value (i.e., including those performance obligations that do
not contain a financing component). The discount rate also reflects the customer credit risk. The Group
makes use of the option not to recognize a significant financing component if the period between when
a good or service is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service
will be one year or less.

Payments to customers including credits or subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in
revenue unless the payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service from the customer,
for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated.

Gross versus net presentation: In cases where a company is in an intermediary position between
another supplier/vendor (e.g., manufacturer, wholesaler) and a retail customer, it must be assessed
whether the company itself supplies the relevant product or provides the service requested by the
customer as the principal or whether the company merely acts as the agent for the supplier. The
outcome determines whether the entity can recognize revenue on a gross basis (as the principal) or on
a net basis after deducting the costs to the supplier (as the agent). For the Group, the question arises
particularly in the case of digital services (e.g., streaming services) purchased from third parties and
sold to retail customers as part of the Group’s product portfolio.

In summary, in case of rights to another party’s goods or services, the Group considers itself to be the
principal vis-à-vis the retail customer if all of the following conditions are met and thus reports gross
revenues:

    - The Group either has a contractual enforceable right to receive the predefined services “on
demand” at predefined (fixed or variable) prices, and accordingly the other party has entered
into an enforceable ongoing commitment to provide them, or the Group has entered into a
material minimum purchase commitment.

F-198


-----

    - The Group sells access to the other party’s services in its own name and for its own account
under a contract between the Group and the retail customer.

    - The Group has discretion in setting the price for the other party’s services sold for its own
account.

Contract costs comprise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commissions paid
to employees in the direct sales channel and third-party retailers in the indirect sales channel) and the
costs to fulfil a contract. These must be capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be
compensated by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are
additional costs that would have not been incur-red had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfil
a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve
the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be capitalized under
any other standard. The Group makes use of the option to immediately recognize contract costs whose
amortization period would be less than one year as an expense.

The capitalized contract costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
customer retention period. The expenses are disclosed in the Group’s income statement, not under
depreciation and amortization but – depending on the sales channel – as goods and services
purchased or personnel costs.

In the indirect sales channel, third-party retailers often arrange service contracts on behalf of and for
the account of the Group (as the agent) in connection with the sale of subsidized handsets in their own
name and for their own account (as the principal). In such cases, the third-party retailer receives
handset compensation for an amount equal to the long term handset loan the Group has engaged
directly with the end-customer.

In the case of multiple-element arrangements in the direct sales channel for business customers, the
customer ultimately covers the handset subsidy by paying a price above the stand-alone selling price
for the service contract. The Group considers this an implicit promise to the business customer that on
conclusion of this service contract they will be able to purchase a handset at a discounted price.

Depending on the business model, revenue recognition at the Group is as follows:

The mobile and fixed-network business includes mobile services, narrow- and broadband access to the
fixed network and the internet, television via internet, connection and roaming fees billed to other
mobile operators (wholesale business), sales, other telecommunications equipment and accessories.
Revenue generated from the use of voice and data communications as well as television via internet is
recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. The services rendered relate to use by customers
(e.g., call minutes), availability over time (e.g., monthly flat rates), or other agreed rate plans. Revenue
and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are
recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled company obligations that
affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement.

Trade-in rights for used handsets which are granted to customers upon contract conclusion under the
condition of a new purchase transaction (including renewal of an existing service contract) do not
constitute repurchase arrangements; however, if the repurchase prices exceed the fair value of the
handsets these rights must be recognized as separate performance obligations for which part of the
contractual revenue is deferred until they are exercised or expire.

Particularly in the mobile communications business, the timing of payments for mobile handsets
purchased in connection with the conclusion of a service contract differs from the timing of the delivery
and hence from revenue recognition. Where a significant financing component exists, revenue is
measured at the present value. In case of a sale of handsets in connection with the conclusion of
service contracts in the consumer business, the payment-by-instalment model is offered to customers.
In the payment-by-instalment model, ahandset loan must thus be carried at the date of revenue
recognition which is generally repaid over a 24-month service contract term through payments made
by the customer.

F-199


-----

**2.8.18** **Employee benefits**

**Stock appreciation rights**

Liabilities for the Group’s share appreciation rights are recognised as employee benefit expense over
the relevant service period. The liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date and are
presented as employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.

**Other short-term employee’s benefits**

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as
the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under shortterm liabilities if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result
of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably.

**2.8.19** **Income taxes**

Income taxes has included current income taxes as well as deferred taxes. Current and deferred tax
assets and liabilities must be recognized where they are probable. They are measured in accordance
with the tax laws applicable or already announced as of the reporting date, provided said
announcement has the effect of actual enactment.

Where current and deferred tax is recognized, it must be reported as income or expense except to the
extent that the tax arises from a transaction which is recognized outside profit and loss, either in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, or in connection with a business combination. Current tax
assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset in the
statement of financial position if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets
against current tax liabilities, has an intention to settle net, and the deferred tax assets and the
deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities must be recognized in the amount that the Group expects
to settle or recover from the tax authorities. They include liabilities/receivables for the current period as
well as for prior periods.

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the
consolidated statement of financial position and the tax base, as well as for tax loss carryforwards and
tax credits.

By way of derogation from this principle, a deferred tax liability is not recognized for temporary
differences if the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a
transaction which is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither
accounting profit nor taxable profit/tax loss. A deferred tax liability is not recognized either for
temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill.

A deferred tax liability is generally recognized for temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, joint arrangements, and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.

**Pronounce-**
**ment** **Title**


**To be applied**
**from** **Changes**


IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRS 16 principally requires
lessees to recognize assets
and liabilities for all leases
and the rights and
obligations associated with
these leases in the
statement of financial
position. Going forward,
lessees will therefore no
longer be required to make
the distinction between
finance and operating
leases that was required in
the past in accordance with
IAS 17. For all leases, the
lessee will recognize a
lease liability in its
statement of financial
position for the obligation to
make future lease
payments. At the same
time, the lessee will
capitalize a right of use to
the underlying asset which
is equivalent to the present
value of the future lease
payments plus initial direct
costs, directly attributable
expenditure, advance
payments and restoration
costs, as well as less
incentive payments
received. Similar to the
guidance on finance leases
in IAS 17, the lease liability
will be adjusted over the
lease term for any
remeasurement, while the
right-of-use asset will be
depreciated, which in
contrast to the current lease
expense normally leads to
higher expenses at the
inception date of a lease.
For the lessor, on the other
hand, the provisions of the
new standard are similar to
the existing guidance in IAS
17. IFRS 16 also includes
new provisions on the
definition of a lease and its
presentation, on
disclosures in the notes,
and on sale and leaseback
transactions.

No material impact.


In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 “Leases.” The standard will be effective for the first time for
financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 has a material effect on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements, particularly on total assets and liabilities, the results of operations,
cash generated from operations, and the presentation of the financial position.

The new regulations affects the Group as a lessee especially in relation to leases of cell sites (land,
space in cell towers or rooftop surface areas), network infrastructure, and buildings used for
administrative or technical purposes.

The Group will not apply the new lease standard retrospectively in full, but will make use of the
exemption provisions for lessees, also known as the modified retrospective method. On the transition
to IFRS 16, payment obligations from existing operating leases will be discounted using the relevant
incremental borrowing rate and recognized as a lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate of
interest is determined by deriving benchmark interest rates for a period of up to 30 years from maturityrelated risk-free interest rates which are increased by a credit-risk premium and adjusted for a liquidity
and country-risk premium. Weighted average incremental borrowing rates of 1.1 to 3.5 percent were
applied to lease liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position as of 1 January 2019. The
lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily
determined, which is generally the case for leases in the group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing
rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary
to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with
similar terms, security and conditions. The right-of-use assets will be carried in the amount of the lease
liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments. Due among other things to
the significant amount of liabilities from straight-line leases in accordance with IAS 17, which in
accordance with IFRS 16 must be deducted from the right-of-use assets, as of 1 January 2019 the
right-of-use assets under IFRS 16 must be carried at a lower amount than the corresponding lease
liability.

In the statement of cash flows, the repayment portion of the lease payments from existing operating
leases will reduce net cash from/used in financing activities and no longer affect net cash from
operating activities. Only the interest payments will remain in net cash from operating activities, the
total of which will rise.

    - The Group’s transition to the new IFRS 16 standard has the following material effects as of
1 January 2019:The increase in total assets from the right of use of assets (without T-Mobile
Infra B.V.) amounts to EUR 206.3. The increase in lease liabilities (without T-Mobile Infra
B.V.) amounts to EUR 214.8 million.

F-203


-----

    - The impact of T-Mobile Infra B.V. on the right-of-use assets is an increase of EUR 102.8
milion. The lease liabilities increase by EUR 103.4 milion. The total increase for the right of
use amounts to EUR 309.1 million. The total increase in lease liabilities amounts to EUR
318.2 million.

    - The operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 are EUR 291 milion and the
adjustments resulting from discounting is EUR 56.1 milion.

    - Going forward and related to, depreciation charges are EUR 30 million to EUR 40 million
higher and interest expense are EUR 3.5 million to EUR 4.5 million higher and will be reported
in the consolidated income statement instead of lease expense.

    - T-Mobile Infra B.V. charges yearly costs in the amount of EUR 52 million to T-Mobile. The
costs are recognised as intercompany charges from related parties. T-Mobile has a
non-cancelable contract term with T-Mobile Infra B.V. of 15 years.

Significant options and expedients will be exercised as follows:

    - Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities will be reported separately in the statement of
financial position.

    - The recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements of IFRS 16 will also apply to
short-term leases and leases based on low-value assets.

    - In leases that contain both lease components and non-lease components, a distinction will not
be made between these components. Each lease component will be accounted for – as a
lease – in conjunction with other related performance components.

    - Leases for intangible assets fall under IAS 38 rather than under IFRS 16.

In addition, on the date of first-time adoption of IFRS 16, use will be made of the following options and
expedients:

    - Provisions for onerous contracts recognized in connection with leases will be derecognized on
1 January 2019 against the right-of-use asset. Onerous contracts have not been identified by
the Group.

In determining the lease term, hindsight may be used where this provides a better estimate for the
exercise of options to extend or terminate the lease. In general the shortest legal lease term will be
determined and used as a lease term.

The obligations arising from operating leases as of 31 December 2018 gave rise to the following

Of the total of trade receivables, EUR 75.4 million (31 December 2017: EUR 74.3 million) is due over
one year. These non-current receivable balance relate to the long term portion of handset loans that
are provided to customers and are to be repaid in monthly installments over a period of not more than
24 months. The interest percentage for all loans is 1.16 % per annum (31 December 2017: 1.16 %).
With respect to the trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there were no indications
as of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations. All impaired and
overdue balances are fully provided for.

As per 31 December 2018 credit loss allowance amount to EUR 50.3 million (31 December 2017: EUR
27.4 milion). Reference is made to Note 32.4 for additional information.

Due to the short-term nature of the trade receivables, their carrying amount approximates their fair
value. For non-current receivables, their carrying amount approximates their fair value as well.

T-Mobile is party to factoring agreements under which it sells trade receivables on a revolving basis.
The carrying amounts of the trade receivables include receivables which are subject to such factoring
agreements. Under these factoring agreements T-Mobile has transferred the relevant receivables to
banks in exchange for cash. T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2018 amounted to
EUR 22 million. Further reference is made to the notes 32.9 Transfer of assets (factoring of

short-term nature of the other receivables, their carrying amount approximates their fair value.

As at 31 December 2018 and 2017, no loss allowance for receivables from group companies was
recorded, as the expected credit loss on intragroup receivables is immaterial.

**6** **Contract assets**

Following the transition to IFRS 15, a remeasurement effect of EUR 47.0 million was recognized
directly in equity as of 1 January 2018 in relation to the initial recognition of contract assets. Under
IFRS 15, these would have led to the earlier recognition of revenue, in particular from the sale of goods
and merchandise. For more information on the new accounting standards, please refer to the Note 2.2.

**10.1** **Software**

Software consists of internally generated software and external purchased software. Of the total
amount of capitalized software, EUR 56.2 million is internally generated software (31 December 2017:
EUR 53.1 million).

**10.2** **Goodwill**

**Goodwill impairment test**

The impairment test for the goodwill was performed for the ending balance of the current period
(31 December 2018). The Board of Management of T-Mobile is deemed to be the Chief Operating
Decision Maker. The board reviews the results of the company as a whole in order to assess the
performance of the business and to make capital allocation decisions. The annual impairment test for
the goodwill as of 31 December 2018 did not identify a need for impairment.

The recoverable amounts to be identified for the impairment test were largely determined on the basis
of the fair value less costs of disposal. These figures were calculated using a net present value
approach. The main parameters are shown in the table on the next page. Input for the calculations fo
the recoverable amounts are the ten-year business planning projections, which are based on financial
plans that have been approved by management and are also used for internal management purposes.

The key assumptions on which management has based its determination of the recoverable amount
include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on
past experience and extended to include internal expectations, and that are underscored by external
market data and estimates:

    - development of revenue,

    - customer acquisition and retention costs,

    - churn rates,

    - capital expenditure,

F-208


-----

    - market share, and

    - growth rates.

Discount rates are determined on the basis of external figures derived from the market, taking account
of the market and country risks associated with the cash-generating unit. Changes in the assumptions
may have a negative impact, as a result of future macro economic trends, continued intense
competition, further possible legislation changes (e.g., as part of national austerity programs), and
regulatory intervention.The following tables provide an overview of the main factors affecting the
measurement. Considering that the goodwill impairment resulted in a significant headroom of the fair
value less cost to dispose as compared to the carrying value, no sensitivity analysis is included.

management’s expectations of market
development.

Sales price Average annual growth rate over the ten-year
forecast period; based on current industry trends
and including long term inflation forecasts for
each territory.

EBITDA margin Based on past performance and management’s
expectations for the future.

Sustainable Growth rate This is the weighted average growth rate used to
extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget
period. The rates are consistent with forecasts
included in industry reports.

Annual capital expenditure Expected cash costs in the CGU. This is based
on the historical experience of management.

**10.3** **Other intangibles**

Other intangibles primarily consist of customer relationships and favorable contracts identified at the
acquisition of Orange.

**10.4** **Assets under construction**

Depending on the nature of the specific project, assets under construction (AUC) are either presented
under intangible assets or property, plant or equipment. AUC in the table above mainly represent
projects associated with new software or significant upgrades to existing software which have not been
implemented yet.

When projects included in AUC (both under intangible assets or property, plant and equipment) are
completed, the capitalised amount is allocated to the respective asset class which can result into a
transfer within the same asset class, from intangible fixed assets to property, plant and equipment or
the opposite way.

Assets under construction mainly represent costs incurred in the construction of the Group’s
network. When projects included in AUC (both under intangible assets or property, plant and
equipment) are completed, the capitalised amount is allocated to the respective asset class which
can result into a transfer within the same asset class, from intangible fixed assets to property,
plant and equipment or the opposite way. The additions primarily relate to investments in
telecommunication equipment for the modernisation of the T-Mobile network.

**12** **Capitalized contract costs**

Following the transition to IFRS 15, the remeasurement effect totaling EUR 45.5 million was
recognized directly in equity as of 1 January 2018 in relation to the initial recognition of capitalized
contract costs. Under IFRS 15, these costs would have resulted in the later recognition of selling
expenses in earlier reporting periods. The carrying amount had changed to EUR 50.6 million as of 31
December 2018. For more information on the new accounting standards, please refer to the
Section 2.2.

The costs of obtaining a contract included in the carrying amount as of the end of 2018 primarily
comprise of sales commissions paid to third-party retailers in the indirect sales channel and to
employees in the direct sales channel.

In the 2018 financial year, capitalized contract costs of EUR 50.6 million were amortized. The increase
of EUR 5.1 million in capitalized contract costs compared with the initial recognition as of 1 January
2018 is attributable to a higher level of capitalized costs of obtaining a contract.

Following the transition to IFRS 15, a remeasurement effect totaling EUR 1.9 million was recognized
directly in equity as of 1 January 2018. This related to the initial recognition of contract liabilities that
would have resulted in the later recognition of revenue under IFRS 15. In addition, a total of EUR
70.2 million was reclassified as contract liabilities as of 1 January 2018 in connection with IFRS 15.
This reclassification comprises deferred revenue that was recognized under trade and other payables.
The carrying amount for current and non-current contract liabilities was remeasured at EUR 5.1 million
as of the end of the 2018 financial year. For more information on the new accounting standards, please
refer to the Section 2.2.

Of the total of remeasured contract liabilities, EUR 3.8 million (1 January 2018: nil) is due within one
year.

Revenue of EUR 0.7 million from the remeasured contract liabilities that were still outstanding at the
start of the 2018 financial year was realized during the reporting year.

In 2007 and 2010, T-Mobile effected a demerger of its entire business (i.e. all assets and liabilities)
including its operating company subsidiaries in exchange for shares emitted to T-Mobile Netherlands
Holding B.V. These transactions resulted in step-ups in the tax basis (temporary differences) in the

fiscal unity T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. The deferred tax asset recognized in the balance sheet
relates for the main part to the above mentioned step ups and is therefore considered to be a
recoverable temporary difference.

T-Mobile Klantenservice B.V., T-Mobile Netherlands Retail B.V., T-Mobile Netherlands Finance
B.V.,T-Mobile Thuis B.V. and T-Mobile Infra B.V. (until 1 September 2018) were part of one fiscal unity.
Under the Dutch Collection of State Taxes Act, the Group and its fellow group members are jointly and
severally liable for any taxes payable by each tax group.

**31** **Share-based payments**

In December 2017, Deutsche Telekom Group introduced a Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme. The
purpose of the Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme is to support further growth and success of business
of the Group by providing an incentive for members of the Management Board and other employees to
perform to the best of their abilities and to remain in the service of the Group. Eligibility to participate in
the Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme is determined at the sole discretion of the Supervisory Board.

The rights entitle the employees to a cash payment at the end date (31 December 2021). The amount
payable will be determined based on the increase of the Group’s equity value between the grant date
and the vesting date (31 December 2021). To determine the vesting value of the rights, certain internal
parameters have been used. The Stock Appreciation Rights must be exercised on vesting date and will
expire if not exercised on that date. The maximum amount payable of the Stock Appreciation Rights
Scheme is EUR 80 million.

Under the Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme a total of 10,000,000 rights are available to grant to
employees. Each right is divided into one Class A right and one Class B right. Both classes are related
to a certain value creation at the vesting date. The Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme includes a
leaver arrangement. Based on certain criteria, an employee shall be entitled to receive a pro rate share
of the amount payable. The fair value of a Stock Appreciation Right pair as at 31 December 2018 was
EUR 6.75, amounting to a total expected pay-out of EUR 44.4 million in 2022. The corresponding
provision as at 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 11.1 million.

**32** **Financial instruments and risk management**

This note covers financial instruments and risk management. For further information on financial
instruments, please refer in particular to Note 5 “Trade and other receivables,” Note 8 “Other assets,”
Note 13 “Interest bearing loans and borrowings,” Note 14 “Trade and other payables,” and Note 16
“Contract liabilties”.

**32.1** **Objectives and policies**

The Group’s principal financial assets comprise of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and due
from related parties. The Group’s principal financial liabilities consist of payables and due to related
parties.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk (including currency risk,
interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

There have been no changes in the objectives, policies and processes for managing and measuring
risk from the previous year.

**32.2** **Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The
objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters.

**32.3** **Foreign currency risk management**

The Group mainly derives its revenues from its operations in the Netherlands and for some part by
generating roaming revenues for mobile traffic outside the Netherlands. Based on a risk analysis, the
Group determined that it is exposed to minimal currency risk as most of the transactions are
denominated in euros. The remaining risk is not material. No positions are hedged.

**32.4** **Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables
from customers. The Group does not have any significant concentration of credit risk. The Group’s
clients primarily consist of consumers and businesses with low average balances which are regularly
reviewed. If and when necessary, these consumers are disconnected from service when no payment is
received. Credit risk is taken into account through a combination of specific and general valuation
allowances. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying
amount of each class of financial assets mentioned above.

As at 31 December 2018, the gross amount of the trade receivables is EUR 350.7 million. Credit loss
allowances of EUR 50.3 million (31 December 2017: EUR 27.4 million) are recognised for
uncollectability.

- Other movements mainly relate to a reclassification of a provision for debt collection agency which
is related to remeasurement of receivables.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped
based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to
unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables
for the same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for
trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 month before
31 December 2018 or 1 January 2018 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses
experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forwardlooking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the
receivables. The Group has identified the GDP and the unemployment rate of the countries in which it
sells its goods and services to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss
rates based on expected changes in these factors.

F-219


-----

On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2018 and 1 January 2018 (on adoption of IFRS
9) was determined as included in the schedule on for both trade receivables and contract assets.

The group exercises considerable judgment in the classification of their in-house cash pool balances
as cash equivalents. These in-house cash pool balances are managed within the Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTAG) group treasury function. The DTAG group treasury function operates as an in-house bank
which has similar characteristics as a regular bank. It maintains sufficient cash and liquid resources,
along with access to credit lines, to meet all inter-company obligations simultaneously. With respect to
DTAG’s liquidity risk, DTAG has met its targets for the liquidity reserve to cover at least the maturities
for the next 24 months in both 2017 and 2018. Deutsche Telekom had standardized bilateral credit
agreements with 22 banks for a total of EUR 12.9 billion as of 31 December 2018. As of 31 December
2018, EUR 0.6 billion of these credit lines had been utilized. The DTAG central treasury department is
responsible for the coordination of all intragroup cash and payment flows. The internal control
processes and procedures from the DTAG central treasury department are implemented and
monitored according to the minimum requirements set by the German Financial Market Authority,
where applicable. The DTAG central treasury department monitors the balances of all companies that
are part of the central cash pooling and ensures sufficient funding of the respective balances.

In addition the company has direct access to these cash pool accounts and is entitled to terminate the
cash pooling agreement without notice for good reason.

Management have therefore assessed that these balances are highly liquid instruments that are also
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s maximum credit risk can be depicted as follows:

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk from fair value at profit or loss at 31 December 2018 and
1 January 2018 is equal to the carrying amounts.

**32.5** **Interest rate risk management**

The Group has a two fixed interest group loan facilities, therefore the Group did not incur interest rate
risk. As per 31 December 2018 the fixed interest rate is 4,25 %.

**32.6** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet financial obligations as they fall due. The
Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group manages its liquidity risks by using Deutsche Telekom AG companies to secure financing.
If necessary, further funding is provided by the Group’s finance companies. In Note 13 the outstanding
loan payable with GTS Central European Holding B.V. has been disclosed.

The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain shareholder, creditors and
market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Group’s objectives when
managing capital are:

    - to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to
provide returns for its shareholder and benefits for other stakeholder, and

    - to provide an adequate return to its shareholder by pricing products and services
commensurately with the level of risk.

**32.9** **Transfer of assets (factoring of receivables)**

T-Mobile is party to factoring agreements under which it sells trade receivables on a revolving basis.
The receivables are sold on a daily basis or quarterly basis and settled on a monthly basis. The

F-223


-----

receivables sold entail both telecom charges already due and charges from sales of handsets payable
over a period of up to two years. The debtors are consumers as well as business customers. In none of
the transactions is T-Mobile exposed to risks other than the credit risk and late-payment risk resulting
from the sold receivables agreed in the respective agreement. The term of the agreements ends
between 2020 and 2021. The factoring transactions involve the splitting of significant risks and rewards
with control remaining at T-Mobile without the involvement of structured entities(I) and the factoring
agreements involve the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining at T-Mobile with
the involvement of structured entities.

(I) Factoring transactions involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining
at T-Mobile without the involvement of structured entities.

A factoring transaction is in place under which banks are required to purchase trade receivables. The
receivables sold entail charges from sales of handsets payable over a period of up to two years. The
factoring agreement has a maximum funding amount of EUR 90 million. The purchase price will be
paid out immediately upon sale. The term of the factoring transaction ended on 30 June 2019. On
5 December 2019 the term of this factoring transaction has been extended to 30 June 2021. The risks
relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the receivables sold are the credit risk and the risk of
late payments (late-payment risk). The purchase price corresponds to the nominal amount. The
maximum credit risk from the various tranches to be borne by T-Mobile amounts to EUR 14.6 million
(2017: EUR 14.4 million).

The other credit risk-related losses are borne by the banks. The late-payment risk continues to be
borne by T-Mobile. T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR
14.6 million (2017: EUR 14.4 million), and the carrying amount of the associated liability was EUR
14.6 million (2017: EUR 14.4 million). The outstanding amount of receivables as per 31 December
2018 for this particular factoring transaction amounted to EUR 78.5 million (2017: EUR 37.2 million). In
2018 T-Mobile expensed EUR 1.1 million, including credit-risk discounts and loss allocations to cover
monthly credit risks, in the financial year from its continuing involvement including program fees
(interest and bank margin), and has expensed a total amount of EUR 4.5 million since the beginning of
the transaction.

(II) Factoring transactions involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining
at T-Mobile with the involvement of structured entities.

The factoring agreements have a maximum program volume of EUR 150 million. If the buyer agrees to
purchase receivables beyond this amount, the purchase price payment shall be deferred until the
maximum program volume decreases again by the corresponding amount. With this structure, there is
no structured entity consolidated by T-Mobile. Rather, the receivables are sold directly to a structured
entity that is not consolidated by T-Mobile due to the lack of ability to direct the entity’s relevant
activities. This structured entity holds the receivables and allocates the risks and rewards resulting
from these to T-Mobile and a bank on the basis of contractual arrangements.

The structured entity is financed through the issue of commercial paper to third parties outside T-Mobile
or, alternatively, through a credit facility provided by a bank. In one receivables portfolio, the receivables
are purchased in an automated process based on the purchase criteria set out in the receivables
purchase agreement. In another receivables portfolio, the structured entity has the freedom to decide
whether and which receivables will be purchased, though purchase of the agreed minimum volume is
imperative. T-Mobile is obligated to buy back aged receivables and receivables for which a write-down
is imminent at nominal value. The cash flows resulting from the buy-backs would occur in the month
following the buy-back. Such buy-backs of receivables would not affect the allocation of the credit riskrelated losses in any way, as the latter would be passed back to the buyers in line with the agreed risk
allocation. The nominal volume of the receivables sold by T-Mobile and not yet settled by the debtors
was EUR 134 million (2017: EUR 115 million) as of the reporting date. None of the structured entities
has business activities other than the purchase or sale of trade receivables or other investments.

The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the sold receivables are based on the credit
risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). The maximum credit risk to be borne by T-Mobile
amounts to EUR 7.4 million (2017: EUR 6.4 million) as of the reporting date when translated into euros

F-224


-----

and is largely attributable to transactions involving structured entities. The other credit risk-related
losses are borne by the buyers. The late-payment risk continues to be borne in full by T-Mobile. The
maximum exposure to loss for T-Mobile resulting from credit risk and late-payment risk relating to the
receivables sold at the reporting date is EUR 7.6 million (2017: EUR 6.6 million) and is largely
attributable to transactions involving structured entities. Substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the receivables were neither transferred nor retained (allocation of the material risks and
rewards between T-Mobile and the buyers).

T-Mobile continues to perform servicing for the receivables sold. Under the factoring agreements in
which structured entities are engaged, buyers have the right to transfer the servicing to third parties for
no specific reason. Although T-Mobile is not authorized to use the receivables sold other than in its
capacity as servicer, it retains control over the receivables sold because the buyers and the structured
entities do not have the practical ability to resell the purchased receivables. At the time the receivables
are sold, the fair value of the expected losses is expensed. Expected future payments are presented
as a component of the associated liability. In transactions with structured entities, certain portions of
the purchase price are initially held back and, depending on the amount of the actual defaults, are only
paid to T-Mobile at a later date. To the extent that such portions of the purchase price are expected to
be received in the future, they are recognized at fair value. T-Mobile continues to recognize the trade
receivables sold to the extent of its continuing involvement, i.e., in the maximum amount with which it is
still liable for the credit risk and late-payment risk inherent in the receivables sold, and recognizes a
corresponding associated liability presented in liabilities to banks.

The receivables and the associated liability are then derecognized in the extent to which T-Mobile’s
continuing involvement is reduced (particularly when payment is made by the customer). The carrying
amount of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the extent to which the actual losses to be borne
by T-Mobile resulting from the credit risk and the late-payment risk exceed the losses initially expected.
This amount is recognized as an expense.

T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 7.4 million (2017: EUR
6.4 million), and the carrying amount of the associated liability was EUR 7.6 million (2017: EUR 6.6
million). T-Mobile presents the purchase price payments received from the buyers under cash
generated from operations where these relate to the derecognized portion of the receivables, and
under net cash from/used in financing activities where they relate to the portion of the receivables that
is still recognized. The volume of receivables sold was not subject to major fluctuations since the
beginning of the respective transaction.

**Financial covenants**

The Company’s factoring agreements are subject to financial covenants. For two factoring agreements
the financial covenant consist of the tangible net worth ratio based on the audited annual consolidated
financial statements. The tangible net worth ratio shall be equal to or greater than 0.18 with the
tangible net worth being equal or greater than EUR 500 million. The tangible net worth ratio is
calculated as follows (A) divided by (B) whereas (A) is tangible net worth and (B) is balance sheet total.
Tangible net worth means share capital plus reserves (including retained earnings) plus minority
interests minus (plus (if a negative figure)) cash flow hedge reserve minus intangible assets (excluding
licenses). The balance sheet total means balance sheet total minus (plus (if a negative figure)) cash
flow hedge reserve) minus intangible assets (excluding licenses). Based on the audited annual
consolidated financial statements the tangible net worth ratio amounted to 0.23 in 2018 (2017: 0.55).
The tangible net worth amounted to EUR 521 million (2017: EUR 1.3 billion). Consequently the
financial covenant for the respective factoring agreements have been met for 2018 and 2017. For
another factoring agreement a different set of financial covenant applies. The financial covenant of this
factoring agreement is based on the Company’s unaudited quarterly financial statements for DT group
reporting purposes. The financial covenant is reported to the respective bank on a quarterly basis.

The financial covenant for this factoring agreement consists of:

    - The intra-group funding is at least EUR 300 million;

    - The equity ratio may not fall below 20%;

    - The leverage factor may not exceed 4.0.

**35.1** **Acquisition of Tele2 Netherlands Holding N.V.**

On 2 January 2019 T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. acquired 100% of the shares of Tele 2
Netherlands Holding N.V. from Tele 2 AB. Tele 2 Netherlands Holding N.V. is a mobile and fixed line

telecommunications provider that operates in the Netherlands. The purpose of the transaction is to
create a new strong player in a market that is developing towards one that is led by combined products
of fixed and mobile. By merging the fixed and mobile networks the combined company will achieve the
scale required to smarter invest and drive competition.

The goodwill that will be recognised reflects the significant synergy potential of the combined entity (i.e.
FTE synergies, non-technology synergies and technology synergies) as well as assembled workforce.

The consideration transferred with an aggregate fair value of EUR 957.6 million consists of cash, net
debt assumed and the transfer of 25% of the shares of the acquirer to the seller. The fair value of the
shares transferred is determined on the basis of a business enterprise valuation, or more specifically
the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method.

### The basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on
Auditing. We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section
‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

### Independence
We are independent of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. in accordance with the ‘Wet
toezicht accountantsorganisaties’ (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the ‘Verordening inzake
de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant
independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the
‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).

## Report on the other information included in the annual report

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report
contains other information that consists of:

- the management board report;

- the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information:

- is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements;

- contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in
our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other
information contains material misstatements.

By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was
substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

The board of management is responsible for the preparation of the other information,
including the management board report and the other information in accordance with Part 9
of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

### Responsibilities of the board of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements
The board of management is responsible for:

- the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for

- such internal control as the board of management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board of management is
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the
financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the board of management should prepare the
financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the board of
management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so. The board of management should disclose events and
circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern in the financial statements.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

### Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to
obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our
objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute
level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may not detect all material misstatements.
Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation
of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.

## Appendix to our auditor’s report on the financial statements 2018 of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V.

In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report, we have further set out in this appendix
our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.

### The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism
throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements
and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:

- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.

- Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

- Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of management.

- Concluding on the appropriateness of the board of management’s use of the goingconcern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report and are made in the context of our
opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group
audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for
components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an
opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic
structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this
basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or
specific balances was considered necessary.

We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
