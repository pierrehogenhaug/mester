Such forwardlooking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding our present and future business strategies and the environment in which we operate. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Offering Memorandum include those described under “Risk Factors.” The following are some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from anticipated results or events: - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and its effect on our customers’ behavior; - the severe disruptions in the Dutch and the global economy caused by the spread of the COVID19 pandemic and the impact on our liquidity and access to capital; - the high level of competition in the markets in which we operate; - changes in the economic or political environment in The Netherlands; - our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and the risks associated with those acquisitions; - the risks associated with operating a capital-intensive business; - our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to fund capital expenditures and service our debt obligations; - our ability to limit customer churn; - our ability to secure spectrum; ----- - our reliance on demand for fixed, mobile and broadband products, as well as bundled and premium offerings; - our ability to maintain existing network infrastructure or install new network infrastructure; - the increasing operating costs and inflation risks in the telecommunications industry; - our dependence on our relationship with certain key partners and providers of hardware and software; - our dependence on providers of premium programming for pay TV service and conditional access systems; - failures in our IT and network infrastructure systems; - the risks of fraud on or unauthorized access to our systems; - the risk that a cyber incident could result in information theft or financial loss; - the risk of robberies of our retail stores; - our ability to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards; - failure to protect our image or reputation; - the risk of harm from and liability for cybersecurity failures; - our ability to comply with applicable data protection laws and policies; - failure to provide access to mobile phone financing; - the risk of potential liability for the content hosted on our infrastructure; - the risks of natural disasters, fire, power outages and other catastrophic events; - our ability to attract and retain key personnel; - our ability to maintain our distribution and customer care channels; - the possible health risks of antenna sites and the use of mobile telephones; - the extent to which our business operations are protected by intellectual property rights and our compliance with third-party intellectual property rights; - the risk of operating as a stand-alone business; - the impact of legal proceedings on our business; - the level of governmental regulation and supervision applicable to our business; - the impact of changes to tax legislation on our business; - risks relating to our separation from Deutsche Telekom; - risks relating to the Acquisition; and ----- - other factors related to our indebtedness and financial information, the Notes, our structure, the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral and the Shared Collateral described in more detail under “Risk _Factors.”_ The telecommunications industry is changing rapidly and, therefore, the forward-looking statements of expectations, plans and intent in this Offering Memorandum are subject to a significant degree of risk. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts’ expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Offering Memorandum. We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations in this Offering Memorandum.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer and, following the completion of the Acquisition, the Target will be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

(the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, including the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting (the “Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Historical Consolidated Financial Statements”). The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering Memorandum is derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Financial Statements”). The audited consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were originally approved by us on December 31, 2019. Thereafter, we have restated certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in the 2019 Financial Statements, by restating the classification of “other receivables” to “trade receivables” for an amount of €619 thousand, “other payables” to “current other liabilities” for an amount of €68,947 thousand, “non-current other liabilities” to “other liabilities” for an amount of €2,004 thousand, “other receivables” to “other assets” for an amount of €32,629 thousand and “tax liabilities” to “liabilities held for sale” for an amount of €1,792 thousand. These restatements do not have any impact on the reported profit for the year 2018 or reported equity and an immaterial impact on the cash flow statement for 2018. As a result, we have not separately restated the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. See note 2.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements. ----- In addition, we also present certain financial information of the Target Group for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 (the “LTM Financial Information”). Except as otherwise stated, the LTM Financial Information is derived by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the audited consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income of the Target Group for the year ended December 31, 2020 and deducting the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The LTM Financial Information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. Except as stated otherwise, the LTM Financial Information is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting or in accordance with IFRS. We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) effective from January 1, 2019. As a result, leases (as lessee) that would have been classified in previous periods as operating leases are recognized in our consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019. Under the new standard, except for short-term or low-value leases, the right to use a leased asset is recognized as an asset with a corresponding financial liability for the present value of outstanding lease payments. Assets with a finite useful life are subject to impairment testing. We have adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective method. On the transition to IFRS 16, remaining payment obligations from existing operating leases were discounted using the relevant incremental borrowing rate and recognized as a lease liability and the right-to-use assets were carried as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments. As a result of the application of new accounting standards and the associated impact on our Historical Consolidated Financial Statements, prospective investors should exercise particular caution when comparing our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 to our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The preparation of our financial statements involves judgments, estimates and assumptions, and changes in financial accounting standards may cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.” For a discussion of the_ effects of the adoption of IFRS 16 on our financial condition and results of operations, see “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Adoption of IFRS 16” and note 2.4 to the 2019 Financial Statements._ We have included in this Offering Memorandum for the convenience of the reader, certain metrics excluding the impact of cash leases that have been impacted by IFRS 16 as the adoption of IFRS 16 has had a significant impact on our historical financials which has impacted the comparability of some of our Historical Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum and we believe it is of interest to investors to present certain measures excluding such impact to facilitate like-for-like comparability between our historical financial information during the periods under review. After the completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group will not prepare separate consolidated financial statements and we instead intend to report our consolidated financial results at the level of the Parent. Due to this, our future financial statements may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. Our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"Operating under the T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel brands, we are one of the three mobile network operators (“MNOs”) in the Dutch telecommunications market. We offer mobile (both postpaid and prepaid) and fixed telecommunications services to both B2C and B2B customers, and we also sell handsets to our customers. We are the largest mobile telecommunications provider in the Dutch consumer market by mobile service revenue and number of SIMs, we have been ranked as the best mobile network in The Netherlands for the fifth year in a row, and we have also been ranked as the top network in the world (Source: Umlaut, The _2021 Mobile Network Test in The Netherlands; PresseBox, T-Mobile Awarded “Best in Test” Worldwide by Umlaut)._ As of September 30, 2021, we had 6.9 million mobile subscribers and 0.7 million fixed subscribers, representing an increase of approximately 29% and 24%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2018. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions and other adjustments, our combined mobile service revenues totaled €1,215.1 million, our combined fixed line services revenue totaled €391 million, and our revenue from the sale of goods and services, and other revenues totaled €443 million. Mobile service revenue combines mobile revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as visitor roaming, and our fixed line services revenue combines fixed line revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as fixed line wholesale revenue. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions and other adjustments, our revenue for the B2C segment totaled €1,239 million and for the B2B segment was €292 million. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was €637.4 million. TMNL traces its origins back to 2002, when Deutsche Telekom entered the Dutch market through the acquisition of Ben, which it subsequently rebranded as T-Mobile in 2003. In 2007, we acquired Orange Netherlands, making us the third largest mobile operator in The Netherlands after Koninklijke KPN N.V. (“KPN”) and VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V. (“VFZ”). In 2016, we acquired Vodafone’s fixed business, Vodafone Thuis, which was subsequently renamed to TMNL Thuis. This transaction marked our entry into the fixed market, adding approximately 150,000 fixed line customers. Through the TMNL Thuis acquisition, we also gained access to a dark fiber footprint on KPN’s fiber network (KPN ODF). In January 2019, we completed the acquisition of Tele2, strengthening our position in the Dutch market, across all segments. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, an online-only SIM-only MVNO on our network, focusing in particular on the low budget segment of the market. The Simpel acquisition further strengthened our position, making us the leader both in terms of B2C mobile postpaid SIM cards and service revenues. We continue to operate the Simpel brand after its acquisition in 2020. In April 2021, we announced a strategic partnership with Open Dutch Fiber, a company owned by KKR and DTCP that plans to roll-out fiber services to over one million homes passed. We are the anchor tenant on this network which focuses on dense, urban areas in which we currently have a large mobile market share. The Open Dutch Fiber partnership is an example of our asset-light model and lean operational setup, which we believe enables us to streamline our business and optimize our indirect cost base ratio. We provide our B2C customers with a multi-brand portfolio of mobile services, including voice, messaging and broadband aiming to cover all segments of the market from premium to low-budget and operating on our own networks of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G spectra. Through T-Mobile Thuis, we offer nationwide fixed broadband, TV and fixed voice services with FTTH and xDSL (copper) technologies. In addition, and in line with market trends, we offer B2C customers packages that bundle mobile and fixed telecommunications services at attractive prices, known as FMC packages. Our B2B business segment is dedicated to meeting the ----- connectivity needs of companies of all types and sizes as we offer a broad range of telecommunications solutions, cloud-based and unified communications solutions. The chart below sets forth key events in our growth and transformation to the largest mobile telecommunications provider in The Netherlands’ B2C market and an established mobile-led FMC challenger. We have invested heavily in our offerings and we believe we have successfully repositioned our business through innovation and change, as evidenced by our new offerings and services and by our being the first provider to offer nationwide 5G coverage on the 700 MHz band. Going forward, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on further growth opportunities, enabling us to continue on our historical trajectory and set new industry standards. The chart below highlights some of our key successes between 2015 and 2020. _Source: Telecompaper, competitor reports, Company information.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,Attractive telecommunications market structure in The Netherlands,"We operate in The Netherlands, which has a sizeable and attractive telecommunications market which consists of three main telecommunications providers. The Netherlands is the 6[th ]largest economy in Europe and has a robust macroeconomic environment, with 2% real GDP growth expected for 2021, moderate population and household growth, and a large demand for high-quality communication services (Source: Telecompaper). We compete in both the mobile and the fixed markets with KPN and VFZ. We are the premier company in the B2C mobile market with a 42% market share as calculated by our number of postpaid SIM subscribers, as ----- compared to a 30% market share for KPN and 25% for VFZ in the same market. The MVNO market is small accounting for approximately 4% market share of postpaid SIMs, with the largest MVNO, Youfone, having an approximately 3% market share based on number of SIM subscribers. In this context, we believe the risk of irrational behaviors by existing competitors is low and that existing MNOs are likely to compete primarily on the quality of their services. Following our acquisition of Tele2, the market players were further consolidated from four to three and a process of revenue and ARPU stabilization started, similar to what has been seen in other markets such as Austria, Germany or Ireland. The Netherlands has one of the lowest ARPU levels in Europe. We also believe that the risk of a new MNO entering the market is low. We believe that this is due to the following factors: (i) the highly converged nature of the market, making it less attractive for new entrants, as they must be able to offer both mobile and fixed offers to be competitive therein and (ii) the lack of any viable spectrum auction that could allow the entrance of a new player, since the upcoming 5G spectrum auction in The Netherlands is planned to offer only a specific band of spectrum and we do not need to renew our existing spectrum licenses until 2030, making the auction more suitable for existing MNOs and unsuitable for new entrants. The most recent possibility for a new entrant to obtain a marketable spectrum allocation would have been the 2020 multi-band spectrum auction. However, only the three main players in the telecommunications market, namely KPN, VFZ and us, participated in the auction. Additionally, we believe that the competitive risk posed by MVNOs is low because MVNOs have limited ability to compete on unlimited subscriptions in light of each MVNO’s lack of owned network and their limited ability to cover FMC packages, as well as such unlimited plans’ impact on costs. Indeed, the number of MVNOs has decreased by half from approximately 60 to approximately 30 in The Netherlands over the last six years. Furthermore, we anticipate that the B2C mobile market will continue to grow as data traffic continues to increase. Indeed, our B2C mobile pro forma service revenues grew by 3.1% in 2020 (after a 4.1% decrease in 2019) despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Key trends include: (i) Growth in postpaid SIMs subscriptions, which is driven both by prepaid to postpaid subscription migration and by population growth, as well as trends of increasing proportions of multi-SIM subscriptions; and (ii) Growth in mobile ARPU as driven by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services, value-added services as well as overall inflation and the telecommunications market’s shift towards larger data bundles. We believe that B2C ARPU will grow in the future due to these factors, even though mobile ARPUs had decreased in The Netherlands in past years because of intense price competition and mobile discounting as part of FMC offers, mainly triggered by KPN and VFZ. The following table sets out historical trends in B2C mobile services ARPU across our brands and our two major competitors, KPN and VFZ, and demonstrates that while ARPU among our competitors has generally decreased in recent years, ARPU among our brands has generally increased or stabilized. ----- _Source: Company information and publicly available information adjusted based on management estimates._ The B2B market has seen similar developments. In particular, ARPU in the SOHO/VSE segment follows consumer market trends, driven as in the B2C market by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services and value-added services, and we believe those drivers will continue to push ARPU growth. In the B2B market generally, we believe that growth in subscribers will be driven by growth in SOHO/VSE businesses, an increased adoption of mobile services in the B2B market and an increasing adoption of converged telecommunications solutions. Additionally, the Dutch fixed telecommunications market has benefitted from infrastructure upgrades in recent years that have contributed to a growing market, in spite of declining telephony and peaking TV, primarily due to a higher demand for broadband services at higher speeds, which is our core product offering within the fixed segment. Historically, the fixed internet market in The Netherlands was dominated by KPN and VFZ, which have a combined market share of approximately 80%. We have positioned ourselves as a challenger in this market, focusing on providing fast broadband services and offering competitive and sustainable pricing. In the future, we believe that growth in the fixed market will be driven by (i) an increase in subscribers associated with household growth and (ii) premium customers’ willingness to pay for ultrafast fiber and better quality, which allows for more-for-more strategies and results in increasing demand for higher fiberbased data bundles. FTTH coverage is expanding in The Netherlands and the B2C and B2B markets are expected to benefit from such expansion. We expect to benefit from this trend through what we call our ‘Magenta’ footprint, which includes several Optical Distribution Framework-type of agreements and partnerships with, among others, Open Dutch Fiber, KPN’s affiliate Reggefiber Operator B.V. and Primevest Capital Partners, where we expect to ----- eventually have access to over three million households at sustainable commercial terms. The remaining households can be reached by Wholesale Broadband Access (“WBA”)-type of access on KPN copper (until its planned phase-out over the next three years) and/or fiber network. Additional infrastructure players of significant size include Delta Fiber, Glaspoort (a joint venture between KPN and APG Groep N.V.) and Eurofiber.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,World-class network and strong commercial execution,"We lead our competitors across a number of key attributes, including our world-class mobile network with the largest spectrum portfolio in The Netherlands, our leading brand portfolio and our strong commercial execution. In December 2020, Umlaut ranked us the best mobile network in The Netherlands for the fifth year in a row, and in February 2021, they recognized us as the top network in the world (Sources: PresseBox, Five in _a Row—T-Mobile Wins the Umlaut Connect Mobile Benchmark in The Netherlands Again; PresseBox, T- Mobile Awarded “Best in Test” Worldwide by Umlaut). According to the ACM, our mobile network carries_ approximately 50% of mobile data traffic in The Netherlands. We believe that our leading network position results from our efficiently leveraging three key pillars: (i) technology, such as single radio access network (“RAN”) with future-proof site configurations that are regularly upgraded in anticipation of customer demand; (ii) sites, as we operate an optimal site grid with the highest site density in urban areas and 4,982 base stations in total, providing coverage to more than 99% of the population of The Netherlands; (iii) the largest mobile spectrum portfolio in The Netherlands with interference-free low bands, resulting in high cost efficiency and an indoor capacity advantage. As of December 31, 2020, we held an aggregate of 250 MHz of spectrum, in comparison with 215 MHz for VFZ and 195 MHz for KPN. None of the licenses in our portfolio need to be renewed before 2030. We have distinguished ourselves by our distinctive brand portfolio. In line with other MNOs in The Netherlands, we have been following value-based and more-for-more strategies that target different market segments with separate brands. Each of our four brands has a distinctive positioning with differentiated profiles, as summarized in the following chart.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Simpel,9.5.1,"Well-positioned to benefit from market tailwinds for growth in market share, B2C revenue, customer satisfaction and ARPU","Our status as a leading B2C mobile operator is confirmed by our market share as measured by our volume of subscribers and by our revenue. As of December 31, 2020, we have 42% of the B2C mobile postpaid market share by volume, which corresponds to 5.1 million SIMs. We have managed to reach our leading volume market share of 42% over the past three years, supported in part by the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, while the absolute number of subscribers grew at a CAGR of 4.5% between 2018 and 2020. At the same time, our market share by revenue increased from 33% to 40% over the same period. Our B2C mobile revenue growth in the past three years was mainly driven by stable ARPUs at brand levels and a growing subscriber base, driven by marketing strategies for our brands, our strong positioning in unlimited bundles on T-Mobile and Tele2, and an increase in demand for cheaper bundles with Ben and Simpel. We have also maintained growth in customer satisfaction, which has helped us retain customers. In the B2C mobile market, TMNL outpaced its competitors in The Netherlands by delivering the fastest-increasing customer satisfaction TRI*M score over the last decade. TRI*M is a customer satisfaction metric widely adopted within the Deutsche Telekom Group which combines customer recommendation, customer likelihood to continue services, competitive advantage and performance. Our TRI*M score increased by over 50% over 12 years. We believe that an increase in customer satisfaction was one of the key factors driving the reduction in our B2C mobile churn to approximately 11% in 2020. We believe that our position as a leading B2C mobile operator with growing customer satisfaction metrics situates us well to take advantage of trends towards converged fixed and mobile offerings and more ----- for-more strategies, as it allows us a larger base of customers to cross-sell into FMC packages and to upsell into more premium offers. See “—World-class network and strong commercial execution” and “Industry—Dutch _Broadband and Fixed Telephony Market—Focus on fixed broadband market.” Already in the first three quarters_ of 2021, our ARPU has grown across all four of our brands, corresponding to increases of between €0.8 and €1.1 in the third quarter of 2021 in comparison with the first quarter of 2021. We expect to experience moderate growth in the future by building on our success in growing subscriber base and potential further ARPU growth.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Simpel,9.5.2,High operational efficiency and an asset-light fixed model,"We have a successful track record of M&A, synergy realization and cost optimization. This track record, combined with a lean, asset-light fixed business model has given us operating leverage and operational efficiency. In 2016, we acquired Vodafone’s B2C fixed business, Vodafone Thuis, which we shortly thereafter rebranded T-Mobile Thuis. Vodafone’s divestiture of Vodafone Thuis was ordered by the European Commission as a remedy to provide competition clearance for VFZ, the joint venture between Vodafone and Ziggo. This acquisition marked the beginning of our present fixed internet business and added about 150,000 fixed-line customers. In January 2019, we completed our acquisition of Tele2. This acquisition has strengthened our position in the Dutch telecommunications market and allowed us to compete more effectively with KPN and VFZ by giving us enhanced scale, combined spectrum resources and significant synergy potential. We are executing a three-year plan to realize synergies from our acquisition of Tele2 in 2019. We have closed Tele2’s standalone stores and we are in the process of implementing significant operations costs savings. Based on our estimates, we anticipate realizing Tele2 cost-saving synergies with a total run-rate synergy potential of €130 million by 2024, of which we have already realized €115 million of synergies run-rate as of September 30, 2021. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, by then the largest MVNO in The Netherlands. By means of this transaction, we acquired one million additional B2C mobile postpaid customers who were already using our network under Simpel’s prior wholesale agreement with us. The acquisition of Simpel provide further synergy and cost savings potential to be realized in the total amount of approximately €9 million by 2024. Synergies related to Tele2 and Simpel entail for example related to reduced interconnect costs, migration of Tele2’s business support system (“BSS”) to our Magenta stack, synergies in respect of bad debt collections (representing improved client acceptance and collection practices implemented upon integration with TMNL), direct and indirect cost savings related to the discontinuance of the Tele2 network and the cancellation of leased telecommunications towers, reduction in marketing expenses as a result of mobile cross-selling, optimization of campaigning periods, reduction in other indirect costs such as personnel related costs as well as legal audit and tax fees. For risks related to our growth through acquisitions, see “Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, including the risk that we may not be able to integrate newly acquired operations into our business, which may prevent us from realizing the strategic and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and thus adversely affect our business.”_ We believe that these strategic acquisitions, coupled with our rapid and successful organic growth initiatives, position us well to capture further market share and grow margins across the business segments in which we operate. Further, our lean and digital business model also allows us to benefit from strong operating leverage. Aside from the lean operating cost base described above, we have also repositioned ourselves to become a digital telecommunications company with an asset-light fixed model. On September 1, 2018, we demerged our tower business into Cignal Infrastructure (at demerger and until June 2021, T-Infra). Subsequently, on January 1, 2019, one day prior to the closing of the Tele2 acquisition, we distributed Cignal Infrastructure as a dividend in kind to Deutsche Telekom, with TMNL continuing to have full access to the contributed infrastructure through a long-term, arms-length service agreement. In June 2021, Deutsche Telekom sold Cignal Infrastructure to Digital Infrastructure Vehicle 1 SCSP, which is a joint venture of Cellnex and DTCP. Currently, we benefit from access to 3,150 towers owned by Cignal Infrastructure with nationwide coverage under a long term contract for an initial term of 15 years, with the option for T-Mobile Netherlands to renew for two additional periods of 10 years each, and at favorable terms consisting of a capped yearly cost increase in line with the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, we continue to hold our own market-leading mobile spectrum portfolio. ----- In our fixed segment we also have an asset-light model. Our partners, Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest, are conducting the roll-out of our FTTH network, and we do not have any direct fixed access network ownership. We expect to have access to the over one million FTTH homes that Open Dutch Fiber is scheduled to roll out to by 2025 in densely-populated areas with strong TMNL mobile customer presence. Under the Primvest partnership, we expect that we will have FTTH access to approximately 130,000 homes passed. By the terms of this partnership, we benefit from an initial period of exclusivity and line prices with base rates of not more than €15 per month, indexed to inflation and subject to certain adjustments. In both of these partnerships, we have agreed to certain utilization commitments. In addition, we have access to approximately two million homes passed on KPN’s Open Distribution Framework footprint which is completed by WBA for a nationwide fixed network footprint. Such a lean business model has allowed us to achieve total capital expenditure savings of over €700 million, estimated as savings as a result of us not having to allocate and devote capital expenditure on building a fiber network and mobile towers for five years.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Simpel,9.5.3,Strong cash flow profile with demonstrated resilience and strong cash generation,"We have historically demonstrated a track record of growth, profitability improvement and strong cash flow generation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to maintain growth and increase profitability, as evidenced by a 29.7% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin in 2020 in comparison to 26.7% in 2019. We believe this demonstrates the resilience of our business and of our company overall. In addition, we generated a 56% Cash Conversion in 2020 in comparison with an average level of 30% for other international telecommunication companies. We delivered revenue growth in a challenging market environment between 2018 and 2020 at a 2% CAGR. Such growth was mainly driven by a growing subscriber base and stabilizing ARPU levels in the mobile B2C segment, as well as by strong growth in our B2C fixed business. Historically, our B2C mobile segment has been the major contributor to revenue at a 4% CAGR between 2018 and 2020, having accounted for 47% of total revenue in 2020. Our B2C mobile business delivered significant SIM net adds, particularly in the Simpel and Ben brands, and relatively stable ARPUs among those of our brands that offered the increasingly-popular unlimited data bundles. Positive developments offset a decrease in roaming revenue as a result of COVID-19– induced travelling restrictions. Our B2C fixed segment was our fastest-growing segment, growing at a CAGR of 11% over the past three years. We believe that this strong growth was driven by a successful FMC challenger strategy which resulted in strong growth in subscriber base that amounted to an additional 133,000 customers in the past three years. We also delivered strong performance in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, both in terms of margin expansion and growth. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin increased from 22.8% in 2018 to 29.7% in 2020 and to 31.1% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL exhibited a strong CAGR of 16.1% between 2018 and 2020 due to an improved gross margin, declining indirect costs in absolute terms from cost saving programs and headcount reduction, and realization of Tele2 synergies. Because we delivered strong revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL expansion through challenging market conditions, we believe that we are in a position of strength and greater scale to deliver incremental top line and profitability expansion as market conditions improve. We also benefit from a strong cash generation profile driven by a solid top-line performance that is combined with prudent cost management and moderate capital expenditure needs. Our Underlying Operating Free Cash Flow increased by 53% in 2020 compared to 2019, and is expected to continue on a growth trajectory going forward as we maintain our capital expenditure-light strategy. Our Cash Conversion was 56% in 2020 and it further increased to 58.9% during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, which is above the average level of 30% for other international telecommunication companies. The below chart shows our resilience and strong cash flow profile by presenting certain business metrics for the periods under review, on a pro forma basis for the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, the demerger of T-Infra and the application of IFRS 16, as applicable, in each case from January 1, 2018.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategy,9.6.1,"Leverage our leading position in B2C mobile and benefit from market tailwinds on 5G monetization, unlimited offerings, portfolio optimization and increased value-added services","We are a leading B2C mobile operator with a SIM market share of 42% in the B2C mobile postpaid market, corresponding to 5.1 million SIMs as of December 31, 2020. B2C revenue growth resulted from stabilizing ARPUs in 2019 and 2020 as well as a growing subscriber base, further supported by growth in ----- unlimited bundles on T-Mobile and Tele2 as well as an increasing demand for cheaper bundles with Ben and Simpel. We have also seen continued growth in our customer satisfaction. For B2C mobile, we have delivered the fastest increasing customer satisfaction TRI*M score over the last decade, having outpaced our competitors in The Netherlands. Our leading market position provides a strong platform for growth both in terms of volume and value across all brands and segments. In particular, we plan to grow ARPU through (i) 5G monetization, (ii) unlimited growth, (iii) portfolio optimizations, (iv) value-added services and (v) FMC growth. _Drive 5G monetization_ We were the first operator to reach nationwide 5G coverage on the 700 MHz band in 2020, and we believe that we are well positioned to monetize our 5G investments. We offer 5G connectivity per default to our premium offerings, such as T-Mobile’s ‘Unlimited plan,’ or as an add-on to our value offerings, such as a €2 p.c.m. add-on for our Tele2 customers. In the future, we plan to extend our 5G offering and continue our more-for-more portfolio approach on the back of 5G. _Grow unlimited offerings_ We believe that we hold a leading position in unlimited offerings based on our number of subscribers and on our having been the first to have introduced an unlimited plan for mobile in The Netherlands. Our premium offers in the mobile segment are unlimited plans, which we sell for €35 p.c.m. and €25 p.c.m., including value added tax (“VAT”), through the T-Mobile and Tele2 brands respectively. T-Mobile’s ‘Unlimited plan’ also includes 5G connectivity by default. Having introduced these offerings in 2017, our unlimited subscriber base grew from 578,000 subscribers in December 2018 to more than a million subscribers in June 2021. In May 2021, we also introduced an ‘Unlimited & Entertainment’ plan including access to Netflix and Videoland, a Dutch streaming service. We intend to continue to grow our unlimited offerings in the future as we believe that unlimited plans are a key value driver in our premium portfolio by increasing customer loyalty and customer satisfaction, and ultimately result in above-average monthly recurring charges (“MRC”). _Portfolio optimizations_ Our multi-brand portfolio is a key value driver that allows us to effectively compete in all market segments. All our brands have a distinctive positioning, minimizing the risk of intra-brand competition. With approximately 100,000 intra-brand migrations in 2020, creating an average incremental MRC of €1, we have proven the ability to upsell to customers within our portfolio, accruing value. _Value-added services_ We believe that by offering value-added services (“VAS”), we distinguish ourselves from our competitors while increasing ARPU, customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. Our new ‘Unlimited & Entertainment’ package, described above, is one such example. In addition, T-Mobile offers security options and add-ons from the music streaming service Deezer. On Tele2, we recently introduced ‘Unlimited for a day’ and ‘Unlimited weekend’ plans which add VAS to a Tele2 portfolio that already includes, among other things, a 5G priced add-on. _FMC growth_ Compared to KPN and VFZ, who have mobile FMC penetrations of 65% and 71% as of December 31, 2020, we believe that our FMC penetration of 8% as of December 31, 2020 provides us with ample opportunity for growth. While KPN and VFZ leverage their large fixed bases, we intend to focus on crossselling our fixed offerings into our leading consumer mobile base. Since FMC customers are more loyal, more satisfied and have higher monthly bill sizes compared to one-product customers, we expect FMC growth to be attractive, both, in terms of volume and value. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategy,9.6.2,Capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus,"We are a successful challenger in the B2C fixed market with approximately 9% market share by subscribers in 2020. In the past three years, as our business has grown its subscriber base and revenue at a CAGR of approximately 11%, marking the fastest growth among our competitors, our market share has grown from 7% in 2018 to 9% in 2020 and our share of total subscriber gross adds has grown from 17% in 2018 to 20% in 2020. We believe that we have been able to deliver this rapid, market-leading growth by leveraging our challenger strategy and B2C fixed ARPUs below those of our competition, as our fixed ARPU was approximately €33 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the market average of approximately €50. Our price leadership is evidenced by our FMC offer which combines 1 Gbit internet speeds and a T-Mobile Unlimited subscription for a price of €50 p.m. (€25 p.m. internet + €25 p.m. mobile subscription), compared to €90 p.m. at KPN (€65 p.m. internet + €25 p.m. mobile) and €93 p.m. at VFZ (€65.5 p.m. internet + €27.5 p.m. mobile). These consumer bundle prices are excluding promotions. We believe this lower fixed-segment ARPU and challenger strategy represents a strong lever to continue attracting valueseeking customers. As illustrated in the chart below, we are able to offer fixed and mobile services at a significantly lower price than our competitors. We have an FTTH footprint that covers approximately 1.6 million homes passed on KPN’s and Primevest’s networks. FTTH is also achieved through the Magenta footprint. We expect a further increase of approximately 500,000 homes passed by the end of 2021 and the Magenta footprint is expected to significantly increase homes passed by 2025. Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest partnerships are also key pillars of this strategy. We have secured exclusive agreements with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest in addition to benefitting from non-exclusive ODF wholesale access to the KPN network, complemented by nationwide wholesale access via KPN bitstream. For more about our partnerships with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest, see “—Our _Competitive Strengths—High operational efficiency and an asset-light fixed model.” We believe that our_ partnerships with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest in particular will allow us to grow our fixed subscriber base and drive margin expansion while maintaining healthy cash profile through our capital expenditure-light strategy. In the future, we plan to increase our revenue share through share gains at competitive ARPUs. First, we plan to tap our mobile subscriber base, which is the largest in The Netherlands, to cross-sell our fixed offerings to our mobile customers. In our T-Mobile brand, FMC penetration rose from 4% in 2018 to 20% in 2020, whereas overall for our company, FMC penetration increased from 2% in 2018 to 8% in 2020. However, our FMC penetration remains well below the FMC penetration of our competitors. We believe our penetration will grow in the future both as a result of a focused sales approach and because we expect more SIMs to become FMC-eligible in 2021-2022. Planned quality improvements will also help grow and maintain our fixed base through increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Second, we will rely on highly-competitive ARPU levels to further drive market share gains. Going forward, we are considering shifting towards a value-based proposition by focusing on high-end fiber speeds and value-added services. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategy,9.6.3,Exploit untapped B2B value pools and expand in fixed,"We have established a presence in the B2B market across all segments, namely SOHO/VSE, SMB and LE/CE, both with our mobile and our fixed offerings which represent 71% and 29%, respectively, of our B2B revenue in 2020. Our presence extends across all B2B customer segments with our largest exposure in the SOHO/VSE and LE/CE segments at 36% of B2B mobile service revenues each, followed by the SMB segment with a 25% revenue share (Source: Company information). We have increased our revenue market share in the mobile B2B market from 17% in 2018 to 20% in 2020. For the past three years, we have the fastest-growing B2B mobile operator as measured by SIM net adds, having earned a 43% SIM net adds share in 2020 in comparison with 31% for the closest competitor. We believe this strategy highlights our success in attracting B2B mobile customers and managing churn well, and we believe it will fuel our growth in the coming years. In the fixed B2B market, we had a modest revenue market share of 4% in 2020, affording us an opportunity to grow our presence in the segment in 2021 and beyond. Among our key priorities, we aim to transform the former Tele2 large enterprise legacy business and expand into SOHO/VSE with fixed offerings. Recognizing the above growth path in B2B mobile and the opportunity in B2B fixed, we have defined a strategy to develop our potential in each of our SOHO/VSE, SMB and LE/CE B2B segments. Our entrepreneurial approach is built on four key growth drivers, namely (i) FMC offerings in the SOHO/VSE segment, (ii) an SMB portfolio that combines FMC offerings (a “converged” portfolio) with cloud-based service enhancements, (iii) a differentiating partner approach and (iv) fixed transformation in the LE/CE segment. _FMC offerings in the attractive SOHO/VSE segment_ The SOHO/VSE segment is a highly attractive market for our services, both because of its higher margins and because we believe we are well-positioned to succeed in this space as a result of its similarities with the B2C segment where we are a leader in mobile. This segment has rarely been tapped by either T-Mobile or Tele2 before and it is growing in line with the B2C market. See “—Our Competitive Strengths—Attractive _telecommunications market structure in The Netherlands.” Given our strength in mobile offerings in particular,_ we intend to target the SOHO/VSE segment by relying on FMC offerings. For example, in September 2021, we launched a VSE internet offering and related FMC bundling proposition in order to provide the best value for money, thus opening an additional market segment for us and a potential source of incremental revenue. _FMC and cloud-enhanced SMB portfolio along with differentiating partnering approach_ We operate in the SMB segment under the T-Mobile and selectively under the Tele2 brand for larger SMB customers. Our SMB offering comprises a product portfolio focused on FMC and cloud-enhanced solutions. In the SOHO/VSE segment, we strive for an increase of our Unlimited attach rate as a key value driver. In addition, we believe that our SMB FMC seats will increase, driven by, among other things, a Microsoft Teams integration that forms a unified communications solution which we were the first to launch in the Dutch market. We have a large mobile customer base and, as in the consumer market, we intend to upsell fixed and unified communications services to our mobile base. In addition to our core connectivity services, we sell a broad range of communications and cloud-based solutions tailored to the customers’ needs through our extensive partner portfolio. See also “—Capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus” above. _Fixed transformation in LE/CE_ In the LE/CE segment, we are conducting a transformation of our fixed services in order to realize the full potential of our extended portfolio. We are in the process of a transition from Tele2 legacy fixed infrastructure to future-proof transactional stacks in order to accommodate changing customer demands that request faster and more reliable connections and thus are switching to future-proof fiber-based technologies which includes a shift from copper to fiber, from VPN to SDWAN and a phase-out of ISDN. We also intend to supplement our stable fixed wholesale business with international carriers and Internet Service Providers by wholeselling active services in ODF areas. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

We further streamlined our business with a “3F – Fit For Future” initiative in 2018-2019, having achieved our further cost savings target of €100 million during the two year period 2018-2019. The focus in the coming years will be on optimization of our indirect cost base (“IDC”) ratio through: - _Focusing on smart growth by transforming remaining legacy architecture, digitizing processes towards self-service, improving fixed product quality and transforming the OSS while focusing on high-margin segments, thereby increasing our scale; - _Countering inflation with efficiencies by investing in marketing automation, robotic process automation and first-time right focus to deliver efficiency gains as they increase productivity; and - _Continuing to optimize costs by investing in systems and process improvements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

We intend to build on our past ESG successes with a four-pillar ESG program. Our first pillar is sustainability. In 2020, we already used 100% green electricity and produced 60,000 kWh of renewable energy by using our own solar panels. In 2021, we introduced eco-plastic, E-SIMs and lighter packaging. Additionally, we have targeted a reduction to carbon neutral emission level by 2026. Furthermore, we will reduce new plastic packaging to zero by 2026. We continue to be involved in our community in other ways, such as our establishment of two partnerships to accelerate “Innovation for Society” projects in 2020. For 2021 and 2022, we aim to set up three impactful “Innovation for Society” partnerships to invest in e-health, education and smart cities. Going forward, we intend to continue setting up three partnerships a year. We also focus on digital inclusion, as our goal is to enable more people to be part of the digital society. In 2020, more than 2,500 people gained access to the digital society with our social SIM program and we reached more than 15,000 people through our debt prevention program. Our target is to reach more than 25,000 disadvantaged individuals every year. Lastly, our management aims to foster an environment in which everyone feels included. We have set up a dedicated work stream in the diversity and inclusion program focused on activities and awareness within the company, sharpened our policy on social return and set up a “Back to work” fund. For 2021 and 2022, our focus is on diversity and inclusion, such as through setting up gender-neutral communication and starting the dialogue on safety and belonging.

The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering Memorandum is derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Financial Statements”). The audited consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were originally approved by us on December 31, 2019. Thereafter, we have restated certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in the 2019 Financial Statements, by restating the classification of “other receivables” to “trade receivables” for an amount of €619 thousand, “other payables” to “current other liabilities” for an amount of €68,947 thousand, “non-current other liabilities” to “other liabilities” for an amount of €2,004 thousand, “other receivables” to “other assets” for an amount of €32,629 thousand and “tax liabilities” to “liabilities held for sale” for an amount of €1,792 thousand. These restatements do not have any impact on the reported profit for the year 2018 or reported equity and an immaterial impact on the cash flow statement for 2018. As a result, we ----- have not separately restated the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. See note 2.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements. In addition, we also present certain financial information of the Target Group for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 (the “LTM Financial Information”). Except as otherwise stated, the LTM Financial Information is derived by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the audited consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income of the Target Group for the year ended December 31, 2020 and deducting the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The LTM Financial Information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. Except as stated otherwise, the LTM Financial Information is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting or in accordance with IFRS. We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) effective from January 1, 2019. As a result, leases (as lessee) that would have been classified in previous periods as operating leases are recognized in our consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019. Under the new standard, except for short-term or low-value leases, the right to use a leased asset is recognized as an asset with a corresponding financial liability for the present value of outstanding lease payments. Assets with a finite useful life are subject to impairment testing. We have adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective method. On the transition to IFRS 16, remaining payment obligations from existing operating leases were discounted using the relevant incremental borrowing rate and recognized as a lease liability and the right-to-use assets were carried as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments. As a result of the application of new accounting standards and the associated impact on our Historical Consolidated Financial Statements, prospective investors should exercise particular caution when comparing our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 to our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The preparation of our financial statements involves judgments, estimates and assumptions, and changes in financial accounting standards may cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.” For a discussion of the_ effects of the adoption of IFRS 16 on our financial condition and results of operations, see “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Adoption of IFRS 16” and note 2.4 to the 2019 Financial Statements._ After the completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group will not prepare separate consolidated financial statements and we instead intend to report our consolidated financial results at the level of the Parent.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Simpel EBITDA adjustment consisted of (i) pre-acquisition EBITDA of Simpel of €22.6 million, (ii) pro forma application of the estimated impact of IFRS 16 in the amount of €1.5 million and (iii) an intercompany adjustment for the reclassification of interconnect activities in respect of certain users that were, pre-acquisition, users on both TMNL and Simpel networks and are post-acquisition consolidated in TMNL’s financial statements, in the amount of €(5.5) million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Simpel EBITDA adjustment consisted of (i) pre-acquisition EBITDA of Simpel of €24.8 million, (ii) pro forma application of the estimated impact of IFRS 16 in the amount of €1.1 million and (iii) an intercompany adjustment for the reclassification of interconnect activities in respect of certain users that were, pre-acquisition, users on both TMNL and Simpel networks and are post-acquisition consolidated in TMNL’s financial statements, in the amount of €(1.1) million. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, the Simpel EBITDA adjustment consisted of (i) pre-acquisition EBITDA of Simpel of €3.2 million, (ii) pro forma application of the estimated impact of IFRS 16 in the amount of €0.2 million and (iii) an intercompany adjustment for the reclassification of interconnect activities in respect of certain users that were, preacquisition, users on both TMNL and Simpel networks and are post-acquisition consolidated in TMNL’s financial statements, in the amount of €(0.1) million. (c) On September 1, 2018, we completed the demerger of part of our passive equipment and part of our rented sites to T-Infra. TInfra was transferred to Deutsche Telekom on January 1, 2019, and ceased to form part of our consolidated financial results from that date. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the T-Infra EBITDA adjustment consisted of (i) eliminating the reported (negative) EBITDA of T-Infra (demerged business) of €17.9 million, (ii) inclusion of lease costs with other operating expenses of €(51.9) million in connection with the continuing MLA and (iii) pro forma application of the estimated impact of IFRS 16 in the amount of €51.9 million. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2018, the TMNL management reclassifications consisted of (i) pro forma application of the estimated impact of IFRS 16 in the amount of €36.1 million, (ii) pre-acquisition period interconnect revenues that were reclassified from TMNL to Simpel in the amount of €2.1 million, (iii) consolidation entry between TMNL and Simpel relating to wholesale fees in the amount of €(6.0) million and (iv) consolidation entry between TMNL and Tele2 in the amount of €(0.8) million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the TMNL management reclassifications consisted of (i) pre-acquisition period interconnect revenues that were reclassified from TMNL to Simpel in the amount of €5.5 million and (ii) consolidation entry between TMNL and Simpel relating to wholesale fees in the amount of €1.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the TMNL management reclassifications mainly consisted of (i) pre-acquisition period interconnect revenues that were reclassified from TMNL to Simpel in the amount of €1.1 million, (ii) management’s estimates for alignment of IFRS 16 assumptions for the T-Infra MLA contract in the amount of €0.3 million and (iii) an incremental ----- amount of €(14.9) million in order to adjust for the difference between preliminary statutory adjustments and final statutory adjustments. The difference in preliminary and final statutory adjustments is attributable to accounting differences in the treatment of the bad debt provision, mass claim provision, SAR provision, lease incentive provisions and IFRS 16 positions as a result of final year-end closing procedures and audit adjustments. Management has assessed the differences on a case-bycase basis and concluded that while relevant for statutory financial statements, these are non-representative for the recurring trend of pro forma adjusted EBITDA or Underlying EBITDA for which these fluctuations represent one-off events or differences in a given period and should be phased or time corrected to another (earlier) period. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, the TMNL management reclassifications mainly consisted of (i) preacquisition period interconnect revenues that were reclassified from TMNL to Simpel in the amount of €0.1 million, (ii) management’s estimates for alignment of IFRS 16 assumptions for the T-Infra MLA contract in the amount of €0.1 million and (iii) an incremental amount of €30.0 million in order to adjust for the difference between preliminary statutory adjustments and final statutory adjustments. The difference in preliminary and final statutory adjustments is attributable to accounting differences in the treatment of the bad debt provision, mass claim provision, SAR provision, lease incentive provisions and IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 positions as a result of final year-end closing procedures and audit adjustments. Management has assessed the differences on a case-by-case basis and concluded that while relevant for statutory financial statements, these are nonrepresentative for the recurring trend of pro forma adjusted EBITDA or Underlying EBITDA for which these fluctuations represent one-off events or differences in a given period and should be phased or time corrected to another (earlier) period. (e) Represents adjustments for certain one-off costs primarily related to pre- and post-acquisition integration and restructuring costs related to the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions and consisting primarily of advisory costs/support, network integration costs and severance costs. (f) Reflects an adjustment to exclude the estimated impact of IFRS 16, thereby including operating lease expenses in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in order to arrive at a closer alignment with cash EBITDA. (g) Represents certain items, which management believes are one-off and/or non-recurring items, primarily related to: (i) €7.7 million of temporary effects in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, €0.7 million of early termination fees for shops, one-off fine of €1.4 million imposed by the Dutch ACM, €1.8 million of advisory fees related to the sale of Simpel incurred during the pre-acquisition period, €(0.4) million of release of a previous accrual in Simpel’s pre-acquisition accounts, €0.5 million of reversal of an out of period accrual release attributable to a discount to a wholesale partner in 2020, €0.7 million of accrual policy change regarding catch-up carrier costs, €0.3 million of correct phasing of B2B activation costs in connection with IFRS 15, €0.7 million of correct phasing of installation cost accruals, €(0.3) million of double-booked bad debt costs during the migration of Tele2 customers from the Tele2 systems to the TMNL systems, €(0.7) million of reversal of release of a previous over-accrual provision in connection with Eurofiber, €0.8 million of one-off correction for administrative costs related to recognition of VAT on electronic payments for prepaid credits, €(1.1) million of release of over-accruals for cost of goods sold and supplier invoices in the fixed segment, €(14.9) million of release of a COVID-related bad debt provision in the third quarter of 2021 which led to a positive one-off COVID-19 impact on Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. These one-off or non-recurring items have been calculated based on management estimates, which we believe are reasonable. The COVID-19-related effects of €7.7 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 primarily comprised of temporary effects on revenues and contribution margin, mainly driven by customer behavior such as reduced mobility, reduced roaming charges due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions and reduced out-of-bundle usage by customers. Furthermore, we also experienced temporarily high costs due to high utilization of call centers with our shops being closed, and additional costs for home delivery of handsets, which negatively impacted profitability.

In 2017, TMNL introduced the SAR scheme to offer eligible employees the option to participate in an increase in the enterprise value. The full amount of expenses related to the SAR scheme has been adjusted to provide details on the EBITDA generation of TMNL and enhance comparability with equity based/non-cash incentive schemes.

Certain run-rate synergies have already been realized in 2021, such as mobile site rental reduction as a result of site consolidation (both to reduce interference and where excess sites not needed), marketing and call center synergies and other synergies (including bad debt, centralization of procurement functions and the Simpel management team). (c) Represents management estimates of further planned unrealized synergies potential in respect of both Tele2 and Simpel, including in connection with Tele2, potential synergies in respect of bad debt collections (representing improved client acceptance and collection practices implemented upon integration with TMNL), direct and indirect cost savings related to the discontinuance of the Tele2 network and the cancellation of leased telecommunications towers, reduction in marketing expenses as a result of mobile cross-selling, optimization of campaigning periods, reduction in other indirect costs such as personnel related costs as well as legal audit and tax fees.

These measures have included mandatory closure of businesses, social distancing requirements and travel restrictions, which have severely diminished the level of economic activity around the world and in The Netherlands and have caused significant volatility in financial markets and triggered a period of global economic slowdown, the extent and duration of which are currently uncertain. In The Netherlands, according to CBS, Dutch gross domestic product (“GDP”) declined by 1.7% during the first quarter of 2020 and by 8.5% in the second quarter of 2020, each relative to the previous quarter. Growth in The Netherlands has oscillated since the second quarter of 2020, reaching 7.8% in the third quarter of 2020, then declining by 0.1% and 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, respectively, and increasing by and 3.1% in the second quarter of 2021, each in comparison to the previous quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic and the multiple waves of infections that have been recorded have severely impacted the economies of the European Union, including The Netherlands. In particular, the World Bank registered a contraction for the Euro area’s real GDP of 6.4% in 2020 and forecasts deeper continuing impacts on those economies dependent on international tourism as well as those dependent on international trade, as supply bottlenecks persist (Source: World Bank). In The Netherlands, employment and working hours were negatively impacted, with the unemployment rate increasing by approximately 1.5% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2020 and total working hours decreasing. After the lockdown in mid-March, hours worked per week fell by 18%, or 6 hours per week by May of 2020 (Source: Institute of Labor Economics, Drivers of _Working Hours and Household Income Dynamics during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Case of The Netherlands). COVID-19 caseload waves and concomitant containment measures were associated with_ exceptional declines in consumer spending in two waves in 2020, reaching 17% and 12% declines in consumer spending year-over-year in April and December of 2020, respectively (Source: CBS). The European Commission expects the Dutch economy to rebound in the second and third quarters of 2021, leading to real GDP growth of 3.3% year-over-year for both 2021 and 2022 (Source: European Commission, Summer 2021 _Economic forecast for Netherlands), but there can be no assurance that these recovery rates will be achieved._ Economic slowdown due to further waves of COVID-19 may result in additional or more drastic preventive measures being imposed, which in turn may result in further declines in consumer disposable income and spending as well as consumer confidence. These economic effects may in turn cause increases in customer payment defaults and bad debt in respect of both our business and retail customers, and they may also cause our business customers to delay or forego decisions to use our services, all of which may adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. In response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we closed all our retail shops on March 16, 2020. We reopened some of our shops on a shop-in-a-box concept a few days later, and by June 2020 we had reopened ----- all our shops. However, under renewed Dutch government containment measures, we closed all our shops again on December 15, 2020 and gradually restarted services in shops as of February 2021, with the shops fully open as of April 28, 2021. Such measures have had an impact in the general financial condition of the companies and workforce in The Netherlands. They have also had an impact on our business in particular as retail footprint is an important sales channel for us, especially for the T-Mobile brand. Such closures may have affected, and may in the future affect if they are re-imposed, important metrics such as gross adds in mobile and fixed services, or may otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results, financial conditions and prospects. On November 12, 2021, the Dutch government announced a new set of COVID-19 containment measures by which, as of November 13, 2021, bars, restaurants, clothing shops and other non-essential shops and services are required to be closed from during certain hours, gatherings at home are limited, and sporting events will be held without spectators, among other measures. In response to continued high infection rates in the Netherlands, on November 26, 2021, the Dutch government announced that these measures would tighten as of November 28, 2021, for an additional three weeks at least, with non-essential shops to close between 5 PM and 5 AM daily and supermarkets to close at 8 PM daily. In addition, the Dutch government has prescribed guidelines to maintain social distancing in shops and outlets and other mitigating measures in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which may impact our ability to carry out our business and operations at normal capacity. Terminal equipment sales, renewal and new contracts could decrease due to the additional measures announced on November 12 and November 26, 2021, or due to any further temporary COVID-19-related closures or restricted hours of our retail shops or due to decrease in customer demand as a result of such measures and closures. These and similar measures may also delay the completion of our capital or infrastructure construction projects and other operations and maintenance activities, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See “—The _continuity of our services strongly depends on the proper functioning of our IT and network infrastructure and any failure of this infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business.”_ While we believe our operations are currently in compliance with applicable guidance, if customers perceive our implementation of these measures to be inadequate or ineffective, we may experience lower than expected activity at the retail stores or suffer damage to our reputation, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, our customers’ ability or desire to visit our physical premises may remain weak for a significant length of time. This would affect sales of hardware such as handsets, tablets and other accessories and other in-store purchases such as top-ups, and would also impede our ability to capture new customers. Furthermore, the self-isolation measures imposed by the Dutch government in order to combat COVID-19 have led to changing patterns of internet and mobile services usage. For example, mobile calling and fixed data traffic tended to increase during lockdowns and decrease once lockdown restrictions ended. If the Dutch government were to impose new or different containment measures, consumer patterns of interest and mobile services usage may change in ways we cannot predict and which could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations. Lastly, the severe national and international travel restrictions implemented in order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic spread have also contributed to diminishing the level of economic activity in The Netherlands, including tourism and leisure (significant contributors to the Dutch economy), which could negatively impact our retail sales, including revenue from roaming services that have decreased as a consequence of travel restrictions, as well as consumer confidence, investment by business and the Dutch economy more broadly, which could in turn adversely affect our sales to both residential and business customers across channels. Additionally, further variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may mutate in ways that increase transmissibility, evade the human immune system, or bypass the protection provided by vaccines, and thereby cause governments to order travel bans and re-impose lockdowns as these variants appear. As a result of the start of the global spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the week of November 22, 2021, governments around the world began to re-impose travel bans to southern African countries that were seen as sources of the new variant, as cases of the new variant were detected that week in the UK and Belgium, among other countries. Since the severity of the disease Omicron causes and the extent to which it is more transmissible than previous widespread SARS-CoV-2 variants are presently unknown, we cannot predict the course of future lockdowns, travel bans, and other measures that may be imposed by Dutch or other governments to contain its spread or the spread of other SARS-CoV-2 which may appear in the future, all of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects. ----- Further, we cannot predict if and when customer spending and domestic travel will return to preCOVID-19 levels, and any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business on the same terms as we did prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last five years we have grown rapidly to become one of the largest telecommunications services providers in The Netherlands and we continue to pursue a growth strategy to improve our business, financial condition and results of operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor supply dislocation which has increased job vacancies in The Netherlands (Source: CBS) and which may increase our labor costs, decreased customer confidence and decreased consumer spending, could result in our failure to achieve our historical growth rates. The full impact of the pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted, the timing and ability of vaccination boosters, the effects and impact of variants on the vaccinated population, the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending, the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return to pre-COVID-19 levels and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, which are all beyond our knowledge and control. Moreover, there are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance. For these reasons, we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that COVID-19 will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including those relating to our significant levels of debt, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our debt obligations, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

We cannot assure you that conditions in the bank lending, capital and other financial markets will not continue to deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancing. We may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access and cost of financing will depend on, among others, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts, our prospects and our credit ratings. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral, which may restrict our business operations or make such debt unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. We depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our operating activities, supply capital to finance our operations and growth, make capital expenditure and manage our debt levels. The continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and could adversely affect our ability to make payments of future interest and other payments with respect to our indebtedness and other obligations, including payments on the Notes and to fund capital expenditures, which could negatively impact the quality of our service, our competitiveness and customer satisfaction, which could in turn have a negative impact on our revenue, operating profit and cash flows. In addition, since we have fixed costs which we cannot significantly or rapidly decrease when demand for our products or services decreases, such as personnel costs and costs related to our infrastructure, any resulting decline in our revenue, particularly in the event of a future resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a material adverse effect on our net cash flows, margins and profits. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,We face significant competition in each of the business segments in which we operate and competitive pressures and shifting customer preferences could have a material adverse impact on our business.,"The Dutch telecommunications market is dynamic and competitive pressure may undercut our business, materially negatively affecting our business, revenue and prospects. We operate in highly competitive markets and we face significant competition in our industry which has resulted in ARPU that historically has been, until recently, generally declining in the important B2C mobile segment across our industry. In The Netherlands, the three main providers in the telecommunications sector are TMNL, KPN and VFZ. VFZ and KPN currently lead the fixed internet market. We are the largest mobile telecommunications operator in The Netherlands, as measured by number of SIMs and by revenue in the B2C mobile segment. For our mobile and our fixed services, our competitors include, but are not limited to, KPN and VFZ. In addition, our mobile services face competition from OTT services providers and MVNOs while our fixed services also compete with alternative providers such as Delta, Online.nl and in B2B, Eurofiber, as well as fixed virtual network operators. For our wholesale services, our key competitors include, but are not limited to, wholesale providers of voice, data and fiber services. We may also face increased competition in any of these business segments as a result of new market entrants, or legacy operators may seek to leverage their market position to compete with us in new territories or service areas. For instance, KPN or VFZ may aggressively compete with us in our mobile business in response to our attempts to gain market share in fixed internet services. Competition from such companies, as well as from new entrants and new technologies, could create downward pressure on prices across all the business lines, which could result in a decrease in ARPU, a loss of customers or revenue generation units and a decrease in revenue and profitability. In addition, technological developments are increasing cross-competition in certain markets, such as that between mobile and fixed-line telephony. In some instances, our competitors may have easier access to financing, more comprehensive product ranges, lower financial leverage, greater financial, technical, marketing and personnel resources, larger subscriber bases, wider geographical coverage for their networks, greater brand name recognition and experience or longer established relationships with regulatory authorities, suppliers and customers. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory burdens with which they are required to comply because, among other reasons, they use different technologies to provide their services or are not subject to obligations applicable to operators with significant market power. Traditional telecommunications operators may develop an expansion policy with their main or secondtier brands based on large price discounts that generally affect all operators in the market. Certain of our main competitors in The Netherlands may have greater financial capacity than us. This could be used to undercut competing businesses, including us, or to invest in infrastructure or other assets that would enable our traditional competitors to become more competitive in the market. In order to increase our postpaid subscriber base, we must either migrate our existing prepaid mobile customers to a postpaid plan, attract our competitors’ existing subscribers or attract new customers who did not have a mobile telecommunications subscription before. We may face a declining rate at which we can continue to migrate our existing prepaid customers to postpaid plans as the prepaid base decreases consistently over time, or we may not be successful in attracting new subscriptions, or attempting to attract our competitors’ existing subscribers may intensify the competitive pressures that we are subject to. We cannot guarantee that our historical positive net adds numbers and leading customer satisfaction ratings (as confirmed by our increasing TRI*M scores over the last decade, where TRI*M is a customer satisfaction metric widely adopted within the Deutsche Telekom Group) will continue in the future. In addition, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, since the first half of 2020, the level of competition has increased as many of our competitors have launched new promotions and offers in an attempt to tackle worsening economic conditions and declining consumer spending, such as KPN’s Unlimited mobile promotion and fixed line portfolio changes from KPN and VFZ. Such initiatives may adversely affect ARPU, including as a result of any potential customer retention campaigns that we may undertake in response to such strong market competitive intensity. Our competitors could gain competitive advantages over us through leveraging their more extensive fixed internet networks or through joint ventures and alliances among franchises or financial investors, wireless or private cable operators, satellite providers, local exchange carriers and other telecommunications service ----- providers in The Netherlands that could give them increased access to financing, resources, efficiencies of scale or the ability to provide multiple services in direct competition with us. Public-private joint ventures may also increase competition. Any of these advantages that our competitors may hold or come to hold could make it difficult for us to compete, for instance by making our FMC bundles less attractive relative to our competitors’ and thereby siphoning away customers from our mobile base, negatively impacting our business, revenue, and prospects. In our capacity as wholesale seller of mobile services, we have an arrangement with MVNOs who rely on our network to provide services for their own customers. An MVNO arrangement generally provides less revenue and lower margins than our other services, and as a result, a potential increase in market share of MVNOs may reduce our margins and revenue if we fail to increase our own market share in the mobile market. In addition, aggressive pricing from MVNOs on our network or on other networks and pressure from MVNOs on our network for contract terms that are more favorable to them could also increase the competitive pressure and cause our results of operations to decline. If we are unable to compete effectively with MVNOs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The success of our business model is based on our service quality and the products currently offered in the market as well as on continual renewal and updating of our product and service range in accordance with the requirements and changes that arise in a highly competitive market. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we become uncompetitive as a result of failing to keep pace with changing technology and consumer preferences. Any delay or absence in introducing a product or service range that is at least similar to what is being offered by our main competitors could lead us to lose our competitive position in the market and, consequently, to a decrease of our current market share, which would have a negative impact on our revenue, operating profit and cash flows. In addition, maintaining and developing our infrastructure and the range and quality of our services to remain competitive in the market requires significant capital expenditure on an ongoing basis, which could negatively impact our profitability in future periods. For instance, to remain competitive we will occasionally need to bid for spectrum allocations at government auctions, such as at the planned 3.5 GHz 5G spectrum auction that the Dutch government is planning for 2022. See “—Our business is capital intensive and our capital _expenditures may not generate a positive return.” Our inability, for any reason, to fund our capital expenditure_ in the future could negatively impact the quality of our service, our competitiveness and customer satisfaction, which could have a negative impact on our revenue, operating profit and cash flows. New providers of mobile data and telephony services may enter the market and may benefit from more effective or lower cost technologies that give them a competitive advantage over us in these markets. In particular, we are facing increasing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on new mobile VoIP, in particular OTT services, such as Facebook Messenger, FaceTime, Google Talk, Skype, Snapchat, Viber and WhatsApp. These OTT services are often free of charge, accessible via smartphones and allow their users to have access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services over the internet, thus bypassing more expensive traditional voice and messaging services (SMS/MMS) provided by MNOs like us, who are only able to charge the internet data usage for such services. With the growing share of smartphone users in the Dutch mobile subscriber base, there are an increasing number of customers using OTT services. All MNOs are currently competing with OTT services providers who leverage existing infrastructure and are often not required to implement capital-intensive business models associated with traditional mobile network operators like us. OTT service providers have in recent years become more sophisticated, and technological developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech quality. In addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple Inc. (“Apple”), Google Inc. (“Google”), Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Facebook”) and Microsoft Corporation, have turned their attention to the provision of OTT services. In the long-term, if non-traditional mobile voice and data services or similar services continue to increase in popularity and if we, or more generally all the MNOs, are not able to address this competition, this could cause declines in subscriber base and profitability across all of our products and services, among other material adverse effects. In addition, we may face increasing competition from a large-scale rollout of public Wi-Fi networks by local governments and utilities, transportation service providers, new and existing Wi-Fi telecommunications operators and others, which particularly benefits OTT services. Enhanced fixed service infrastructure access and mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing ----- to customers, and new technologies may enable our competitors to offer not only new or technologically superior services, but to also offer existing standard services at lower prices. For example, in areas with slow mobile internet service but broadband coverage, the availability of OTT services may negatively impact the demand for mobile services subscriptions. The telecommunications services industry has undergone significant technological development over time and these changes continue to affect our business. Such changes have had, and will continue to have, a profound impact on consumer expectations and behavior. Our products and services are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. We may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments. See “—If we fail to successfully adopt new technologies or services, or to respond to _technological developments, our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover the cost of investments that we have made.”_ Any inability or unwillingness to respond effectively to such competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Accordingly, our results may be adversely impacted by negative economic, legal or political developments in The Netherlands, or by our failure to anticipate the needs and preferences of Dutch consumers in terms of our marketing, service portfolio and strategic investments. Any adverse developments, or even uncertainties, in this regard may adversely affect our business, financial position, cash flows and results of operations. A deterioration in economic conditions in The Netherlands as a result, for example, of changes in government policy, a further deterioration in global economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see also “—The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our _business is uncertain and its effect on the Dutch economy and our customers’ behavior constitutes a threat to our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects” and “—The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the Dutch and the global economy and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of unknown magnitude and duration, which may impact our liquidity and access to capital” above) or a regional or global recession, could reduce or limit the growth of consumers’_ disposable income. All these factors could have a negative impact on our sales of new services and hardware and lead some of our customers to default on their telephone, broadband and/or television bills, thus negatively impacting our revenue. There is also a risk that financing conditions will tighten for both private and public sectors in Europe, or in The Netherlands in particular, as a result of renewed uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of public finances in certain European countries, recession or other macroeconomic developments, which could increase our cost of financing or limit our access to financing in the future, which could limit our ability to pursue new acquisitions, improve and expand our infrastructure or otherwise implement our business plan. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are several potential sources of economic uncertainty which could adversely affect the Dutch economy in particular. For example, the Dutch economy has experienced volatility in recent years, including due to fundamental political changes to the European Union and trade uncertainties as a result of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Additionally, Dutch market risk arises as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, increasing gas and energy costs and others.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.5,"Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, including the risk that we may not be able to integrate newly acquired operations into our business, which may prevent us from realizing the strategic and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and thus adversely affect our business.","Historically, our business has grown, in part, through a number of selective acquisitions and joint ventures that have enabled us to take advantage of existing networks, service offerings and management expertise. In the period from 2016 to 2020 in particular, we acquired three complementary businesses. In ----- December 2016, we acquired from VFZ the fixed-line business unit in The Netherlands, then known as Vodafone Thuis and since rebranded as T-Mobile Thuis, which has enabled us to offer FMC B2C packages that combine internet, television and fixed telephone. In January 2019, we acquired Tele2 from Tele2 Sweden, which added over one million B2C SIMs and over 300,000 B2C and B2B fixed subscribers to our business. In December 2020, by acquiring Complex Bidco B.V., we acquired Simpel, which added a budget brand with over one million B2C SIMs. In April 2021, we entered into an agreement to serve as the anchor tenant of a new fiber network that is projected to extend to over one million homes passed in The Netherlands by Roots OpCo B.V. (“Open Dutch Fiber”), a joint venture between KKR and DTCP. In May 2019, we entered into an agreement with Primevest Capital Partners and Koninklijke VolkerWessels B.V (“VolkerWessels”) by which we will serve as an anchor tenant on an FTTH, a high-speed internet network that Primevest Capital Partners and Volker Wessels will build. Following the pilot of this partnership in The Hague’s Segbroek area, the consortium will build fiber networks in The Hague’s Loosduinen area as well as Eindhoven and Rotterdam. This network is expected to extend to over 130,000 homes passed by mid-2022. We may undertake further acquisitions, joint ventures or other synergistic transactions in the future, in addition to pursuing organic growth through increased customer numbers and increased penetration of our services and products among our existing customer base. Any acquisition, disposal or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result in us incurring additional debt or contingent liabilities, in addition to post-completion liabilities, increased interest expenses and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets. In particular, any target that we acquire may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigations. We may learn of additional information about the target companies that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we could become liable for overdue payables to suppliers and employees that are not known to us at the time of the acquisition, or we could become subject to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of which we underestimated. In conducting our due diligence, we rely on resources available to us, including public information and information provided by the sellers and third-party advisers. In addition, our due diligence usually provides for materiality thresholds, a limited scope and a restricted perimeter. There can be no assurance that the due diligence we undertake reveals or highlights all relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating future acquisitions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during the due diligence exercise. The due diligence process is inherently subjective. If the due diligence investigation failed to identify material information regarding the business we plan to acquire, we may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan or incur impairment or other charges. Similarly, the materialization of certain risks, which may or may not have been identified during due diligence, may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and, potentially, subsequent contractual and statutory liability to various parties. Any of these events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes. Furthermore, the acquisitions of certain companies may constitute a change of control under agreements entered into by such companies, and may entitle these third parties to terminate their agreements with us or, in some cases, request adjustments and financing arrangements of the terms of the agreements. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of these third parties may exercise their termination, adjustment or other rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position following any such acquisition. In addition, some of the third parties may use their termination or adjustment rights to renegotiate the terms of the agreements to our detriment and may benefit from stronger bargaining power, as a result of which the acquired company may only be able to secure replacement contracts on less favorable terms or at all. In addition, it cannot be guaranteed that we will have sufficient resources to fund any acquisitions in the future, which would limit our growth potential, or we may use available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions, which may impact our ability to make capital expenditures or payments on the Notes. We may experience difficulties in integrating the businesses we acquire into our business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of such acquisitions, or fail to retain key customers, employees and management personnel of the relevant targets. For example, we may fail to achieve the anticipated operational synergies under our acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel or our separation from ----- Deutsche Telekom, or the costs we incur in trying to realize these synergies and other benefits described herein may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh any benefit. Further, the anticipated total run-rate synergy potential of €139 million by 2024 which we have identified in respect of Tele2 and Simpel, may not be achievable within the anticipated timelines or at all and there may be significant costs associated with achieving such synergies. Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. Further, the attention of our managers may be distracted from existing operations by such acquisition processes and the integration of the acquired businesses, especially for material acquisitions. Such acquisitions may also raise regulatory compliance issues. We may face difficulty integrating a newly-acquired company into our data protection compliance framework, and we may become liable for regulatory compliance issues with respect to the acquired company relating to events that took place before our acquisition of it. For example, in September 2019, we were fined by the ACM for alleged violations of our website information obligations that in part related to Tele2’s website offerings in a period both before and after we completed our acquisition of Tele2. For further information, see “—Risks Relating to Legislative and _Regulatory Matters—We face risks arising from the outcome of various criminal, civil, administrative and regulatory proceedings.” Thus, if we consummate any further acquisitions or fail to integrate previous_ acquisitions, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing business acquisitions or integrating previously acquired companies. In addition, our debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future transactions, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations. Acquisitions or disposals of additional telecommunications companies may require the approval of governmental authorities (either domestically or at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process which could result in a failure to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we analyze and conduct due diligence on acquisition targets, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations and our inquiries may fail to uncover relevant information. There can be no assurance that our assessments or due diligence of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations, especially in light of the severe economic uncertainty and unpredictability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities. Our competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring businesses that we target to the benefit of our competitors. For further information regarding our acquisitions and joint ventures, see “Summary—Overview,” “Business—Material Contracts” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Demerger and Other Arrangements.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.6,Our business is capital intensive and our capital expenditures may not generate a positive return.,"Our business is capital intensive and requires significant levels of investment. Like other companies in the fixed line, mobile and internet services sector, we must continually invest in order to develop, expand and maintain our network infrastructure. Although we maintain what we believe is a sufficient budget for capital expenditures, our business demands significant capital expenditures to improve, expand and maintain our networks and improve the scope and quality of our service, including expenditures relating to equipment and labor. We incur significant capital expenses for the deployment of new technologies, for the purchase of frequencies and the deployment of network infrastructure for our mobile operations and for our fixed line operations. In particular, obtaining access to 3.5 GHz 5G spectrum through the Dutch government auction planned for 2022 (subject to possible delays) would likely require significant capital expenditure on our part, as measured against industry benchmarks. For further discussion of the planned 2022 5G spectrum auction, see ----- “—Our existing services’ future network capacity growth may be constrained by the frequency spectrum _available to us.” With respect to fixed internet services, although we do not own our own network and are not_ responsible for investment in the passive infrastructure of the networks that we use, namely KPN’s copper, fiber WBA or optical distribution framework (“ODF”) access networks, along with the Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest fiber networks, provision of fixed internet services to our customers will require investments in customer premises equipment such as modems, routers and TV equipment. Although we do not presently anticipate a need to build our own fixed network, in order to effectively compete against our competitors in The Netherlands, it remains possible that in the future we may also need to build our own such network, for example, a fiber optic network. Such unanticipated future needs could involve significant expenditures. We may also need to make investments to provide business continuity and to meet requirements for information security and disaster recovery, all of which could require significant capital expenditures which could be further increased by applicable regulations requiring increased levels of the technical protection of telecommunications networks. In addition, costs associated with the licenses and spectrums that we need to operate our existing networks and technologies and those that we may acquire or develop in the future, as well as costs and rental expenses related to their deployment, could be significant. The amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our current estimates due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. See also “—Our existing services’ future network capacity growth may be constrained by the _frequency spectrum available to us.”_ Furthermore, new technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make additional investments to increase the capacity of their infrastructures. It cannot be guaranteed that we will continue to have sufficient resources to maintain the quality of our network and our other products and services, or to expand our network coverage, which are key elements for our strategy and growth over the long-term. Unforeseen investment expenses, an inability to generate sufficient cash flows and/or finance our capital expenditure needs at an acceptable cost or an inability to make profitable investments could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

We cannot provide any assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt obligations when due, sustain our operations or meet our other capital requirements. Our ability to generate cash flow and to finance our capital expenditures, current operations and debt service obligations depends on numerous factors, including: - our future operating performance; - the demand and price levels for our current and projected products and services; - our ability to maintain the level of technical capacity required on our networks and the subscriber equipment and other pertinent equipment connected to our networks; - our ability to successfully introduce new products and services; - our ability to limit customer churn; - the general economic conditions and other circumstances affecting consumer spending; - competition; - sufficient distributable reserves, in accordance with applicable law; and ----- - legal, tax and regulatory developments affecting our business. Some of these factors are beyond our control. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows, we might not be able to repay our debt, expand our business, respond to competitive challenges or finance our cash and capital requirements, including capital expenditures. If we are not able to meet our debt service obligations, we might have to sell off assets, attempt to restructure or refinance our existing debt or seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.9,Our existing services’ future network capacity growth may be constrained by the frequency spectrum available to us.,"Mobile network capacity is to a certain extent limited by the amount of frequency spectrum available for its use. Since the Dutch government controls the allocation of frequency spectrum to telecommunications operators in The Netherlands, the capacity of our mobile network is limited by the amount of spectrum that we are able to procure via public auction or private sale. We cannot assure you that we will be able to procure more spectrum, renew spectrum upon the expiry of our spectrum licenses or otherwise maintain our existing spectrum licenses, including as a result of our non-compliance with any commitments pursuant to concession agreements. See also “—Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters—Any failure to comply with license _conditions may jeopardize our licenses, which are required to operate our business and our networks.”_ As spectrum auctions are infrequent and spectrum licenses are of long duration, and we may anticipate a need for additional spectrum in order to secure future capacity, we may therefore participate in future spectrum auctions even though we might not, at the time of the auction, require additional spectrum capacity. Such participation would require significant capital expenditures upon participation in the auction, due in part to the fact that spectrum availability is limited and the process for obtaining it is complex, both of which tend to make spectrum licenses expensive. For a description of mobile spectrum licenses we currently own, see “Business— _Licenses.”_ In particular, to accommodate anticipated customer growth and our provision of 5G services over the next five years, we believe that we may need to obtain sufficient 5G spectrum allocation from the auction of 3.5 GHz spectrum that the Dutch government had planned for April 2022, but which is likely to be delayed. We plan to participate in that auction when it occurs. However, it is still uncertain both when the 3.5 GHz spectrum auction will take place and when the licenses to be distributed in that auction would become operational. On June 30, 2021, in the course of a lawsuit brought by Inmarsat Solutions B.V., the Rotterdam district court issued an interim injunction that has suspended the change in the National Frequency Plan associated with the planned 3.5 GHz spectrum auction. The main proceedings of this suit are expected to occur in the course of 2021 and a decision is expected in the first half of 2022, subject to possible delays. As the auction cannot occur until the proceedings are resolved, a delay in the auction is likely. Additionally, the date on which the spectrum licenses from this planned auction would become operational, currently scheduled for September 1, 2022, may also be delayed. We cannot predict the length of the delay in the auction or in the date on which the licenses from the auction will become operational. Any such delays could constrain our future network capacity growth as well as our business and prospects. Furthermore, even if the auction were to take place in 2022, whether we acquire a sufficient spectrum allotment as well as the consideration required for that allotment both depend upon a competitive bidding process, and success is not guaranteed. ----- We may also need additional spectrum to accommodate future customer growth or to further develop our mobile internet services, and the quality of spectrum available to us may affect our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional spectrum that would meet our expectations or business needs on a timely basis, which could affect our network expansion or upgrade plans. This could in turn constrain our future network capacity growth and our market share, which would in turn materially and adversely affect our business and prospects as well as our financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.10,"Our growth prospects depend on continued demand for fixed line, mobile and broadband products and services and increased demand for bundled and premium offerings.","The use of the internet, television and fixed line telephony and mobile communication services in The Netherlands has increased in recent years. We have benefited from this growth and our growth and profitability depend, in part, on continued demand for these services in the coming years. We rely in part on our ability to market mobile, TV, broadband, unified communication and other Information and Communications Technology (“ICT”) partner services as well as a combination of these services through bundled offerings to attract new customers and to migrate existing customers to such services. If demand for such products and services does not increase as expected, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if the use of telecommunication services increases more than expected (as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other unexpected event), the increase in traffic would require prompt action on our end to expand our network’s capacity so as to ensure connectivity and be able to successfully meet the increased demand for our services. If we are unable to meet such increasing demand, we may lose existing or potential customers to our competitors. Additionally, any substantial increase of customer demand for data traffic, in particular broadband data traffic, over forecast levels could result in increased additional costs of making services available to our customers, which, despite synergies arising from acquisitions (such as that of Tele2) or efficiencies resulting from increased scale, could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our business In addition, there is a risk that new technologies may undermine demand for our services. For example, new wireless internet services being developed by Amazon, SpaceX or other providers could reduce demand for fixed line broadband and telephony in the future. Furthermore, the products and services we offer may be more successful than we anticipate, and we may be unable to meet the demand for our product offerings. We are also affected by shifts in consumer preferences, which continue to evolve rapidly to respond to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it is possible that customers could come to rely more on VoIP and OTT services as a substitute for traditional voice and messaging services. If these consumer trends continue, the growing demand for such services could threaten our competitive advantage and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

The antennas we use for our network are generally built on land owned by third parties, the use of which is secured by way of lease agreements. In particular, we have (directly or through Cignal Infrastructure) entered into various lease arrangements relating to certain locations where our nodes are situated, as we only own the sites for part of the nodes that deliver our services to our customer base. These agreements have been entered into with various landlords and are crucial for our business. There can be no guarantee that these agreements will be extended or renegotiated on commercially favorable terms upon the expiration of their respective terms, or that they will be extended at all. If it is not possible to renew the current lease agreements for antenna sites and/or to enter into new lease agreements for suitable alternate antenna sites, this could have a negative impact on the coverage of our network. Additionally, some of the equipment used in our network is installed on customer premises. Disputes with these customers or legal proceedings involving their property may subject this equipment to encumbrances or cause it to be inaccessible, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our network in those areas. Further, our inability to successfully and timely resolve such disputes could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. ----- Furthermore, certain regulatory approvals, such as new build permits, may be required to operate antenna sites with other frequencies/frequency bands, in particular where the shift is made from a higher frequency band (e.g. 2100 MHz) to a lower frequency band (e.g. 1800 MHz) and new technologies such as 5G and adaptive antennas. To the extent that we seek to operate antenna sites with other frequencies/frequency bands and technologies, failure to obtain such regulatory approvals could have a negative impact on the future coverage or capacity of our network and/or the availability of certain technologies in the areas concerned. Current initiatives from certain activist groups against 5G deployment and the construction of more antennas with higher frequency emissions, and the reaction of some politicians and authorities on a provincial and municipal level may result in more effort and costs and a resulting delay for the roll-out of our network. This concerns not only new sites and 5G, but also impacts upgrades on existing sites and former technologies as 3G and 4G. Any such negative impact on the coverage of our network could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Therefore, operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flow and results of operations. For example, our operating costs could increase as a result of higher energy costs (whether due to increased network usage and customer traffic or higher energy prices), higher costs to attract or retain employees as a result of labor market conditions, higher payments to providers of TV services or in the event of the review and increase of the fees paid to Dutch authorities for their supervision of telecommunications activities or for our spectrum licenses. We are also affected by inflationary increases that may occur as a result of recovery of economy post COVID-19 in payment obligations under supply contracts or in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs which we may not be in a position to pass on to our customers, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Any future shortages may involve significant delays in seeking alternative supplies, may constrain our ability to meet customer demand and may result in increased customer churn. Further, in the event that hardware or software products or related services are defective, it may be difficult or impossible to enforce recourse claims against suppliers, especially if warranties included in contracts with suppliers have expired or are exceeded by those in our contracts with our subscribers in individual cases, or if the suppliers are insolvent, in whole or in part. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain the hardware, software and services we need for the operation of our business in a timely manner, at competitive terms and in adequate amounts. We also outsource some of our support services, including parts of our customer support services, information technology support, technical services and maintenance operations. For instance, we rely upon Salesforce for our customer relationship management system and B2B contract approval flow. Should any of these arrangements be terminated by either contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions to our operations, thus potentially harming our reputation, and could result in us incurring additional costs, including if the outsourcing counterparty increases pricing or if we are required to locate alternative service providers or in-source previously outsourced services. Further, we are dependent on certain suppliers with respect to our mobile services whom we may not be able to replace without incurring significant costs, such as Huawei, Eurofiber and Cignal Infrastructure. For more information about our relationship with Huawei, see “Business—Suppliers.” A cessation or interruption in the supply of the products and/or services may harm our ability to provide our mobile services to our subscribers. Among other considerations, in April 2021, Dutch mobile operators received a decision from the Dutch government on the basis of which Chinese vendors are restricted from supplying specific components to ----- the core mobile network and service platforms of Dutch telecom providers. Mobile operators have been given a transition period to replace the current equipment and the transition period is in line with TMNL’s usual replacement cycle. However, there can be no assurance that further regulatory restrictions in The Netherlands, in addition to the Telecommunications Security and Integrity Decree of November 2019 and the additional rules of October 2021 (Regeling veiligheid en integriteit telecommunicaite), will not result in restrictions on our or our commercial partners’ access to or use of such equipment and service platforms and, given the limited availability of alternative manufacturers, could limit the supply of the components necessary for development of a 5G network in The Netherlands. In particular, in the context of our 5G network deployment, it is possible that we could face a lack of supply of 5G chipsets, whether as a direct result of our inability to rely on certain suppliers or as a result of a general shortage of chipsets. Although we have preemptively ordered additional handsets in response to the chipset shortage, there is no guarantee that our efforts to mitigate the impact of such shortage will be successful. In the eventuality that the ban on Chinese suppliers is made more extensive in scope, it is also possible that we may need to replace additional equipment in our network. Our inability to rely on certain suppliers in such circumstances could negatively impact our expansion plan, including by increasing costs related to the expansion plan. In addition, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in supply chain delays and travel restrictions on our employees, contractors or suppliers, potentially for an extended period of time, which could negatively impact our ability to source equipment or services in a timely and cost effective manner. Furthermore, either directly or through buy-in as central purchasing company, we have relationships with a number of key sourcing partners for mobile network equipment, network roll-out, fixed access and software, handsets, routers and other equipment such as Eurofiber, Cignal Infrastructure, Nokia, Koning & Hartman, Ericsson and Cisco. Our ability to both maintain and renew our existing contracts with key partners and suppliers of products or services or enter into new contractual relationships with these or other suppliers upon the expiration of existing agreements, either on commercially attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and operational factors and events which may be beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these risks or a significant disruption in our supply of equipment and services from key sourcing partners could create technical problems, damage our reputation, result in the loss of customer relationships and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

More specifically, the unavailability or failure of information systems we use, our network, the production of “electronic” communications services and television, our website, and our customer service function, could significantly disrupt our business. Capital expenditure will be required to ensure sufficient security is maintained in respect of any legacy technologies we rely on as they approach the “end of life” stage of their life cycle, as well as for technologies that have been rendered obsolete as a result of technological, market or regulatory changes, and to ensure a smooth transition to supported replacements. A failure to adequately support legacy systems and to properly procure their replacement may result in a negative impact on the provision of services to customers, resulting in a loss of existing customers and making it more difficult to attract new customers, as well as an increased likelihood of data security incidents. ----- A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus or other catastrophe affecting a portion of our network could have a material adverse impact on our business and our relations with customers. For instance, fears connected with the expansion of 5G technology in The Netherlands may have contributed to several arson or sabotage attacks on several Dutch mobile towers in 2020 and 2021, including some of our own. Measures with the aim of remedying any such disasters, safety and security measures, or measures for protecting service continuity that we undertake or may undertake in the future, as well as the effects thereof on the performance of our network, could be insufficient to avoid losses. Any disaster or other damage affecting our network could result in significant uninsured losses. Our network may be subject to disruptions and to significant technological problems, and such difficulties could escalate over time. The occurrence of any such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for customers, either of which could reduce our revenue, cause us to incur additional expenses or lose customers. Our business depends on certain sophisticated critical systems, including its network operations center (“NOC”), call center and billing and customer service systems. The hardware supporting those systems is housed in a relatively small number of locations and if damage were to occur to enough of these locations (e.g., from a fire or flood) or if those systems develop other problems, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of any such event may subject us to penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators and damages, such as compensation to customers affected by long service interruptions. While we have backup systems, the risk that these systems may not be sufficient to handle a spike in activity cannot be ruled out, which could lead to a slowdown or unavailability of IT systems for a period of time. Moreover, we may incur legal penalties and reputational damages to the extent that any accident or security breach results in a loss of or damage to customers’ data or applications or the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information. Furthermore, the development of the resources used by consumers (for example, videoconferencing, telepresence, and cloud computing for business customers), of the “internet of things,” and of new terminals (such as smartphones and tablets) may result in a risk to our networks of saturation due to the large volumes of data generated by such resources. See also “—Our growth prospects depend on continued demand for fixed _line, mobile and broadband products and services and increased demand for bundled and premium offerings”_ above. Should all or some of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

For instance, in February and March of 2021, several third parties fraudulently gained access to the T-Mobile partner portal and used that access to carry out ‘SIM swaps’ in which they transferred some of our customers’ mobile phone numbers to another SIM card. Although we have taken technical and procedural measures to prevent such SIM swaps in the future, if our fraud strategies and processes are again not successful in detecting, mitigating, and preventing fraud, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operation results. This includes fraudulent activities perpetrated directly against us or through the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others.

These include sophisticated critical facilities and systems such as IP routers, exchanges, switches, transmission systems, other key network points, data centers and core billing and customer service systems. As dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased, as have the severity and sophistication of such incidents. Cyberattacks may include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for the purposes of misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, causing operational disruption and more. Our mobile and fixed networks as well as our IT systems may also become the target of cyber-attacks that could result in the unauthorized access, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, leakage or destruction of proprietary or other information, or other disruption of our business operations. For instance, like many other companies, some of our customers’ user accounts have been affected by ‘credential stuffing’ attacks in which third parties with unlawful intent use login credentials that were disclosed as a result of other data breaches unrelated to our company to gain unauthorized access to those user accounts. Although we have improved our detection and response capabilities to counter the threat of such attacks, and although we actively impress upon our customers the importance of changing passwords and of two-factor authentication, there is no effective way to prevent such attacks from successfully gaining access to user accounts in the future. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. A cyber incident involving our mobile or fixed networks, IT systems, or related infrastructure, or those of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others: - leakage or corruption of data, such as sensitive information, consumer data, configuration files etc.; - a cyber-attack on any of our networks or on a power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues; - a cyber-attack on or unauthorized access to any of our operational systems could result in operational failures or unauthorized changes to our customers’ services; - a cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt some of our operations; - a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of noncompliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties or cause delays in scheduled payments of principal or interest; - business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management and damage to our reputation. Breakdowns in IT or operating systems and security failures, such as those caused by unauthorized access to any of our computer systems or those of our business partners, may cause interruptions and damage to the systems supporting their business activity, interruption and in extreme cases even the discontinuation of telecommunications services, or loss of information, and may result in the incurrence of material costs for the recovery of such systems, which could adversely affect our costs, income, and results of operations.

If any new or enhanced technologies, products or services that we introduce fail to achieve broad market acceptance or experience technical difficulties, our revenue growth, margins and cash flows may be adversely affected. As a result, we may not recover investments that we make in order to deploy these technologies and services. Enhanced fixed service infrastructure access and mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing to customers, and new technologies may enable our competitors to offer not only new or technologically superior services, but to also offer existing standard services at lower prices. We may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments. Our ability to respond to and keep pace with technological developments may also be strained as a result of the preventive measures taken by the Dutch government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have forced many of our employees to work remotely for prolonged periods of time, thereby halting the progress of our “on-the-field” projects. It is possible that alternative technologies that are more advanced than those we currently provide may be developed. We may not obtain the expected benefits of our investments if more advanced technologies are adopted by the market. Technological developments may also shorten product life cycles and facilitate convergence of various segments in the telecommunications industry. Even if we adopt new technologies in a timely manner, the cost of such technologies may exceed their benefits. We may also be required to incur additional marketing and customer service costs in order to retain existing customers and attract them to any upgraded products and services we offer, as well as to respond to competitors’ advertising pressure, and potentially more extensive marketing campaigns, which may adversely affect our margins.

We developed our brands through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions, customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. For a description of our brands and offers, see “Business—Overview.” Our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance the image and reputation of our existing brands, products and services and to develop a favorable image and reputation for any new brands, products and services. The image and reputation of our brands, products and services may be adversely affected by several factors, including if concerns arise about (i) the quality, reliability and benefit/cost balance of our products and services, (ii) the quality of our customer service and support, (iii) our ability to deliver the level of service advertised, including in relation to connectivity and network speeds, (iv) our employees’ adherence to customer service standards, (v) managing and reducing our carbon footprint, supply chain management, and diversity, human rights, and support for local communities and (vi) our compliance with applicable laws, including privacy laws and policies regarding the processing of personal data. For example, in September 2019, the ACM fined several Dutch telecommunications companies, including us, for allegedly providing incorrect and unclear information to consumers about their offers on their websites. Additionally, we are currently being investigated by the Radiocommunications Agency Netherlands (“AT”) (Agentschap Telecom) regarding alleged breaches of data protection and/or telecommunications laws in connection with a pilot program in which we shared certain aggregated and pseudonymized customer location data with CBS under a temporary partnership with CBS that terminated at the end of 2020. We are currently awaiting receipt of the AT’s investigative report on this matter. For further details, see “Business—Legal Proceedings.” An event or series of events that threatens the reputation of one or more of our brands, or one or more of our products could have an adverse effect on the value of such brands or services and subsequent revenue therefrom. Restoring the image and reputation of our brands and services may be costly and not always possible, and re-branding in response to such events may also be costly and negatively impact our business and prospects.

We operate in an environment increasingly prone to cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity threats may include gaining unauthorized access to our systems or inserting computer viruses or malicious software in our systems to misappropriate consumer data and other sensitive information, corrupt our data or disrupt our operations or otherwise use our systems and devices to carry out any other illegal activities. Unauthorized access may also be gained through traditional means such as the theft of laptop computers, data devices and mobile phones and intelligence gathering by employees with access. Further, our employees or other persons may have unauthorized or authorized access to our systems or take actions that affect our networks in an inconsistent manner with our policies or otherwise adversely affect our ability to adequately process internal information. As a result, we need to continue to advance our capacity to identify and detect technical threats and vulnerabilities and improve our ability to react to incidents. This includes the need to strengthen security controls in the supply chain as well as to place increased focus on security measures adopted by our key partners and other third parties. In order to prevent, detect or react in a timely and efficient manner to these or similar threats, several levels of security are implemented, such as the deployment and maintenance of high-standard security technologies, a 24x7 security operations center monitoring our networks and critical applications, critical vulnerabilities remediation plan, awareness training for all employees and an incident response training. Despite all these security measures, however, new and sophisticated malware is constantly being developed and it is possible that systems are not updated on time. If unauthorized third parties manage to gain access to any of our information technology systems, or if such systems are brought down, unauthorized third parties may be able to misappropriate confidential information, cause interruptions in our operations, access our services without paying, damage our computers or otherwise damage our reputation and business. An identity and access management project is taking place to make sure that no unauthorized party gains access to our information technology systems. Intentional or unintentional (accidental employee) misuse of authorized access can occur and we have there different countermeasures in place to stop or minimize the exfiltration of confidential data, 24x7 monitoring, database encryption or privilege access management systems and policies. While we continue to invest in measures to protect our networks, as well as in procedures to allow us to respond properly to potential security breaches, any such unauthorized access to our systems could result in a loss of revenue or lead to consequences under our agreements with content providers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In such circumstances, we could be held liable or be subject to litigation, penalties (including the payment of damages and interest) or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

In the EU, we are subject to stringent regulations relating to the processing, transfer and storage of the personal data of natural persons, including, in particular, the GDPR and, in The Netherlands, the AVG (Algemene Verordening _Gegevensbescherming), which deals with the domestic implications of GDPR in The Netherlands. The GDPR_ ----- has been directly applicable in all Member States since May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation in Member States, and was implemented in the EEA countries with effect from the same date. The GDPR significantly changes the EU/EEA data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines up to 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including with respect to the collection of potential damages. The European Commission has proposed the enhanced e-Privacy Regulation, which would entail additional and stricter rules than those established under the GDPR in respect of the use of personal data from electronic communications. The e-Privacy Regulation would establish fines similar to those included in GDPR. These regulations may affect the development of innovative services that would draw on consumer data, potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for undertakings subject to both the GDPR and the e-Privacy Regulation. Regardless of the measures we adopt to protect the confidentiality and security of data, the risk of possible attacks or breaches of data processing systems remains, which could harm our reputation and give rise to penalties, fines and damages. In addition, we could be compelled to incur additional costs in order to protect against these risks or to mitigate the consequences thereof, and as an electronic communications services provider, we may be held liable for the loss, release or inappropriate modification or storage conditions of customer or other data which are carried by our network or stored on our infrastructure. The occurrence of any of these adverse events could in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, any loss of confidence on the part of our customers as a result of such events could lead to a significant decline in sales and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Should consumers’ access to mobile phone financing be more limited, or become more costly, in the future – for example as a result of adverse financial market conditions in the event of a recession or the COVID-19 pandemic causing lenders to tighten lending standards for consumer financing – consumers may be unable or unwilling to finance the purchase of handsets and other hardware from us and so may delay or alter their purchase of our products or services, negatively impacting our sales, growth capacity and the generation of cash to cover our financial obligations. See “—The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our _business is uncertain and its effect on the Dutch economy and our customers’ behavior constitutes a threat to our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.”_ In addition, as a result of the recent economic slowdown in The Netherlands and the general tightening of global financial market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be restricted in our ability to finance consumer purchases at attractive rates of interest, or at all, and may be exposed to costs related to increased rates of default under existing consumer financing arrangements. Further, the regulatory environment regarding consumer finance may change and may limit our ability to provide certain kinds of financing to consumers or may make such financing more costly in the future. As an example, in February 2021, the Dutch Minister of Finance sent a letter to Parliament reflecting an intention to revise consumer credit regulation by lowering the threshold document verification required to obtain a loan for a mobile device. Although we do not expect that this potential revision to Dutch consumer finance law would negatively affect our ability to offer attractive consumer financing as such, we cannot predict the nature or direction of future regulation. Future changes in Dutch consumer finance regulation could negatively impact our revenue, costs, growth capacity and the generation of cash to cover our financial obligations.

As we operate in certain regions in which existing infrastructure and telecommunications equipment (such as cables and mobile towers) may not be able to withstand a major natural disaster and/or in which emergency response time may be significant, prolonged recovery time could be required to resume operations. Moreover, certain regions in which we operate are particularly exposed to the developing threat of climate change and they may be affected by the environmental impact thereof, such as rising sea and air temperatures, rising sea levels, or extreme weather conditions which, in turn, could have an effect on the habitability of such territories and the cost and feasibility of providing telecommunications services.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in attracting, hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays. Competition for qualified managers and personnel in our industry is intense and there is limited availability of persons with the requisite knowledge of the telecommunications industry and relevant experience in The Netherlands and other countries where we may operate in the future. This competition for labor has intensified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and job vacancies in The Netherlands have risen in parallel with the pandemic.

We may be unable to allocate sufficient managerial and operational resources to meet our needs as our business grows, and our current operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures may become inadequate. Any weaknesses in our operational and financial systems or managerial controls and procedures may impact our ability to produce reliable financial statements and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we consider the operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures that we currently have in place to be adequate for our business, we recognize that the effectiveness of these systems, controls and procedures needs to be kept under regular review as our business grows and matures. We will have to maintain close coordination among our logistical, technical, accounting, finance, marketing and sales personnel. Management of growth will also require, among others, continued development of financial and management controls, information technology systems, customer service and legal resources. We may be unable to hire managers with the relevant expertise or the hiring process may require significant time and resources, all of which could result in a disruption in our management, growth, operational and financial systems, managerial controls and procedures and, accordingly, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

For instance, our broad network of T-Mobile-branded retail stores is an important sales channel for our T-Mobile brand whereas sales under the Simpel brand occur exclusively online. Sales under the T-Mobile, Tele2 and Ben brands also occur in significant part through online and telesales, as well as through IDS channels. Through these IDS channels, mobile products and services are sold primarily through third-party distributors including public retail outlets most of which also distribute or sell products of our competitors. Altogether in 2020, 23% of our B2C mobile transactions and 11% of our fixed gross sales occurred through IDS partners, whether through retail (8%) or through e-sales (15%). The distributors, retailers and sales agencies that we rely upon are not under our control and may stop distributing or selling our products at any time, for example as a result of financial difficulties including due to the COVID19 pandemic, or otherwise. Should this occur with particularly important distributors, retailers or agencies, we may face difficulty in finding new distributors, retailers or sales agencies that can generate the same level of revenue.

The actual or perceived risk of mobile and wireless telecommunications devices, press reports about risks or consumer litigation relating to such risks could adversely affect the size or growth rate of our subscriber base and result in decreased mobile usage or increased litigation costs. These health concerns may cause authorities in The Netherlands or in the European Union to impose stricter regulations on the construction of base stations or other telecommunications network infrastructure. In particular, public concern over actual or perceived health effects related to electromagnetic radiation may result in increased costs related to our networks, which may hinder the completion or increase the cost of network deployment, reduce the coverage of our network and hinder the commercial availability of new services. Current initiatives from certain activists groups against 5G deployment and the construction of more antennas with higher frequency emissions and the reaction of some politicians and authorities on a provincial or municipal level may have a negative impact on our network and our customer base.

Such access may in the future become more expensive to us or be terminated.","We have executed a series of non-exclusive framework agreements with KPN and affiliated companies that provide us access to their copper and fiber fixed internet networks. We are largely dependent on wholesale access to these networks. For more information about these contracts and our dependence on them, see “Business—Material Contracts—KPN Wholesale Agreements.” As a result of a March 2020 judgment by the Dutch Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal (College van _Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven) (“CBb”) annulling an ACM decision that had imposed obligations on KPN,_ KPN is no longer required, over and above the agreements we have executed with KPN, to provide us access to its copper and fiber networks. As we can no longer rely on the former regulatory framework, KPN and its affiliates could potentially discontinue access or charge prices for access without regulatory restriction. Currently, we are largely protected against price increases by certain contracts we have concluded with KPN for the wholesale access services we purchase from them and their affiliates, with the exception of the main distribution frame (“MDF”) access agreements under which we have no such price protection. Once those agreements expire, KPN could set higher prices for access to their network. In addition to the indefinite framework agreements concluded for ODF and WBA wholesale access from KPN, we have agreed with KPN a virtual unbundled local access (“VULA”) agreement for the Tele2 brand and an open wholesale model (“OWM”) agreement, as amended, for the T-Mobile brand. The VULA and OWM agreements will expire in 2023 and 2024, respectively. In the case that the VULA and OWM agreements expire without our being able to agree on new terms, we would need to rely on the indefinite WBA and ODF agreements which contain significantly higher tariffs for effectively the same type of services purchased. Further, there is no regulatory framework allowing us access to new technologies or enforcing price decreases to access them. Additionally, KPN intends to phase out the access to its copper network and replace it with fiber infrastructure, starting in 2021, and since Tele2 had obtained large-scale wholesale access to this network on an unbundled (MDF) and bundled (WBA) basis, we would need to migrate those of our customers using this access to an alternative infrastructure should the phase-out occur. The deregulation of wholesale access could allow KPN to accelerate this phase-out, and according to KPN, this phase-out would occur over a three-year period. On September 27, 2021, we initiated an interim injunction procedure to temporarily halt KPN’s planned phase-out. On November 12, 2021, the court rendered its decision and denied our request for an interim injunction. The ACM is currently reviewing two requests, on independent legal grounds, that we have made on the basis of which they could decide to restore fixed access regulation. A draft decision on our request based on the Significant Market Power (“SMP”) regime is expected by early 2022. We intend to submit an additional request to the ACM to take an emergency decision in this matter as a result of the November 12, 2021 denial of an interim injunction to stop the copper access phase-out. However, there can be no guarantee that these requests will succeed and that fixed access regulation will be re-imposed. If access regulation is not re-imposed, we could face difficulties regarding (i) obtaining wholesale access based on higher bandwidth, (ii) relying on WBA for wholesale access instead of on the basis of unbundled access in new areas or (iii) obtaining wholesale access only on unfavorable conditions which would effectively make access economically infeasible, thereby negatively impacting our ability to compete on the retail fixed market. If ACM were to grant the requests, the decision could still be appealed ad it could be a lengthy process until restrictions are re-imposed. Moreover, should fixed access regulation be re-imposed, this could occur on different, including worse, conditions as compared to past regulation, or it could be imposed only on some and not all of the wholesale services we obtain from KPN.

Such regulation and supervision, as well as future changes in laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement that affect us, our competitors or our industry, strongly influence how we operate our business. Complying with existing and future laws and regulations may increase our operating and administrative expenses, restrict our ability or make it more difficult to implement price increases, affect our ability to introduce new services, force us to change our marketing and other business practices, and/or otherwise limit our revenue. In particular, our business could be materially and adversely affected by any changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in their interpretation) regarding licensing requirements, access and price regulation, interconnection arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators or increasing competition. There can be no assurance that the provision of our services will not be subject to greater regulation in the future. Furthermore, a failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations, including those imposing reporting obligations or requiring registration and/or enrolment in lists held by competent authorities, could result in penalties, fines, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse consequences. The regulations applicable to our businesses include, among others: - obligations to provide certain information to consumers in our contractual agreements with them and through our websites, as well as to adhere to additional rules on the provision of consumer credit during and after the ordering process; - price regulation for certain of the services we offer, including regulation on roaming fees, international calling and cancellation charges; - rules promoting the elimination of surcharges for international roaming within the European Union; - rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks, including call termination, and the interconnection rates that can be charged by or to us; - “must-carry” requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carries certain broadcast stations or obtains consent to carry a broadcast station; - rules for authorizations, licensing, acquisitions, renewals and transfers of licenses and franchises; - requirements to provide or contribute to the provision of certain universal services; - rules and regulations relating to net neutrality, subscriber privacy, end-user protection and data protection; - rules and regulations governing network integrity and security, continuity and lawful interception; ----- - rules and regulations relating to our networks, including imposed universal access obligations, coinstallation and co-location obligations (including submarine cable landing stations), right of way and ownership considerations; - rules governing the copyright royalties; - requirements on number portability; and - other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, environmental standards, city planning rules and customer service and consumer protection requirements. Furthermore, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dutch government has prescribed detailed guidelines to maintain social distancing and hygiene measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our customer and employee premises. If additional or more stringent measures were to be imposed in the future, will increase, the burden on management of such premises and could also lead to findings of material breaches and related enforcement action for failures to comply with such requirements, which could adversely affect our operating results and, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition and prospects. Some of the regulations applicable to our operations within the EU often derive from EU directives. The various directives require Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover such issues as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our business in the relevant jurisdictions is regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In The Netherlands, the ACM is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Dutch Telecommunications Act and the Dutch Competition Act. The AT is part of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy and has enforcing powers in the fields of spectrum licenses, security and continuity on behalf of the Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, as described in the Dutch Telecommunications Act. The Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (“AFM”) (Autoriteit Financiële _Markten) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Dutch Financial Supervision Act._ The Privacy Authority (“AP”) (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) is the data protection authority for The Netherlands and the supervisory authority for the processing of personal data. The Dutch Media Authority (Commissariaat voor de Media) has powers in relation to the Dutch Media Act. The Netherlands National Cyber Security Center (Nationaal Cyber Security Centrum) is competent, on a standalone basis or alongside AT, on cyber security incidents.

Moreover, the regulation introduces measures relating to “net neutrality.” Furthermore, the roaming regulation was completed by other pieces of legislation: - Implementing Regulation EU 2016/2286 of 15/12/2016 laying down detailed rules on the application of fair use policy and on the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming provider for the purposes of that assessment; and ----- - Regulation EU 2017/920 of 17/05/2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 with respect to rules for wholesale roaming markets. The European Commission’s proposals on telecommunications markets presented in September 2016 in-tends to fix rules to support the creation of Gigabit Society. The electronic communications code proposal aims to make investment in very high capacity networks a binding objective and it also aims to promote sustainable long term competition. It was adopted through Directive 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (the “EECC”), which entered into force on December 20, 2018. This legislation is expected to have both a positive and adverse effect on revenue generated from the Group’s operations due to anticipated price decreases, higher operational costs and increased competition. All of these factors may adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The EECC brings together the rules on electronic communications net-works and services and aligns them with the latest technological developments. The EECC regulates (i) electronic communications networks and services (“ECN” and “ECS”), (ii) associated facilities and services, (iii) the authorization of networks and services, (iv) radio spectrum use and numbering resources, (v) access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and (vi) the protection of end-users. It aims to: - promote connectivity, access to and take-up of very high capacity networks by all citizens and businesses of the EU; - promote competition in the provision of electronic communication networks and services; - contribute to the development of the internal market in the field of electronic communications networks and services, radio spectrum, and connectivity; and - promote the interests of European citizens. The EECC has singled out citizen connectivity as a key objective for the EU, since it is instrumental in guaranteeing freedom of expression, pluralism, democracy, culture, social cohesion, and even safety. The EECC also adopts a broader definition of ECS to regulate OTT services. ECS now includes internet access services, interpersonal communications services (“ICS”), and services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. The EECC also provides for strategic planning and coordination of a radio spectrum policy, as well as for effective management of radio spectrum by Member States. Finally, national regulatory authorities are responsible for ensuring access, interconnection, and the interoperability of services. Consequently, and under certain circumstances, they can impose on undertakings obligations such as interconnecting networks, ensuring the interoperability of their services and granting physical access to their infrastructure. Member States were required to enact the EECC into their national laws by December 21, 2020. In The Netherlands, the implementation of the EECC is still ongoing. Three EECC elements were implemented with priority in 2020: symmetrical access regulation, reduction of barriers to provider switching, and certain government investigatory powers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

To the extent that we are deemed by relevant authorities to exhibit significant market power, we can be subject to various regulatory obligations adversely affecting our results of operations and profitability. Regulatory authorities may also require us to grant third parties access to our network, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end-customers, particularly if they were to find that we hold a position of market dominance.

From time to time, we may also become involved in litigation matters pending against or related to entities that we acquire. Some of the proceedings against us may involve claims for considerable amounts and may require that our general management devote time to address the issues raised to the detriment of managing the business. In addition, such proceedings may result in substantial damages or fines and/or may impair our reputation. For example, in September 2019, the ACM fined several Dutch telecommunications companies for allegedly providing incorrect and unclear information to consumers about their offers on their websites. In particular, both T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 received penalties for not fulfilling information obligations on their websites in the period from October 2018 to March 2019. We are appealing a February 2021 decision by the District Court of Rotterdam relating to the amount of these fines, with a hearing expected in the first half of 2022. As of that February 2021 court ruling, which reduced the amount of the original fine by €1.3 million, we still face two fines in this matter in the total amount of approximately €5.3 million. Any future such negative legal or regulatory outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. We may also be exposed to proceedings with our independent distributor partners, as well as other telecommunications operators. Additionally, we are currently being investigated by the AT, in joint cooperation with the AP, regarding alleged breaches of data protection and telecommunications laws in connection with our sharing certain aggregated and anonymized customer location data with CBS under a partnership with CBS that has since terminated. If it finds against us, the AT could impose a fine of up to €900,000. Although the AP is coordinating with the AT in this matter and is unlikely to impose additional fines, the AP has the power to impose fines in addition to fines imposed by the AT. Prior to changing our debt collection processes and agencies in the first quarter of 2020, we sold customer invoice receivables to Direct Pay who, as of September 30, 2021, continues to owe us €4.3 million under our agreement with them, which we have currently provisioned as bad debt. However, Direct Pay has submitted claims to us in the aggregate amount of €7.5 million, first, that we have not provided sufficient documentation regarding customer contracts and invoices, and second, that it lost profits due to unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment that diminished its ability to collect on the debts, and that we should share the burden of such alleged lost profits. We discussed the matter with Direct Pay in the course of the third quarter of 2021 but have been unable to resolve the dispute amicably thus far. We or Direct Pay may initiate legal proceedings if we are not able to resolve this matter. Any such litigation may have material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, we have been involved in litigation involving our prior and discontinued offer of “free handsets” to consumers along with mobile subscriptions, referred to as “all-in subscriptions.” In 2014 and 2016, the Supreme Court of The Netherlands gave interlocutory decisions in which it concluded that such offerings were not compliant with statutory provisions on installment purchases, credit transactions and credit agreements. We had voluntarily stopped offering such all-in subscriptions on September 9, 2014 for direct sales and January 18, 2015 for indirect sales. Tele2, which we subsequently acquired, also offered all-in subscriptions and stopped offering them on September 1, 2014. Subsequently, multiple claims vehicles and foundations have solicited individuals to initiate mass claims against telecommunications providers who offered all-in subscriptions. We have been in contact with several vehicles and foundations in order to reach a settlement and have reached a settlement with Consumentenbond and ConsumentenClaim in October 2020 in particular regarding the period and type of mobile subscription eligible for compensation as well as the calculation method for the amount of compensation per customer. We have finalized processing claims under this settlement. However, this settlement does not cover claims submitted by other claims vehicles and foundations. For instance, we are in settlement discussions with MobiClaim B.V. (“MobiClaim”) in particular regarding potential claims on the same matter from claimants who are not party to any settlements thus far, and Stichting Consument & Telecomsector (“Contel”) approached us in mid-2021 to express a willingness to pursue certain claims that have been pending since 2016. Such negotiations may fail and it is possible that MobiClaim or ----- ConTel will initiate legal proceedings. Although we expect our provision to be adequate for all potential claims regarding this matter, and Deutsche Telekom and Tele2 Sweden severally have indemnified us with respect to claims against us arising under this matter, subject to certain limitations and conditions, there can be no guarantee that we can effectively enforce any such indemnities and any such action may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations. For additional information on this matter, see “Business—Legal Proceedings.” We regularly perform a risk assessment in respect of each open claim, litigation and proceeding and, as of September 30, 2021, we had made a provision in our financial statements based on the estimated level of risk and the expected outcome of the proceedings. However, we cannot assure you that the costs associated with any of the proceedings we are involved in will not exceed the amounts reserved for them, and cash or non-cash charges to earnings may result in the event that these matters are unfavorably resolved.

Such value has been determined in compliance with the applicable accounting rules. The registration is supported by, among others, our estimates of future taxable income. Should our future results materially deviate from such estimates, accounting rules will require us to register an impairment of such tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. Our ability to apply the resulting tax losses and/or tax credits is conditional upon sufficient profit being generated in the coming financial years.

We may learn of additional information about the Target that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we could become liable for overdue payables of the Target Group to suppliers and employees that are not currently known to us, or we could become subject to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of which we underestimated. In conducting our due diligence, we have been required to rely on resources available to us, including public information and information provided by the Existing Shareholders and third-party advisers. In addition, our due diligence provided for materiality thresholds, a limited scope and a restricted perimeter. There can be no assurance that the due diligence we have undertaken has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating the Acquisition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during the due diligence exercise. The due diligence process is inherently subjective. If the due diligence investigation failed to identify material information regarding the Target Group, we may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan or incur impairment or other charges. Similarly, the materialization of certain risks, which may or may not have been identified during due diligence, may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and, potentially, subsequent contractual and statutory liability to various parties. Any of these events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Relating to the Acquisition,13.4.6,We have made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition in forecasts that may prove to be materially inaccurate.,"We have made certain assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings, synergies and associated costs of the Acquisition. These assumptions are based on information made available by the Target Group, which we believe to be reasonable. However, these assumptions and forecasts may prove to be inaccurate, and we may suffer from, among others, a failure to realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition, higher than expected transaction and integration costs, costs related to unknown liabilities, and a deterioration of our business due to general economic and business conditions. Specifically, the Company’s objective to realize cost savings described under “Summary—Our Strategies,” “Summary Financial Information and Other _Financial Data—Other Financial Information” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum may differ_ materially from our actual results and investors should not place undue reliance on this objective. We have not defined, and do not intend to define, “short-term” or “medium-term,” and these should not be read as indicating that we are targeting such cost savings for any particular fiscal year. This cost-savings objective is based on a number of assumptions which are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and other risks, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, such assumptions may change or may not materialize at all. In addition, unanticipated events may adversely affect our actual results in future periods whether or not these assumptions otherwise prove to be correct. As a result, our actual cost savings, if any, may vary materially from this objective. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the Acquisition and could cause our actual results to differ from the assumptions and forecasts set forth in this Offering Memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

We cannot exclude the possibility that some of these third parties may exercise their ----- termination, adjustment or other rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position following the Acquisition. In addition, some of the third parties may use their termination or adjustment rights to renegotiate the terms of the agreements to our detriment and may benefit from stronger bargaining power, as a result of which the Target Group may only be able to secure replacement contracts on less favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, the Acquisition itself has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from management, which could adversely affect management’s ability to operate the business.

See “Principal _Shareholders” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” The Sponsors have, directly or_ indirectly, the power to affect, among others, our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our operations. In addition, the Sponsors control decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether our management believes that any such transactions are in our own best interests. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Indentures, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional or more expensive indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect us. In addition, for compliance with certain restrictive covenants, we will depend upon the cooperation of our principal shareholders, who have the power to effect compliance with such covenants. The interests of the Sponsors and their affiliates could conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The Sponsors may also have an interest in pursuing divestitures, financings or other transactions that in their judgment could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to holders of the Notes. In addition, the Sponsors or their affiliates may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours or do business with us. The Sponsors may also pursue through different portfolio companies acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors collectively continue to own a significant amount of our capital stock, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

The Issuers have no have material business operations or own assets other than, following the Completion Date, the ownership interest it holds in the Target and with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer its rights and claims under the Proceeds Loan Agreements. The Senior Notes Issuer will be dependent upon payments under the Senior Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement and cash flow from our operating companies to meet its obligations under the Senior Notes. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be dependent upon cash flow for the Target’s operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. We intend to provide funds to the Issuers in order for the Issuers to meet their obligations under the Notes principally through payments made pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreements, the provisions of intercompany loans, dividends and other distributions. If entities within our Group do not fulfill their obligations under any such intercompany loans and do not otherwise distribute cash in order for the Issuers (as applicable) to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuers will not have any other source of funds that would allow them to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The ----- #### amount of cash available to the Issuers will depend on the profitability and cash flows of the Target Group’s operating companies and the ability of those companies to transfer funds under applicable law. Our operating companies, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance loans, directly or indirectly, to the Issuers in order for the Issuers to make payments in respect of the Notes. In addition, the entities of the Target Group that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of the Target’s subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. The inability to transfer cash among entities within the consolidated Group may mean that even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet the obligations under the Notes, they may not be permitted to make the necessary dividends or distributions from one entity in the Restricted Group to another entity in the Restricted Group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations. Despite the covenants in the Indentures, and the Senior Facilities Agreement limiting the ability of the Parent’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Assuming the Completion Date occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any case no later than 150 days after the Completion Date, the Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and the Additional Senior Notes Guarantors will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes, respectively. However, not all members of the Group will guarantee the Notes, and, under various circumstances, the Guarantees may be released and newly incorporated direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent may not be required to guarantee the Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.” Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts due #### under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under our finance facilities and bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. As of September 30, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the subsidiaries that are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have had no third party financial debt outstanding. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, #### reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuers (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors #### (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement will permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indentures or the Senior Facilities Agreement, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

As of September 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €3,750 million, including €1,350 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, €2,400 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Facilities and excluding €500 million available for drawing under the RCF1, €200 million available for drawing under the RCF2 and €17.7 million in relation to non-recourse factoring facilities. We anticipate that we will continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.”_ Furthermore, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. Increases in our total indebtedness could also lead to a downgrade of the ratings assigned to the Group or the Notes, which could negatively affect their trading price. Our current or future leverage could prevent us from generating sufficient cash to pay the principal, interest or any other amounts that become due and payable under our indebtedness, including the Notes. The terms of the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement will permit the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, including the Group’s operating companies and the proceeds from such indebtedness may be used, among others, to finance shareholder dividends or other distributions to shareholders reducing our liquidity while increasing our leverage. Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations including, but not limited to: - result in our inability to maintain one or more of the financial ratios under our debt agreements, which could trigger the early maturity of part or all our debt; - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with lower leverage and better access to third-party financing sources; - increase the costs of current and future loans; - limit our capacity to access new debt and promote necessary investment, or our ability to withstand adverse market conditions, including an economic downturn due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; or - force us to increase our capital stock or to divest specific strategic assets to service our debts or comply with the commitments under such debts. Most of the principal amount of our financial debt falls due in 2028, as upon the maturity of the TLB and the repayment of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and there can be no assurance that we will at such time be able to refinance or otherwise repay such principal amount in full. Similarly, the Senior Notes will mature in 2029, which is one year after the maturity of the Senior Secured Notes and the TLB, and therefore holders of the Senior Notes are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to raise the financing that we require to refinance the Senior Secured Notes and/or the TLB, which mature prior to the Senior Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

These agreements limit our ability to, among others: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase its capital stock; ----- - make certain restricted payments; - make certain investments; - create or permit to exist certain liens; - impose restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company; - merge or consolidate with other entities, or make certain asset sales; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and - guarantee certain indebtedness. All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications which could allow us to among other things, make significant distributions to our shareholders, incur substantial amounts of debt, make significant investments and make asset sales. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain _Covenants” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject_ under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement could limit our ability to operate our business, to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while the TLB and the RCF remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Senior Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the RCF. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities _Agreement—Financial covenant.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the RCF may be affected by_ events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Facilities Agreement could, subject to the applicable cure period, result in an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the relevant creditors are entitled to cancel the availability of their commitments and/or elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, certain defaults, events of default and/or acceleration actions under the Senior Facilities Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all our other liabilities that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to redeem the Notes.

See “Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.” An increase in the interest rates on our debt_ will reduce the funds available to repay our debt and to finance our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. Historically, we have entered into various hedging instruments to manage exposure to movements in interest rates, in particular interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, executed to partially hedge our floating rate interest obligations. However, there can be no assurance that such financial hedging instruments will be sufficient to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Additionally, there can be no guarantee that any hedging strategies will adequately protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuation, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. In addition, derivatives transactions in connection with any hedging strategy may result in significant costs and could expose us to significant liabilities in the future. ----- As a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease to be published as panel bank rates or become unrepresentative after June 30, 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings for all currencies (including 1 week and 2 month U.S. dollar LIBOR) will cease as panel bank rates after December 31, 2021). It is not known if or when regulatory reform may, in the future, cause EURIBOR to cease or be replaced. The U.S. dollar floating rate market is currently expected to transition to use, in place of U.S. dollar LIBOR, replacement rates including a floating rate equal to compounding overnight SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve in the US) plus a spread adjustment, as well as alternative rates to compounding overnight SOFR, by not later than the time that the relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR setting is to cease as a panel bank rate. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any of our debt linked to such a benchmark, whether or not under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Regulatory requirements under the EU Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to EURIBOR) and under the UK Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to LIBOR) may: (i) discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a regulated benchmark (such as EURIBOR or LIBOR); (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used for the benchmark or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. The scheduled cessation of the LIBOR benchmark as a panel bank rate or any proposal to cease the determination or publication of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which the relevant benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any affected benchmark, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to that benchmark and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and therefore have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

See note 2.4 to the 2019 Financial Statements. We have adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective method. On the transition to IFRS 16, remaining payment obligations from existing operating leases were discounted using the relevant incremental borrowing rate and recognized as a lease liability and the right-to-use assets were carried as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture regulates the ability of the relevant Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—The Senior Secured Notes Collateral” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Security—The Shared Collateral.” There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuers to satisfy their respective obligations under the Notes. There is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuers or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustees or holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Collateral. The security interests of the Security Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, which may include regulatory authorities, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets, including due to any applicable regulatory constraints. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. In addition, the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, may have difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition with third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in, and/or priority with respect to, the same Collateral.

The Instructing Group is entitled to give instructions to take enforcement action prior to the end of the applicable consultation period without consulting with any creditor representative or hedge counterparty if Collateral has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event that has occurred with respect to any relevant Group company, or the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith that to enter into such consultation and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the Collateral would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce Collateral, or on the realization proceeds of any enforcement of Collateral, and in such circumstances any instructions are required to be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent is required to act in accordance with the instructions first received. The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions that may in its discretion require for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions until it has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as the case may be, the voting interest of holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as the case may be, in the Instructing Group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. The lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement or the creditors of other indebtedness that is pari passu with either the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as the case may be, and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the ----- holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” “Description of _the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.” Delays in enforcement could decrease or_ eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuers and the Guarantors in the event of a default.

However, the Indentures provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations _on Notes Guarantees and Security.” Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject_ to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Guarantees. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee; ----- - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee, (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or improper corporate distribution on other grounds, or that a court would not otherwise set aside such Guarantee. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court were to decide that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the relevant Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which remains valid and enforceable. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to such Issuers and the Guarantors would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, the laws of The Netherlands. Dutch insolvency laws are not identical to, and insolvency outcomes may vary from, the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings or whether Dutch insolvency laws would be favorable to your interests. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any future guarantors, if any, were to experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction’s or jurisdictions’ insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to_ offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuers to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Indentures, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Facilities Agreement or our other thenexisting contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Facilities Agreement. The exercise of the right of holders of the Notes to require the repurchase of the Notes upon a change of control could cause a default under our debt documents, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuers to receive cash from entities of our Group to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuers for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain third-party financing to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition or make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. Any failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indentures, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior _Notes—Change of Control.”_ Further, if pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes (as the case may be) validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indentures will permit the relevant Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes (as the case may be) at a price of 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected. The change of control provisions contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior _Notes—Change of Control,” as the case may be). Except as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control,” the Indentures do not_ contain provisions that would require the Issuers to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. Additionally, there are certain exceptions to the definition of “Change of Control” which allow changes in the ownership of the relevant Issuer if certain conditions are satisfied, including if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such Change of Control on one occasion. In the event the Parent is sold to a new investor, whether or not such sale constitutes a change of control under the Indentures, no assurance can be given that any such investor will continue to implement our current business and financial strategy. The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indentures include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the ----- Parent’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering Memorandum is derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Financial Statements”). The audited consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were originally approved by us on December 31, 2019. Thereafter, we have restated certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in the 2019 Financial Statements, by restating the classification of “other receivables” to “trade receivables” for an amount of €619 thousand, “other payables” to “current other liabilities” for an amount of €68,947 thousand, “non-current other liabilities” to “other liabilities” for an amount of €2,004 thousand, “other receivables” to “other assets” for an amount of €32,629 thousand and “tax liabilities” to “liabilities held for sale” for an amount of €1,792 thousand. These restatements do not have any impact on the reported profit for the year 2018 or reported equity and an immaterial impact on the cash flow statement for 2018. As a result, we have not separately restated the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. See note 2.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements. In addition, we also present certain financial information of the Target Group for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 (the “LTM Financial Information”). Except as otherwise stated, the LTM Financial Information is derived by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the audited consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income of the Target Group for the year ended December 31, 2020 and deducting the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income of the Target Group for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The LTM Financial Information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. Except as stated otherwise, the LTM Financial Information is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting or in accordance with IFRS. We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) effective from January 1, 2019. As a result, leases (as lessee) that would have been classified in previous periods as operating leases are recognized in our consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019. Under the new standard, except for short-term or low-value leases, the right to use a leased asset is recognized as an asset with a corresponding financial liability for the present value of outstanding lease payments. Assets with a finite useful life are subject to impairment testing. We have adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective method. On the transition to IFRS 16, remaining payment ----- obligations from existing operating leases were discounted using the relevant incremental borrowing rate and recognized as a lease liability and the right-to-use assets were carried as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments.

See “Presentation _of Financial and Other Information.”_ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and international accounting standards, as applicable, requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements are disclosed in the Historical Consolidated Financial Statements, as indicated below in “—Significant Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements used when Applying _Accounting Principles.”_ The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering Memorandum is derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Financial Statements”).

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.5.1,Mobile and Fixed Subscriber Base,"Mobile subscribers consist of subscribers for voice services (including incoming and outgoing calls), SMS and MMS services, and mobile broadband services (smartphones, wireless internet access through a laptop, tablet, wireless router or dongle). Fixed subscribers consist of subscribers for FTTH or xDSL broadband services through one of our fixed line services, TV or telephony packages, as well as other business and Wholesale Services such as “fiber to the office” services. The evolution of our mobile and fixed subscriber bases is, and in the periods under review was, driven by market dynamics (including regulatory environment, competition-driven price evolution, demographics, technological innovation and changing customer behavior), our ability to capture new subscribers and retain existing subscribers, our acquisitions, and macroeconomic conditions. See “—Macroeconomic Developments and the Impact of COVID-19 in The Netherlands” and “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our business is concentrated in The Netherlands, and may be adversely affected by negative economic, legal or political developments in The Netherlands.” A larger_ subscriber base generally results in higher revenue, as the number of our revenue-generating customers increases. In addition, as a substantial portion of our costs are fixed, a larger subscriber base produces certain relative cost savings, as efficiencies of scale in our network reduce the costs per customer of delivering our services and providing customer support. With the acquisition of Tele2 in January 2019 and Simpel in December 2020, we have substantially increased our subscriber base by covering all consumer segments of the B2C postpaid market, particularly by offering the full range of premium to low budget products, which we believe strengthened our position as the largest mobile telecommunications provider in the Dutch consumer market by mobile service revenue and number of SIMs. We divide our mobile subscriber base primarily into postpaid and prepaid B2C mobile and postpaid B2B mobile. In particular, we expect the Dutch B2C mobile postpaid market, which is a key segment of growth for us, to expand due to growth in postpaid SIMs, driven by prepaid to postpaid migration, increasing use of second SIMs, population growth and an increased prevalence of younger generations using mobiles phones at an early age. Similarly, we expect our B2B mobile market to grow across the three main segments: SOHO/VSE, SMB and LE/CE. Postpaid SIMs are counted in our subscriber base as long as they have an active contract and prepaid SIMs are counted in our subscriber base as long as a SIM card is connected to our network which has had at least one chargeable event or incoming traffic event (excluding any traffic initiated by us) within the last six months. The calculation includes subscribers through wholesale resellers, as we enter into direct contractual arrangements with customers of resellers, but excludes subscribers through MVNOs, as MVNOs own their respective subscriber bases. Each connection by a subscriber represents at least one line; however, this may vary depending on circumstances, and one subscriber may have several lines (for instance, a broadband line, together with two postpaid lines). We expect our fixed subscriber base to grow due to a household growth, further FTTH penetration in The Netherlands and better quality. In this regard, in April 2021, we announced a strategic partnership with Open Dutch Fiber, a company owned by KKR and DTCP, to roll-out fiber services to over one million homes passed. We are the anchor tenant on the network, which focuses on dense, urban areas in which we currently have a large mobile market share. The following chart presents a breakdown of our mobile and fixed line subscribers in our consumer and business segments as of December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and as of September 30, 2020 and 2021, presented on a historical pro forma basis to include the pro forma effect of the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel:",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Approximately 94% of Dutch households have fixed broadband and 128% of the Dutch population have mobile broadband in 2020 (Source: Digital Economy and Society Index _(DESI) 2020, European Commission), we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from growth in both the_ mobile and fixed broadband sectors, driven by increasing subscription rates. The Netherlands has the lowest mobile-only access rate at less than 0.04% of European households, which correlates with the fact that it has the highest take-up rate of fixed broadband in the European Union. We believe that due to our vast product offering we are able to respond to fixed broadband and to mobile-only customers. With a mobile coverage per population of over 99% for 4G and of approximately 92% for 5G, we are able to provide our clients with strong coverage based on an extensive network footprint and the highest density site grids in urban areas.

Our main competitors offer integrated products over their fixed line and/or cable networks, including fixed-mobile services bundles comprising mobile, fixed voice and broadband internet products, as well as 4P bundles that combine these three products with television services. Bundled services are expected to remain important and customers that have such services are less likely to switch to a different operator for all or part of the bundled services. We have used and will continue to use bundled offerings and value added services to attract new customers, and to migrate existing customers to additional services, by cross-selling broadband to our existing mobile subscriber base and upselling higher value packages. During the periods under review we have focused our efforts on cross-selling FMC services and second and third lines to postpaid subscribers, providing discounts to postpaid mobile and fixed subscribers if they sign up for a bundled offering including FMC services and multiple mobile lines. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Cignal Infrastructure was thereafter transferred to Deutsche Telekom on January 1, 2019, and ceased to form part of our consolidated financial results from that date, with TMNL continuing to have full access to the contributed infrastructure through a long-term, arms-length service agreement. In June 2021, Deutsche Telekom sold Cignal Infrastructure to Digital Infrastructure Vehicle 1 SCSP a joint venture of Cellnex and DTCP, and subsequently it was transferred to Cellnex Netherlands B.V. Currently, we benefit from access to 3,150 towers owned by Cignal Infrastructure with nationwide coverage under a long term contract for an initial term of 15 years, with the option for T-Mobile Netherlands to renew for two additional periods of 10 years each, and at favorable terms consisting of a capped yearly cost increase in line with the Consumer Price Index. _Acquisition of Tele2 and Simpel_ In January 2019, we completed the acquisition of Tele2. The acquisition has strengthened our position in the Dutch telecommunications market, particularly in the premium mobile segment, allowing us to compete more effectively with our competitors in the Dutch market, due to enhanced scale, combined spectrum resources and significant synergy potential. Pursuant to this acquisition, we acquired approximately 1.2 million subscribers, as of January 2, 2019. On December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, the largest MVNO in The Netherlands. This has helped to further consolidate our leading position in the mobile market and expand into a low budget segment of the Dutch mobile market. Pursuant to this acquisition, we acquired approximately 1.0 million subscribers, who at the time of the acquisition already used our network pursuant to a network access arrangement that Simpel had previously entered into with us. We are executing a three-year plan to realize synergies from our acquisition of Tele2 in 2019. We have closed Tele2’s standalone stores and we are in the process of implementing significant operations costs savings. Based on our estimates, we anticipate realizing total cost-saving synergies in connection with Tele2 and Simpel with a total run-rate synergy potential of €139 million by 2024, having already realized €116 million of synergies run-rate as of September 30, 2021. Synergies related to Tele2 and Simpel include reduced interconnect costs, migration of Tele2’s BSS to our Magenta stack, synergies in respect of bad debt collections (representing improved client acceptance and collection practices implemented upon integration with TMNL), direct and indirect cost savings related to the discontinuance of the Tele2 network and the cancellation of leased telecommunications towers, reduction in marketing expenses as a result of mobile cross-selling, optimization of campaigning periods, reduction in other indirect costs such as personnel related costs as well as legal audit and tax fees.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

These frequencies are auctioned by the Dutch government and are generally valid for 15 to 20 years, after which the licenses are put up for auction again. The first 5G frequencies were auctioned in mid-2020 and we were able to acquire bands on the 700 MHz and 1,400 MHz frequencies for the first time as well as re-acquire our previouslyowned 2,100 MHz spectrum. As of December 31, 2020, we had the largest mobile spectrum portfolio in The Netherlands, ranging from low frequency (700 MHz) to high frequency (2,600 MHz), with no reinvestment required until 2030. We intend to participate in the new 3.5 GHz spectrum auction, which is currently expected in the second half of 2022. Our business capital expenditure primarily consists of Mobile Capital Expenditure (which represents capital expenditure relating to expansion and/or improvement of our mobile network infrastructure and is calculated as the sum of capital expenditure relating to (i) modernization of RAN to ensure full 5G capabilities ----- and the roll-out of low frequency 5G-ready bands and (ii) other expansion or improvement of our mobile network, such as in relation to quality improvement and network evolution projects and capital expenditure to increase capacity), Fixed Capital Expenditure (which represents capital expenditure necessary to maintain and expand our fixed infrastructure, and is primarily related to (i) capacity extension and upgrades of our fixed infrastructure, (ii) investments in active equipment in new roll-out areas, (iii) customer-premise equipment for new customers and (iv) quality improvements and phase out of legacy networks). IT Capital Expenditure (which represents capital expenditure relating to the ongoing IT transformation and our cloud-first strategy) and Other Capital Expenditure (which represents certain other heads of capital expenditures incurred by us, such as in relation to the acquisition and post-acquisition integration related capital expenditure as well as certain other miscellaneous heads of capital expenditure such as in relation building facilities and retail outlets). During the last three financial years, we have spent in the aggregate €337.4 million as Mobile Capital Expenditure (€79.7 million in 2018, €143.0 million in 2019, €114.7 million in 2020). We spent in the aggregate €166.4 million as Fixed Capital Expenditure (€22.3 million in 2018, €64.5 million in 2019, €79.6 million in 2020). In addition, we spent in the aggregate €124.9 million as IT Capital Expenditure (€41.6 million in 2018, €44.6 million in 2019 and €38.7 million in 2020) and in the aggregate €78.1 million as Other Capital Expenditure (€2.7 million in 2018, €38.8 million in 2019 and €36.6 million in 2020). See also “—Liquidity and Capital Resources— _Capital Expenditure” and “Summary—Summary Financial Information and Other Data—Capital Expenditure Data.”_ In particular, in addition to other factors such as the impact of adoption of IFRS 16, our business capital expenditure has resulted in an increase in our fixed assets.

In particular, though our B2C mobile postpaid segment ARPU decreased from €16.2 in 2018 to €15.5 in 2020, it has remained relatively steady in more recent periods, at €15.7 in 2019, €15.5 in 2020 and €15.6 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Factors such as 5G monetization, growth of unlimited offerings, low-end rationalization initiatives, growth of valueadded services and FMC growth, are expected to keep our B2C mobile ARPU steady in the short term and also potentially support its growth over time. Our B2C fixed segment ARPU has remained stable (€33.4 in 2018, €33.5 in 2020 and €33.4 during the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, in each case on a historical pro forma basis for the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel). We intend to grow our B2C fixed segment ARPU, in particular in respect of our T-Mobile Thuis brand, by implementing a strategic shift to premium value fixed portfolio over ----- time. Similarly, though our B2B mobile segment ARPU decreased from €17.2 in 2018 to €13.7 in 2020 (on a historical pro forma basis for the acquisitions of Tele2 and Simpel), our B2B mobile segment ARPU has experienced similar stabilizing trend in more recent periods and we expect it to grow over time. The decline of ARPU in the segment can mostly be attributed to faster growth in the LE/CE segment compared to growth in smaller sized segments. Within the B2B mobile segment, ARPU in the SOHO/VSE market segment has grown recently, driven by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services and value-added services, and we believe these drivers will continue to have a positive impact on ARPU growth in our B2B segment generally. In addition, historically, the B2B mobile and in particular the SOHO/VSE segments were negatively impacted by ARPU declines driven by significant one-off effects, such as the impact of IFRS-15 and decline in roaming usage due to travel restrictions following the COVID-19 pandemic. Going forward, we do not expect these factors to negatively impact ARPUs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

To the extent they relate to and influence rates of consumer confidence and spending in The Netherlands, rates of Dutch unemployment, GDP growth and other macroeconomic metrics can impact the amount of money that Dutch consumers spend on our products and services and thus impact our sales and results of operations. GDP growth and other economic metrics may also correlate with rates of business investment in The Netherlands, and can thus impact our sales to business customers. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dutch GDP increased by 1.96% in 2019, continuing its process of gradual deceleration from the average GDP growth rate of 2.4% from 2016-2018, but still significantly higher than the average GDP growth rate of 1.1% during the period from 2013-2015. Additionally, the inflation rate was on average 2.6% in 2019, well above from 1.1% in 2016-2018 and from 1.4% in 20132015. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many countries, including The Netherlands, have taken preventative measures to try to contain its spread. These measures have included mandatory closure of businesses, social distancing requirements and travel restrictions, which have severely diminished the level of economic activity around the world and in The Netherlands, caused significant volatility ----- in financial markets and triggered a period of global economic slowdown, the extent and duration of which remain uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic and the multiple waves of infections that have been recorded have severely impacted the economies of the European Union, including The Netherlands. In particular, the World Bank registered a contraction for the European Union’s real GDP of 5.9% in 2020 and forecasts deeper continuing impacts on those economies dependent on international tourism as well as those dependent on international trade, as supply bottlenecks persist (Source: World Bank, Global Economic Prospects January _2021; June 2021). In The Netherlands, employment and working hours were negatively impacted, with the_ unemployment rate increasing by 1.9% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2020 and total working hours bottoming out at an aggregate loss of 7.7 average weekly hours in May of 2020 (Source: Institute of Labor _Economics, Drivers of Working Hours and Household Income Dynamics during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Case of The Netherlands). COVID-19 caseload waves and concomitant containment measures were associated_ with exceptional declines in consumer spending in two waves in 2020, reaching 17% and 12% declines in consumer spending year-over-year in April and December of 2020, respectively (Source: Statistics _Netherlands). Eurostat has registered a contraction of the Dutch economy of 3.7% in 2020 (source: Eurostat)._ However, due to a steady vaccination drive and the resulting stimulation in economic activity, consumption and public confidence, the OECD has projected a steady rebound of the Dutch economy in 2021, with a projected GDP growth of 3.5% in 2021. For 2022, the OECD has currently forecast a growth of 3.0%. The annual average unemployment rate is expected to be 4.12% in 2021 and 4.66% in 2022. (Source: OECD). In response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 16, 2020 we temporarily closed all of our retail shops, and thereafter, beginning March 21, 2020 and in compliance with regulations and guidance issued by the Dutch government, we gradually reopened some of our retail shops in a ‘box-in shop’ format, whereby our retail shops were installed with Plexiglas walls enabling our employees and consumers to safely interact with each other. In June 2020, we reopened the entirety of our retail shops while implementing social distancing measures. On December 15, 2020, the Dutch government ordered the closure of all non-essential commercial and retail businesses in The Netherlands and, in compliance with this directive, we closed all of our retail shops for sale while remaining open for service as it qualified as essential services. In April 2021, we progressively reopened our retail stores while requiring certain social distancing and other safety measures to be observed. In addition, the self-isolation measures imposed by the Dutch government in order to combat COVID19 have resulted in a considerable increase in internet traffic, as customers increasingly relied on VoIP and OTT services while gatherings are prohibited and residents are advised to stay at home. The COVID-19 pandemic positively impacted our B2B segment, as people worked remotely, leading to an increase in calls, data usage, video-conferencing and other services requested by business customers. However, COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on our roaming revenues due to travel restrictions imposed on our customers by many countries and territories around the world meant that mobile roaming remained limited during this period. Our networks continue to be stable and we believe are able to cope well with the additional volume caused by increased numbers of people working from home.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

We also undertook a material demerger of infrastructure assets during this period. The impact of these acquisitions as well as the demerger should be taken into account when comparing the Historical Consolidated Financial Statements across the periods included therein. These acquisitions and the demerger consist of the following, in chronological order: - on September 1, 2018, we completed the demerger of part of our passive equipment and part of our rented sites to a separate legal entity, Cignal Infrastructure (at demerger and until June 2021, T-Infra). Subsequently, Cignal Infrastructure was transferred to Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V. on January 1, 2019, and ceased to form part of our consolidated financial results from that date; ----- - on January, 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Tele2’s Dutch operations, and it has been consolidated into our financial results from that date; - on December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, and it has been consolidated into our financial results from that date. Following the Acquisition, our business operations will be separated from Deutsche Telekom and run as a stand-alone business. In this regard, and at the time of completion of the Acquisition, we expect to enter into certain transitional services agreements, including with Tele2. As a result of the separation, we do not expect our cost base to change materially. In addition, going forward our business would not avail of financing from the Deutsche Telekom, and we expect to fulfil our liquidity requirements mainly from net cash generated from operating activities, the Notes, drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement (including the RCF) and the factoring arrangements entered into by us from time to time.

Revenue in the first quarter is generally less compared to the following quarters in the financial year due to the fact that this quarter has one to two less days than the second and the fourth quarter. This only affects customers in pay-per-use voice tariffs. - _Third Quarter. Some revenue uplift is linked to the growth of out of bundle usage by postpaid mobile lines, due to customers leaving their regular residence and place of work where they have access to broadband and Wi-Fi, whereas they tend to have more limited access to Wi-Fi on vacation, increasing their data usage. This mostly affects customers having tariffs with a low data allowance and prepaid mobile lines.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Since expenses and cash outflows for leases are substantial elements of our earnings performance and solvency, we have taken into account the effects of IFRS 16 (Leases) when determining our financial performance indicators. On September 1, 2018, we demerged Cignal Infrastructure (at demerger and until June 2021, T-Infra), consisting primarily of passive infrastructure and site lease agreements, and subsequently transferred the entity as a dividend in kind to Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V. on January 1, 2019. After the demerger, we entered into a lease agreement with Cignal Infrastructure regarding the demerged passive infrastructure and sites. As of January 1, 2019, the passive equipment previously carried at cost and the right of use assets related to the greenfield and rooftop spaces, each of which were previously accounted as indirect costs, are now accounted as leases under IFRS 16. In order to ensure maximum comparability with our previous performance indicators, we measure our operational performance on the basis of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, which is calculated as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to exclude the impact of IFRS 16, thereby including operating lease expenses in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in order to arrive at a closer alignment with cash EBITDA.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Accordingly, revenue from Simpel was consolidated with our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (contributing €88.0 million), whereas our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 did not consolidate any revenue from Simpel. In addition, the increase in net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was, among other things, due to the increase in the subscriber base of our T-Mobile and Ben brands in our B2C mobile operations and our B2C fixed operations. Net revenue for our B2C segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €1,213.2 million, an increase of €136.3 million, or 12.7%, compared to €1,076.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of Simpel resulting in a larger customer base, an increase in ARPU for the B2C segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, and the increase in subscriber base in relation to our T-Mobile and Ben brands in our B2C mobile operations and our B2C fixed operations. Net revenue for our B2B segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €268.1 million, a decrease of €4.2 million, or 1.6%, compared to €263.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to growth in subscriber base in our B2B segment during these periods, partially offset by a decrease in the ARPU for the B2B segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (€13.0 per month, calculated on an historical basis) as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020 (€13.7 per month, calculated on an historical basis), driven by an increase in the mix of LE/CE customer segment, which has historically generated a relatively lower ARPU. Net revenue for our other segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €55.1 million, a decrease of €50.8 million, or 48.0%, compared to €106.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of Simpel. Prior to completion of this acquisition and during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Simpel was the largest MVNO in The Netherlands and we shared our network with Simpel against payment of network access fees, which were recorded as other income. Upon completion of the acquisition of Simpel, such network access arrangements were terminated and no network access fees from Simpel were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. _Other operating income_ Other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €0.4 million, a decrease of €2.6 million, or 86.7% compared to €3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to the fact that indemnification assets relating to “all-in subscriptions” contract claims was recognized during the nine months September 30, 2020 (€1.7 million). These claims relate to our prior and discontinued offer of ‘free handsets’ to consumers along with mobile subscriptions, referred to as ‘all-in subscriptions.’ In 2014 and 2016, the Supreme Court of The Netherlands ruled that such offerings were not compliant with statutory provisions on installment purchases, credit transactions and credit agreements. In this regard, multiple claims vehicles and foundations have solicited individuals to initiate mass claims against telecommunications providers who offered such all-in subscriptions, and as a result, we have recognized provisions in our financial statements for potential payout of these claims. Individual consumers were able to file their potential claim until September 1, 2019, and pursuant to an agreement reached by us in October 2020 with a joint venture organization, we have finalized processing claims from this organization as of date while others are still pending. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to ----- _Legislative and Regulatory Matters—We face risks arising from the outcome of various criminal, civil, administrative and regulatory proceedings.” Own capitalized costs_ Own capitalized costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were €15.7 million, an increase of €2.2 million, or 16.3%, compared to €13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to capitalization of increased workforce costs relating to internalization of certain technology management functions, which were previous carried out by an external vendor. _Goods and services purchased_ Goods and services purchased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were €851.1 million, an increase of €68.3 million, or 8.7%, compared to €782.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the costs of handset devices, which was primarily driven by an increase in the sales of handset devices and increase in the costs relating to fixed access services, which was primarily driven by an increase in our fixed subscriber base. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were €126.1 million, an increase of €2.6 million, or 2.1%, compared to €123.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in provisions for future payments under the share appreciation rights scheme instituted by us. _Net impairment losses on financial assets_ Net impairment losses on financial assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were €16.2 million, an increase of €6.1 million, or 60.4%, compared to €10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to release of bad debt provisions during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting from the clearance and reassessment of bad debt provision for accounts receivable balances of Tele2, upon migration of Tele2 systems to our systems and methodology. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were €16.2 million, a decrease of €5.7 million, or 26.0%, compared to €21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to lower legal and advisory expenses (€1.2) million and multiple individually smaller items within miscellaneous expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. _EBITDA_ EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €543.0 million, an increase of €18.0 million, or 3.4%, compared to €525.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to the increase in net revenues, driven by the acquisition of Simpel and an increase in our subscriber base, and partially offset by an increase in goods and services purchased, driven by an increase in the costs of handset devices and increases in costs relating to fixed access services. _Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_ Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were €362.4 million, an increase of €9.8 million, or 2.8% compared to €352.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in amortization and impairment of intangible assets (€3.1 million), and depreciation and impairment of PPE (€29.2 million), mainly driven by higher capital expenditure resulting in higher depreciation and impairment, partially offset by lower depreciation of leases (€22.4 million), mainly driven by a decrease in our lease base, including due to closure of the former Tele2 head office and dismantling of former Tele2’s mobile network sites, in each case during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 ----- _Profit from operations (EBIT)_ As a result of the factors described above, profit from operations (EBIT) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €180.6 million, an increase of €8.2 million, or 4.8%, compared to €172.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. _Net finance costs_ Interest income for nine months ended September 30, 2021 resulted in €2.5 million, a slight decrease of €0.3 million compared to €2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Interest expense for nine months ended September 30, 2021 resulted in €73.0 million, a slight increase of €0.5 million, or 0.7%, compared to a loss of €72.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. As a result of the movement in the interest income and interest expense as described above, net finance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €70.5 million, an increase of €0.8 million, or 1.1%, compared to €69.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. _Other financial (expense)/income_ Other financial (expense)/income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 represented an expense of €0.1 million compared to an income of €0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of €0.3 million due to changes in the measurement of provision for transactions in foreign currencies. _Gain/(loss) from other financial activities_ Gain/(loss) from other financial activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was a loss of €0.1 million, compared to a gain of €0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of €0.3 million due to certain changes in the measurement of provision for transactions in foreign currencies, which also resulted in an increase in other financial expenses as described above. _Net finance (expense)/income_ Net finance (expense)/income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was an expense of €70.6 million, compared to an expense of €69.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of €1.1 million, or 1.6%, due to an increase in net finance cost partially offset by an increase in other financial expenses, as described above. _Profit/(loss) before income taxes_ As a result of the factors described above, our profit before income taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, was €110.0 million, as compared to a profit before income tax of €103.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, representing an increase of €7.0 million, or 6.8%. _Income tax income/(expense)_ Income tax income/(expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was an expense of €27.6 million, compared to an expense of €16.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of €11.3 million, or 69.3%, primarily due to a tax refund of €7.8 million relating to tax filings for previous periods received from the Dutch tax authority during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, with no corresponding tax income during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. _Profit/(loss) for the period_ As a result of the factors described above, our profit/(loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €82.3 million, compared to €86.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of €4.4 million, or 5.1%. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

This increase was partially offset by completion of the Simpel acquisition on December 1, 2020, ----- pursuant to which, during the period from December 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, revenue from Simpel was recorded in the B2C segment and not in the other segment as network access fees. _Other operating income_ Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €29.5 million, an increase of €27.5 million compared to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily representing a gain in the fair value of the call options to acquire Simpel, pursuant to the improved outlook for Simpel post acquisition and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. _Own capitalized costs_ Own capitalized costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €18.1 million, an increase of €1.2 million, or 7.1%, compared to €16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to capitalization of workforce costs relating to certain functions at Tele2, which post Tele2 acquisition by the Target Group, were capitalized in accordance with the accounting policies of Tele2. _Goods and services purchased_ Goods and services purchased for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €1,076.2 million, a decrease of €33.2 million, or 3.0%, compared to €1,109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower cost relating to handset devices and lower cost of services purchased for acquiring and maintaining customers (such as marketing and sales costs and commission). _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €166.8 million, a decrease of €6.4 million, or 3.7%, compared to €173.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to reduction of salaries and wages driven by, in light of the Tele2 acquisition, rationalization and reduction of our employee base during the year ended December 31, 2019. _Net impairment losses on financial assets_ Net impairment losses on financial assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €16.8 million, a decrease of €6.5 million, or 27.8%, compared to €23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a change in debt collection policy as the Target Group began applying a “no cure, no pay” policy (i.e. prolonging the collection assessment timeframe on potential write-offs), beginning from the year ended December 31, 2020. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €29.5 million, a decrease of €13.2 million, or 30.9%, compared to €42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to reduced advisory and consultation costs, which were higher in the year ended December 31, 2019 in light of the Tele2 acquisition and movements in relation to the recognition of provisions relating to “all-in subscriptions” contract claims, partially offset by reduction in costs relating to factoring facilities. _EBITDA_ EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €706.7 million, an increase of €121.4 million, or 20.7%, compared to €585.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the increase in net revenues, driven by higher mobile service revenues and higher fixed services revenues, increase in operating income, driven by gain in the fair value of the call options to acquire Simpel and decrease in in goods and services purchased, driven by lower cost relating to handset devices and certain services purchased. ----- _Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_ Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €475.3 million, a decrease of €42.8 million, or 8.3%, compared to €518.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower depreciation of fixed assets of Tele2 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. _Profit from operations (EBIT)_ As a result of the factors described above, our profit from operations (EBIT) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €231.4 million, an increase of €164.3 million compared to €67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Net finance costs_ Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 was flat at €3.8 million. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €99.0 million, an increase of €1.4 million, or 1.4%, compared to a €97.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to increase in our debt obligations, primarily driven by the increased borrowing under the Existing Target Group 2020 Facility to finance the Simpel acquisition. As a result of the movement in the interest income and interest expense as described above, net finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €95.2 million, an increase of €1.4 million, or 1.5%, compared to €93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Other financial (expense)/income_ Other financial (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented an income of €0.2 million, compared to an expense of €0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to changes in the measurement of provision for transactions in foreign currencies. _Gain/(loss) from other financial activities_ Gain/(loss) from other financial activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a gain of €0.2 million compared to a loss of €0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to certain changes in the measurement of provision for transactions in foreign currencies, which also resulted in an increase in other financial expenses as described above. _Net finance (expense)/income_ Net finance (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an expense of €95.0 million, compared to an expense of €94.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €0.9 million, or 1.0%, due to an increase in net finance cost partially offset by a decrease in other financial expenses, as described above. _Gain/(loss)before income taxes_ As a result of the factors described above, gain/(loss)before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020, was a gain of €136.4 million, as compared to a loss of €27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of €163.4 million. _Income taxes_ Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 were a benefit of €38.4 million, compared to a benefit of €22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €16.1 million, due to a lower effective tax rate. Primarily, as a result of losses which previously were not recognized, prior year income tax ----- benefits and the positive tax effect of changes in tax rate during the year ended December 31 2020, we recognized a lower effective tax rate during this period as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, when the positive tax effect of changes in tax rate was partially offset by certain non-deductible expenses. _Profit/(loss) for the period_ As a result of the above factors, profit/(loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €174.8 million, compared to a loss of €4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €179.5 million.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Accordingly, revenue from Tele2 was consolidated with our results for the year ended December 31, 2019 (contributing €597.0 million), whereas our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 did not consolidate revenue from Tele2. In addition, the increase in net revenue for year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was, among other things, due to the increase in our subscriber base in relation to our T-Mobile and Ben brands in our B2C mobile operations and T-Mobile Thuis brand in our B2C fixed operations, partially offset by a slight decrease in our B2C Mobile postpaid ARPU during the same period (from €17.6 per month during the year ended December 31, 2018 to €17.2 per month during the year ended December 31, 2019, in each case calculated on an historical basis and excluding the impact of the Tele2 B2C Mobile postpaid ARPU). Net revenue for our B2C segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €1,426.0 million, an increase of €477.9 million, or 50.4%, compared to €948.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Tele2 resulting in a larger customer base (an addition of approximately 1.2 million subscribers, as of January 2, 2019 and a revenue of €336.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019) and the increase in subscriber base in relation to our T-Mobile and Ben brands in our B2C ----- mobile operations and T-Mobile Thuis brand in our B2C fixed operations, partially offset by a slight decrease in our B2C mobile postpaid ARPU during the same period, as described above.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €97.6 million, an increase of €95.6 million compared to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the increase in shareholder loan borrowed by us from Deutsche Telekom and the impact of adoption of IFRS 16, beginning from January 1, 2019.

This financial measure represents our operating liquidity. As of September 30, 2021, we had a working capital of €28.7 million, compared to a negative working capital of €85.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and a working capital of €142.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and €444.0 million as of December 31, 2018. The movement in our working capital across the periods under review generally reflects the significant growth of our business in such periods. In particular, negative working capital results from our business model and financial structure, that we believe to be typical for telecommunications service providers and is not a barrier to the normal operation of our business.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.38,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.38.2,,"Our liquidity requirements consist mainly of debt servicing requirements, investments in bolt-on acquisitions, Mobile Capital Expenditure and Fixed Infrastructure Capital Expenditure. Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been our net cash generated from operating activities, share capital increases, factoring arrangements entered into by us and borrowings under our financing arrangements, including financing facilities from Deutsche Telekom. Going forward, in addition to net cash generated from operating activities, we expect our principal sources of liquidity to include the Notes, drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement (including the RCF) and the factoring arrangements entered into by us from time to time. RCF1 under the Senior Facilities Agreement provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to €500.0 million in revolving credit, and RCF2 under the Senior Facilities Agreement provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to €200.0 million in revolving credit, both of which were undrawn as of September 30, 2021. Subject to certain exceptions and conditions, each of RCF1 and RCF2 may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed thereunder at any time in accordance with the Senior Facilities Agreement. For further information, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.” After the completion of the Transactions, we will have €800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding, €550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding and €2,400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans under the Senior Facilities Agreement (excluding amounts drawn by us from time to time under RCF1 and RCF2), in addition to certain other financial indebtedness as described under “Capitalization.” The Issuers are holding companies with no material operations or assets of their own. As a result, the Issuers will primarily depend on the cash flow generated by the operating subsidiaries of the Group and paid to the Issuers by way of interest payments under, or repayments of, the relevant intercompany loans or otherwise ----- to meet their obligations, including their respective obligations under the Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement. The relevant Issuer’s ability to pay cash interest on the Notes offered hereby will be determined by its cash available for debt service. As of September 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had €4,528.4 million in aggregate principal amount of third-party debt, including €760.7 million of lease liabilities under IFRS 16 and €17.7 million in respect of our factoring facilities. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating requirements, our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” For further information, see the section titled “Capitalization.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we incurred Mobile Capital Expenditure of €79.7 million, €143.0 million and €114.7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we expect to incur Mobile Capital Expenditure of approximately €103 million. Since the year ended December 21, 2018, we have continued with our initiatives to upgrade our mobile network, primarily through the installation of active antennas on the 1800MHz and 2600MHZ time division duplex bands. In particular, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we significantly increased our Mobile Capital Expenditure, primarily in relation to the preparation of the 5G rollout on the low band and adding extra capacity and coverage by preparing for introducing the 800MHz band into use. During the current period, the main focus of our Mobile Capital Expenditure has been in relation to the continuing rollout of the low bands 700/800/900Mhz networks and ramping up the 1800/2100Mhz hardware replacement. - Fixed Capital Expenditure, which represents capital expenditure necessary to maintain and expand our fixed infrastructure, and is primarily related to (i) capacity extension and upgrades of our fixed infrastructure, (ii) investments in active equipment in new roll-out areas, (iii) customer-premise equipment for new customers and (iv) quality improvements and phase out of legacy networks. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we incurred Fixed Capital Expenditure of €22.3 million, €64.5 million and €79.6 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we expect to incur Fixed Capital Expenditure of approximately €106 million, Prior to the year ended December 31, 2019, we had a relatively small fixed network. With the acquisition of Tele2 on January 2, 2019, we expanded our owned base of fixed network infrastructure. Since then, along with the growth of our fixed subscriber base, we have sought to expand our fixed network, and one of the key drivers of increase in our Fixed Capital Expenditure during the periods under discussion, has been in relation to customer-premise equipment for new customers. In addition, our Fixed Capital Expenditure initiatives have also been focused on addition of capacity in respect of our T-Mobile Thuis network so as to accommodate the continued growth of our fixed network subscribers, as well as improving the quality, and where appropriate, phasing-out of legacy fixed networks. - IT Capital Expenditure, which represents capital expenditure relating to the ongoing IT transformation and our cloud-first strategy. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we incurred IT Capital Expenditure of €41.6 million, €44.6 million and €38.7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we expect to incur IT Capital Expenditure of approximately €44 million. Since the year ended December 31, 2018, our IT Capital Expenditure initiatives have been focused on the implementation of customer relationship management or “CRM”-related upgrades to our IT systems and infrastructure, including digitization initiatives to supports our B2C and B2B segments. In addition, since the year ended December 31, 2019, we have implemented a new vertical sourcing model, so as to move our IT systems to a cloud-based network. - Other Capital Expenditure, which represents certain other heads of capital expenditures incurred by us, such as in relation to the acquisition and post-acquisition integration related capital ----- expenditure as well as certain other miscellaneous heads of capital expenditure such as in relation building facilities and retail outlets. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2019, we incurred Other Capital Expenditure of €2.7 million, €38.8 million and €35.9 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021 we expect to incur Other Capital Expenditure of approximately €36 million. The higher Capital Expenditure from 2019 onwards is primarily in relation to the integration of our Tele2 acquisition. In relation to the Tele2 acquisition, which we completed on January 2, 2019, the key focus of capital expenditure was in relation to postacquisition integration initiatives, particularly in relation to increasing our mobile network to accommodate all Tele2 traffic and subscribers and to phase-out the Tele2 mobile network. In relation to the Simpel acquisition, which we completed on December 1, 2020, our capital expenditure was relatively limited. In connection with the Acquisition, we expect to incur capital expenditure under the Transition Services Agreement, particularly in relation to the separation of our management functions from Deutsche Telekom, ring-fencing of our systems and operations, obtaining of new licenses and entering into new contracts, and the migration of some of our operation systems to an independent network. See also “Summary—Summary Financial _Information and Other Data—Capital Expenditure Data.”_ For the year ended December 31, 2021, we expect to incur a total capital expenditure of approximately €289 million.

We have no significant concentrations of credit risk and maintain policies to ensure that sales are made to customers with an adequate credit history. Our clients primarily consist of consumers and businesses with low average balances which are regularly reviewed. When necessary, these consumers are disconnected from service when no payment is received. Credit risk is taken into account through a combination of specific and general valuation allowances. We have policies to limit exposure to risks assumed in respect to customers and financial institutions, exposure to risk of recovering receivables and loans is managed as part of our ordinary activities. We have policies to ensure that sales of products on a wholesale basis are made to customers, including both B2B and B2C customers, with an adequate credit history. Several debt collection agencies are commissioned to collect ----- outstanding receivables and inform us about the status of doubtful debts. This valuation is done by the agencies based on complex models taking various indications into account. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. We have therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 12 to 45 months, depending on the segment, and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

Liberalization was gradually imposed over the following seven years and after its privatization in 1989 and listing in 1994. In 1995, an additional Global System for Mobile communication (“GSM”) license in the mobile segment was awarded to Libertel (now known as VFZ). In 1996/1997, the liberalization of the fixed segment was initiated by opening up fixed infrastructure. Two national licenses were awarded to Telfort and Enertel along with KPN as the incumbent and about 1,400 regional infrastructure licenses were awarded to approximately 160 other companies. In 1998, digital cellular system licenses at 1,800 MHz were awarded to Telfort, Teledanmark/Proximus, which was launched as Ben and is now part of TMNL, and France Telecommunications, which was launched as Federa and was bought by TMNL in 2007. These market participants all expanded their product offerings, introduced new technologies and enhanced the telecommunications market. The Dutch telecommunications sector has experienced multiple instances of consolidation. In 2008, three of the largest cable operators – Home, Casema and Multikabel – formed Ziggo, which eventually was acquired by Liberty Global. Subsequently, Liberty Global formed in The Netherlands a joint venture with Vodafone, creating the large national converged cable operator VFZ. A condition of the European Commission’s regulatory approval of this joint venture was that Vodafone had to divest its Dutch fixed line broadband business, Thuis, which was acquired by TMNL in December 2016. Deutsche Telekom Group originally entered the Dutch telecommunications market through its acquisition of operator Ben Nederland Holding B.V. in 2002 and Orange Nederland N.V., Orange Nederland Breedband B.V. in 2007, and later acquired the Dutch operations of Swedish MNO Tele2 Sverige AB in January 2019. Today, TMNL, KPN and VFZ are the major operators in the country. Following the global financial crisis of 2009 and the takeover attempt by América Móvil of KPN in 2012, the Dutch government’s view on a fully open market changed slightly. The government made various regulatory commitments to protect Dutch consumers and foster healthy competition. In 2011, The Netherlands became the first European country to pass net neutrality legislation, preventing leading market operators from charging consumers extra for certain data traffic. In 2019, the Dutch industry regulator, Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (“ACM”), through guidance detailed a framework to prevent bottlenecks in FTTHrollout, therein highlighting options such as joint investment and temporary protection at municipal level for first movers. The objectives of consumer and technology protection for the vital telecommunications sector also has resulted in a revised Telecommunication Sector Act, passed on May 19, 2020, with the purpose of further protecting Dutch national security and public order. Under this reform, the Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate must be notified if a party intention to acquire ‘a controlling interest’ in a ‘telecom party’ if such interest results in ‘relevant influence’ in the Dutch telecommunications sector. If an acquisition leads to disproportionate influence over Dutch national security and public order, the Minister can prohibit the transaction. Although wholesale regulation which required operators to sign commercial agreements to gain access to KPN’s fixed network was repealed in 2020, the Dutch telecommunications supervisory board (ACM) is considering whether to reinforce the legislation after reviewing it this year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Many telecommunications operators and smaller tower companies across The Netherlands are executing, or considering, tower network sales to other operators and independent telecommunications infrastructure tower companies. The major independent tower company in The Netherlands is Cellnex, which offers network as a service, allowing customers to operate their own networks, without maintaining own passive network infrastructure, by paying a flat fee per site or a variable cost per gigabyte (“GB”) consumed. Cellnex builds and maintains the distributed antenna system (“DAS”), to which the MNOs connect. Cellnex entered the Dutch market in 2016 with its acquisition of Protelindo and Shere Group in 2016, as well as Alticom in 2017. On September 1, 2018, TMNL carved out its tower business by way of a legal demerger (juridische splitsing) to Cignal Infrastructure. As part of a later transaction, Cignal Infrastructure was transferred to Cellnex Netherlands B.V. T-Mobile Netherlands maintains access to Cellnex’s ----- passive infrastructure elements through a master services agreement. Cellnex now operates a total of 4,314 sites, with 180 new sites to be rolled out in the next seven years. VFZ owns its portfolio of towers of approximately 3,000 sites.

In terms of allocation of frequency rights between the dominant market players, TMNL secured 70 MHz and KPN and VFZ 75 MHz each. All MNOs have since expanded their 5G networks, with VFZ reporting in July 2020 that it had reached a population coverage of more than 80% on its 5G network. In October 2020, TMNL reported that its 5G mobile network reached 90% of the Dutch population, making it the first MNO to provide nationwide 5G coverage. Finally, in April 2021, KPN estimated that their 5G network reached approximately 72% of the Dutch population.

While lines with connection speeds greater than 100 Mbps increased in 2020, this was mainly reflected in high-speed data processed via fiber-optic connections, representing a 30.1% increase, whereas DSL and cable connections increased by 0.9% and 1.3% respectively. This demonstrates the proportionate relationship between the number of high data subscribers and upgrades of network infrastructure and technology. Two of the three largest MNOs, VFZ and KPN, hold key positions in the market for fixed broadband retail connections, with a revenue market share of 45% and 41% respectively, with TMNL currently holding a 6% share. ----- _B2C fixed broadband revenue (in € million) Note: (1) TMNL data includes Tele2 historical data and (2) TMNL, KPN, VFZ and Other data represents service revenue in the segment for the year.

Although fixed telephony is considered a mature, declining market, the operators benefit from the service by bundling it with other telecommunications services. In 2020, only 17% of fixed telephony retail connections were contracted individually. The remaining 37% was in 4P bundles, 40% in 3P bundles and 6% in 2P bundles. In 2020, the network traffic per fixed line decreased by 30.9% whereas broadband network traffic increased by 14.7%. The majority of consumers have replaced their fixed telephones with mobiles and most digital interactions now take place either online or via mobile networks. As a result of the shift from fixed to mobile telephony, fixed telephony revenues have decreased by 71% since 2013. _Revenue fixed network (in € million) Source: ACM Monitor_",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

FMC can be driven by consumer demand and by operators seizing opportunities and locking in customers, leveraging either a fixed or a mobile asset that competitors may not have. _Product bundles penetration (% of total subscribers)_ ----- _Source: ACM Monitor_ The Dutch telecommunications market has shifted over recent years. The number of fixed-mobile product bundles (4P, 3P and 2P bundles) has increased every year from an aggregate of 5.6 million in 2013 to 7.0 million in 2020, with penetration of fixed-mobile product bundles increasing from 4.9% to 36.6% over this period. There has been a steady increase in the popularity of 4P bundles, growing each year from approximately 0.4 million in 2013 to 2.9 million in 2020. Meanwhile, 3P bundle subscriptions increased from 3.5 million in 2013 to 3.9 million in 2016, before falling back to 2 million in 2020 as 4P bundles grew in popularity. Consumers with 2P bundle subscriptions have increased from 1.7 million in 2013 to 2.1 million in 2020 (source: _ACM Monitor). In 2020, TMNL held a 5-10% retail market share of bundled services. VFZ held a 45-50%_ market share, while KPN and DELTA Fiber held 35-40% and 5-10% market share, respectively. DELTA Fiber does not offer retail bundles containing mobile (source: ACM Monitor). FMC will be further enabled by cross-selling a large mobile base and through the upselling of fixed services to mobile customers, which will spur growth in the consumer market. In 2021, TMNL’s brand Tele2 launched various FMC multi-brand offerings that are aimed to improve loyalty, both by serving the existing customer base and by establishing brands that cater to new customers within the whole household.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Between 2013 and 2020, fiber connections for television in The Netherlands increased by a factor of 1.7x _(source: ACM Monitor). Fiber provides customers with good quality picture while simultaneously allowing operators to reduce operating costs in the long run. _Television subscriptions per connection type (in millions of lines) Source: ACM Monitor_ The rapid growth of OTT streaming services, both advertisement-based video on demand (“AVOD”) and subscription-based video on demand (“SVOD”), has impacted traditional pay-TV operators that use satellite and cable to offer subscription television services. As KPN launched its IPTV package as part of its convergence strategy and eventually launched 4P bundles, competitors had to act accordingly and improve their own convergence service offerings. Despite VFZ’s leading position in the market, the company now offers Netflix on all of its set-top boxes. In 2015, KPN launched KPN Play, which eventually was discontinued in 2018 due to a lack of demand. TMNL subsequently closed its own OTT offering, Knippr, the same year. Nevertheless, in 2020 The Netherlands had the third highest percentage of its national population streaming internet TV or videos compared to 37 other European countries, due to significant growth of companies offering streaming media as a core service. In 2020, 95% of the Dutch population who used the internet within the last three months used it to watch internet-streamed TV or videos, compared to 90% and 84% in 2018 and 2016, respectively (source: Eurostat). ----- _Internet-streamed TV or videos (% of population who use internet)_ 95% 90% 84% 74% 70% 68% 2016 2018 2020 Netherlands EU _Source: Eurostat_ Pay-TV subscriptions in The Netherlands decreased by 8% between 2013 and 2020 (source: ACM _Monitor).

KPN upgraded its terrestrial television service, digitenne, to the digital video broadcasting – second generational terrestrial (DVB-T2) standard to free up 700 MHz for mobile traffic. Similarly, in April 2021 VFZ finalized its process of turning off its analogue cable television so that capacity for broadband could be increased. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

One factor contributing to the negative trend in voice is the transition from traditional telephony to integrated solutions (e.g., Cloud PBX solutions that provide telephone server access over a cloud-based internet network). _B2B mobile revenue (in € million) Note: (1) TMNL service revenues include revenues from IT Partners and DeanOne and (2) TMNL, KPN, VFZ and Other data represents ARPU in the segment for the year multiplied by the average number of SIMs at the end of the period for the presented and previous year multiplied by 12. Source: Publicly available sources/Management estimates._ The decline of the fixed market is partially a result of the transformation from legacy (copper, PSTN/ ISDN) to new IP services (fiber-based). Although the B2B fixed market is going through a transformation as voice declines, this is offset by the growth of data and broadband, and management expects stabilization with growing revenues in the market. KPN holds a leading position that it leverages by locking in business customers with unified communications solutions that integrate various communication services, such as instant messaging, voice, and video conferencing. VFZ historically has been focusing on small to mid-size enterprise customers, which is a current growth segment.

The fixed connectivity segment is mainly driven by demand for internet and data networks, which in turn is fueled by the shift from cable to fiber. Pursuant to regulatory refinements, KPN and VFZ are no longer required to maintain a wholesale offer for virtual access to their networks. Since 1997, KPN was obligated to provide wholesale access to its copper and fiber network, and since October 2018 VFZ was obligated to provide wholesale access to its cable network. In a landmark decision in March 2020, the regulator (ACM) found that KPN and VFZ together held significant market power. However, after a national appeal, this decision was annulled by the CBb in March 2020. The court held that there was not sufficient evidence to establish joint dominance on the retail market by KPN and VFZ. As a result, these companies are no longer obligated to provide wholesale access to their networks, although KPN has chosen to continue to offer wholesale access of both copper and fiber to other operators.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

TMNL relies on access to KPN’s networks but recently submitted two requests to ACM to have KPN regulated again and enforce wholesale access against regulated wholesale tariffs (source: Company _information). Despite wholesale access no longer being regulated at this time, ACM has been granted a new_ regulatory tool (symmetric access) to impose access obligations, in addition to the market analysis route it has had for decades. A draft market analysis decision of the ACM is expected to be published towards the end of 2021, following its press release in July 2021, that it will conduct research and take a decision on the need (and ----- if so, the way) to regulate fixed access. According to this press release, the ACM sees a risk that KPN may restrict its access conditions. In February 2021, the Dutch Minister of Finance sent a letter to the Dutch Parliament reflecting an intention to revise consumer credit regulation in The Netherlands by lowering the threshold for document verification required to obtain a loan for a mobile device. So far, no legislative proposal has been submitted to Parliament to execute this intention and a decision has not been made whether to submit such a proposal. With regards to data roaming, there will potentially be stricter quality of service provisions as EU bodies are in a process of reviewing roaming regulations including a potential reduction of the wholesale and/or retail tariffs in the future. In April 2021, Dutch mobile operators received a decision from the Dutch government on the basis of which Chinese vendors are restricted from supplying specific components to the core mobile network and service platforms of Dutch telecom providers. The Dutch MNOs are granted a transition period to replace the current equipment and the transition period is in line with TMNL’s usual replacement and rotation cycle. The auction of the 3.5 GHz is expected to take place in the latter half of 2022, but this could be delayed to 2023 due to a court case initiated by Inmarsat, a British satellite telecommunications company, which currently uses the spectrum for safety communications at sea.

We offer mobile (both postpaid and prepaid) and fixed telecommunications services to both B2C and B2B customers, and we also sell handsets to our customers. We are the largest mobile telecommunications provider in the Dutch consumer market by mobile service revenue and number of SIMs, we have been ranked as the best mobile network in The Netherlands for the fifth year in a row, and we have also been ranked as the top network in the world (Source: Umlaut, The _2021 Mobile Network Test in The Netherlands; PresseBox, T-Mobile Awarded “Best in Test” Worldwide by Umlaut)._ As of September 30, 2021, we had 6.9 million mobile subscribers and 0.7 million fixed subscribers, representing an increase of approximately 29% and 24%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2018. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions and other adjustments, our combined mobile service revenues totaled €1,215.1 million, our combined fixed line services revenue totaled €391 million, and our revenue from the sale of goods and services, and other revenues totaled €443 million. Mobile service revenue combines mobile revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as visitor roaming, and our fixed line services revenue combines fixed line revenue from our B2C and B2B segments as well as fixed line wholesale revenue. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, pro forma for our acquisitions and other adjustments, our revenue for the B2C segment totaled €1,239 million and for the B2B segment was €292 million. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was €637.4 million. TMNL traces its origins back to 2002, when Deutsche Telekom entered the Dutch market through the acquisition of Ben, which it subsequently rebranded as T-Mobile in 2003. In 2007, we acquired Orange Netherlands, making us the third largest mobile operator in The Netherlands after Koninklijke KPN N.V. (“KPN”) and VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V. (“VFZ”). In 2016, we acquired Vodafone’s fixed business, Vodafone Thuis, which was subsequently renamed to TMNL Thuis. This transaction marked our entry into the fixed market, adding approximately 150,000 fixed line customers. Through the TMNL Thuis acquisition, we also gained access to a dark fiber footprint on KPN’s fiber network (KPN ODF). In January 2019, we completed the acquisition of Tele2, strengthening our position in the Dutch market, across all segments. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, an online-only SIM-only MVNO on our network, focusing in particular on the low budget segment of the market. The Simpel acquisition further strengthened our position, making us the leader both in terms of B2C mobile postpaid SIM cards and service revenues. We continue to operate the Simpel brand after its acquisition in 2020. In April 2021, we announced a strategic partnership with Open Dutch Fiber, a company owned by KKR and DTCP that plans to roll-out fiber services to over one million homes passed. We are the anchor tenant on this network which focuses on dense, urban areas in which we currently have a large mobile market share. The Open Dutch Fiber partnership is an example of our asset-light model and lean operational setup, which we believe enables us to streamline our business and optimize our indirect cost base ratio. We provide our B2C customers with a multi-brand portfolio of mobile services, including voice, messaging and broadband aiming to cover all segments of the market from premium to low-budget and operating on our own networks of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G spectra. Through T-Mobile Thuis, we offer nationwide fixed broadband, TV and fixed voice services with FTTH and xDSL (copper) technologies. In addition, and in line with market trends, we offer B2C customers packages that bundle mobile and fixed telecommunications services at attractive prices, known as FMC packages. Our B2B business segment is dedicated to meeting the connectivity needs of companies of all types and sizes as we offer a broad range of telecommunications solutions, cloud-based and unified communications solutions. The chart below sets forth key events in our growth and transformation to the largest mobile telecommunications provider in The Netherlands’ B2C market and an established mobile-led FMC challenger. ----- We have invested heavily in our offerings and we believe we have successfully repositioned our business through innovation and change, as evidenced by our new offerings and services and by our being the first provider to offer nationwide 5G coverage on the 700 MHz band.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.59,Our Competitive Strengths,17.59.1,Attractive telecommunications market structure in The Netherlands,"We operate in The Netherlands, which has a sizeable and attractive telecommunications market which consists of three main telecommunications providers. The Netherlands is the 6[th ]largest economy in Europe and has a robust macroeconomic environment, with 2% real GDP growth expected for 2021, moderate population and household growth, and a large demand for high-quality communication services (Source: Telecompaper). We compete in both the mobile and the fixed markets with KPN and VFZ. We are the premier company in the B2C mobile market with a 42% market share as calculated by our number of postpaid SIM subscribers, as compared to a 30% market share for KPN and 25% for VFZ in the same market. The MVNO market is small accounting for approximately 4% market share of postpaid SIMs, with the largest MVNO, Youfone, having an approximately 3% market share based on number of SIM subscribers. In this context, we believe the risk of irrational behaviors by existing competitors is low and that existing MNOs are likely to compete primarily on the quality of their services. Following our acquisition of Tele2, the market players were further consolidated ----- from four to three and a process of revenue and ARPU stabilization started, similar to what has been seen in other markets such as Austria, Germany or Ireland. The Netherlands has one of the lowest ARPU levels in Europe. We also believe that the risk of a new MNO entering the market is low. We believe that this is due to the following factors: (i) the highly converged nature of the market, making it less attractive for new entrants, as they must be able to offer both mobile and fixed offers to be competitive therein and (ii) the lack of any viable spectrum auction that could allow the entrance of a new player, since the upcoming 5G spectrum auction in The Netherlands is planned to offer only a specific band of spectrum and we do not need to renew our existing spectrum licenses until 2030, making the auction more suitable for existing MNOs and unsuitable for new entrants. The most recent possibility for a new entrant to obtain a marketable spectrum allocation would have been the 2020 multi-band spectrum auction. However, only the three main players in the telecommunications market, namely KPN, VFZ and us, participated in the auction. Additionally, we believe that the competitive risk posed by MVNOs is low because MVNOs have limited ability to compete on unlimited subscriptions in light of each MVNO’s lack of owned network and their limited ability to cover FMC packages, as well as such unlimited plans’ impact on costs. Indeed, the number of MVNOs has decreased by half from approximately 60 to approximately 30 in The Netherlands over the last six years. Furthermore, we anticipate that the B2C mobile market will continue to grow as data traffic continues to increase. Indeed, our B2C mobile pro forma service revenues grew by 3.1% in 2020 (after a 4.1% decrease in 2019) despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Key trends include: (i) Growth in postpaid SIMs subscriptions, which is driven both by prepaid to postpaid subscription migration and by population growth, as well as trends of increasing proportions of multi-SIM subscriptions; and (ii) Growth in mobile ARPU as driven by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services, value-added services as well as overall inflation and the telecommunications market’s shift towards larger data bundles. We believe that B2C ARPU will grow in the future due to these factors, even though mobile ARPUs had decreased in The Netherlands in past years because of intense price competition and mobile discounting as part of FMC offers, mainly triggered by KPN and VFZ. The following table sets out historical trends in B2C mobile services ARPU across our brands and our two major competitors, KPN and VFZ, and demonstrates that while ARPU among our competitors has generally decreased in recent years, ARPU among our brands has generally increased or stabilized. ----- _Source: Company information and publicly available information adjusted based on management estimates._ The B2B market has seen similar developments. In particular, ARPU in the SOHO/VSE segment follows consumer market trends, driven as in the B2C market by growth in unlimited subscriptions, 5G services and value-added services, and we believe those drivers will continue to push ARPU growth. In the B2B market generally, we believe that growth in subscribers will be driven by growth in SOHO/VSE businesses, an increased adoption of mobile services in the B2B market and an increasing adoption of converged telecommunications solutions. Additionally, the Dutch fixed telecommunications market has benefitted from infrastructure upgrades in recent years that have contributed to a growing market, in spite of declining telephony and peaking TV, primarily due to a higher demand for broadband services at higher speeds, which is our core product offering within the fixed segment. Historically, the fixed internet market in The Netherlands was dominated by KPN and VFZ, which have a combined market share of approximately 80%. We have positioned ourselves as a challenger in this market, focusing on providing fast broadband services and offering competitive and sustainable pricing. In the future, we believe that growth in the fixed market will be driven by (i) an increase in subscribers associated with household growth and (ii) premium customers’ willingness to pay for ultrafast fiber and better quality, which allows for more-for-more strategies and results in increasing demand for higher fiberbased data bundles. FTTH coverage is expanding in The Netherlands and the B2C and B2B markets are expected to benefit from such expansion. We expect to benefit from this trend through what we call our ‘Magenta’ footprint, which includes several Optical Distribution Framework-type of agreements and partnerships with, among others, Open Dutch Fiber, KPN’s affiliate Reggefiber Operator B.V. and Primevest Capital Partners, where we expect to eventually have access to over three million households at sustainable commercial terms. The remaining households can be reached by Wholesale Broadband Access (“WBA”)-type of access on KPN copper (until its planned phase-out over the next three years) and/or fiber network.

As of December 31, 2020, we have 42% of the B2C mobile postpaid market share by volume, which corresponds to 5.1 million SIMs. We have managed to reach our leading volume market share of 42% over the past three years, supported in part by the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, while the absolute number of subscribers grew at a CAGR of 4.5% between 2018 and 2020. At the same time, our market share by revenue increased from 33% to 40% over the same period. Our B2C mobile revenue growth in the past three years was mainly driven by stable ARPUs at brand levels and a growing subscriber base, driven by marketing strategies for our brands, our strong positioning in unlimited bundles on T-Mobile and Tele2, and an increase in demand for cheaper bundles with Ben and Simpel. We have also maintained growth in customer satisfaction, which has helped us retain customers. In the B2C mobile market, TMNL outpaced its competitors in The Netherlands by delivering the fastest-increasing customer satisfaction TRI*M score over the last decade. TRI*M is a customer satisfaction metric widely adopted within the Deutsche Telekom Group which combines customer recommendation, customer likelihood to continue services, competitive advantage and performance. Our TRI*M score increased by over 50% over 12 years. We believe that an increase in customer satisfaction was one of the key factors driving the reduction in our B2C mobile churn to approximately 11% in 2020. We believe that our position as a leading B2C mobile operator with growing customer satisfaction metrics situates us well to take advantage of trends towards converged fixed and mobile offerings and morefor-more strategies, as it allows us a larger base of customers to cross-sell into FMC packages and to upsell into more premium offers.

This track record, combined with a lean, asset-light fixed business model has given us operating leverage and operational efficiency. In 2016, we acquired Vodafone’s B2C fixed business, Vodafone Thuis, which we shortly thereafter rebranded T-Mobile Thuis. Vodafone’s divestiture of Vodafone Thuis was ordered by the European Commission as a remedy to provide competition clearance for VFZ, the joint venture between Vodafone and Ziggo. This acquisition marked the beginning of our present fixed internet business and added about 150,000 fixed-line customers. In January 2019, we completed our acquisition of Tele2. This acquisition has strengthened our position in the Dutch telecommunications market and allowed us to compete more effectively with KPN and VFZ by giving us enhanced scale, combined spectrum resources and significant synergy potential. We are executing a three-year plan to realize synergies from our acquisition of Tele2 in 2019. We have closed Tele2’s standalone stores and we are in the process of implementing significant operations costs savings. Based on our estimates, we anticipate realizing Tele2 cost-saving synergies with a total run-rate synergy potential of €130 million by 2024, of which we have already realized €115 million of synergies run-rate as of September 30, 2021. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Simpel, by then the largest MVNO in The Netherlands. By means of this transaction, we acquired one million additional B2C mobile postpaid customers who were already using our network under Simpel’s prior wholesale agreement with us. The acquisition of Simpel provide further synergy and cost savings potential to be realized in the total amount of approximately €9 million by 2024. Synergies related to Tele2 and Simpel entail for example related to reduced interconnect costs, migration of Tele2’s business support system (“BSS”) to our Magenta stack, synergies in respect of bad debt collections (representing improved client acceptance and collection practices implemented upon integration with TMNL), direct and indirect cost savings related to the discontinuance of the Tele2 network and the cancellation of leased telecommunications towers, reduction in marketing expenses as a result of mobile cross-selling, optimization of campaigning periods, reduction in other indirect costs such as personnel related costs as well as legal audit and tax fees. For risks related to our growth through acquisitions, see “Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, including the risk that we may not be able to integrate newly acquired operations into our business, which may prevent us from realizing the strategic and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and thus adversely affect our business.”_ We believe that these strategic acquisitions, coupled with our rapid and successful organic growth initiatives, position us well to capture further market share and grow margins across the business segments in which we operate. Further, our lean and digital business model also allows us to benefit from strong operating leverage. Aside from the lean operating cost base described above, we have also repositioned ourselves to become a digital telecommunications company with an asset-light fixed model. On September 1, 2018, we demerged our tower business into Cignal Infrastructure (at demerger and until June 2021, T-Infra). Subsequently, on January 1, 2019, one day prior to the closing of the Tele2 acquisition, we distributed Cignal Infrastructure as a dividend in kind to Deutsche Telekom, with TMNL continuing to have full access to the contributed infrastructure through a long-term, arms-length service agreement. In June 2021, Deutsche Telekom sold Cignal Infrastructure to Digital Infrastructure Vehicle 1 SCSP, which is a joint venture of Cellnex and DTCP. Currently, we benefit from access to 3,150 towers owned by Cignal Infrastructure with nationwide coverage under a long term contract for an initial term of 15 years, with the option for T-Mobile Netherlands to renew for two additional periods of 10 years each, and at favorable terms consisting of a capped yearly cost increase in line with the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, we continue to hold our own market-leading mobile spectrum portfolio. In our fixed segment we also have an asset-light model. Our partners, Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest, are conducting the roll-out of our FTTH network, and we do not have any direct fixed access network ownership. We expect to have access to the over one million FTTH homes that Open Dutch Fiber is scheduled to roll out to by 2025 in densely-populated areas with strong TMNL mobile customer presence. Under the ----- Primvest partnership, we expect that we will have FTTH access to approximately 130,000 homes passed. By the terms of this partnership, we benefit from an initial period of exclusivity and line prices with base rates of not more than €15 per month, indexed to inflation and subject to certain adjustments. In both of these partnerships, we have agreed to certain utilization commitments. In addition, we have access to approximately two million homes passed on KPN’s Open Distribution Framework footprint which is completed by WBA for a nationwide fixed network footprint. Such a lean business model has allowed us to achieve total capital expenditure savings of over €700 million, estimated as savings as a result of us not having to allocate and devote capital expenditure on building a fiber network and mobile towers for five years.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.62,Simpel,17.62.3,Strong cash flow profile with demonstrated resilience and strong cash generation,"We have historically demonstrated a track record of growth, profitability improvement and strong cash flow generation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to maintain growth and increase profitability, as evidenced by a 29.7% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin in 2020 in comparison to 26.7% in 2019. We believe this demonstrates the resilience of our business and of our company overall. In addition, we generated a 56% Cash Conversion in 2020 in comparison with an average level of 30% for other international telecommunication companies. We delivered revenue growth in a challenging market environment between 2018 and 2020 at a 2% CAGR. Such growth was mainly driven by a growing subscriber base and stabilizing ARPU levels in the mobile B2C segment, as well as by strong growth in our B2C fixed business. Historically, our B2C mobile segment has been the major contributor to revenue at a 4% CAGR between 2018 and 2020, having accounted for 47% of total revenue in 2020. Our B2C mobile business delivered significant SIM net adds, particularly in the Simpel and Ben brands, and relatively stable ARPUs among those of our brands that offered the increasingly-popular unlimited data bundles. Positive developments offset a decrease in roaming revenue as a result of COVID-19– induced travelling restrictions. Our B2C fixed segment was our fastest-growing segment, growing at a CAGR of 11% over the past three years. We believe that this strong growth was driven by a successful FMC challenger strategy which resulted in strong growth in subscriber base that amounted to an additional 133,000 customers in the past three years. We also delivered strong performance in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL, both in terms of margin expansion and growth. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL Margin increased from 22.8% in 2018 to 29.7% in 2020 and to 31.1% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL exhibited a strong CAGR of 16.1% between 2018 and 2020 due to an improved gross margin, declining indirect costs in absolute terms from cost saving programs and headcount reduction, and realization of Tele2 synergies. Because we delivered strong revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA AcL expansion through challenging market conditions, we believe that we are in a position of strength and greater scale to deliver incremental top line and profitability expansion as market conditions improve. We also benefit from a strong cash generation profile driven by a solid top-line performance that is combined with prudent cost management and moderate capital expenditure needs. Our Underlying Operating Free Cash Flow increased by 53% in 2020 compared to 2019, and is expected to continue on a growth trajectory going forward as we maintain our capital expenditure-light strategy. Our Cash Conversion was 56% in 2020 and it further increased to 58.9% during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, which is above the average level of 30% for other international telecommunication companies. The below chart shows our resilience and strong cash flow profile by presenting certain business metrics for the periods under review, on a pro forma basis for the Tele2 and Simpel acquisitions, the demerger of T-Infra and the application of IFRS 16, as applicable, in each case from January 1, 2018.

B2C revenue growth resulted from ----- stabilizing ARPUs in 2019 and 2020 as well as a growing subscriber base, further supported by growth in unlimited bundles on T-Mobile and Tele2 as well as an increasing demand for cheaper bundles with Ben and Simpel. We have also seen continued growth in our customer satisfaction. For B2C mobile, we have delivered the fastest increasing customer satisfaction TRI*M score over the last decade, having outpaced our competitors in The Netherlands. Our leading market position provides a strong platform for growth both in terms of volume and value across all brands and segments. In particular, we plan to grow ARPU through (i) 5G monetization, (ii) unlimited growth, (iii) portfolio optimizations, (iv) value-added services and (v) FMC growth. _Drive 5G monetization_ We were the first operator to reach nationwide 5G coverage on the 700 MHz band in 2020, and we believe that we are well positioned to monetize our 5G investments. We offer 5G connectivity per default to our premium offerings, such as T-Mobile’s ‘Unlimited plan,’ or as an add-on to our value offerings, such as a €2 p.c.m. add-on for our Tele2 customers. In the future, we plan to extend our 5G offering and continue our more-for-more portfolio approach on the back of 5G. _Grow unlimited offerings_ We believe that we hold a leading position in unlimited offerings based on our number of subscribers and on our having been the first to have introduced an unlimited plan for mobile in The Netherlands. Our premium offers in the mobile segment are unlimited plans, which we sell for €35 p.c.m. and €25 p.c.m., including value added tax (“VAT”), through the T-Mobile and Tele2 brands respectively. T-Mobile’s ‘Unlimited plan’ also includes 5G connectivity by default. Having introduced these offerings in 2017, our unlimited subscriber base grew from 578,000 subscribers in December 2018 to more than a million subscribers in June 2021. In May 2021, we also introduced an ‘Unlimited & Entertainment’ plan including access to Netflix and Videoland, a Dutch streaming service. We intend to continue to grow our unlimited offerings in the future as we believe that unlimited plans are a key value driver in our premium portfolio by increasing customer loyalty and customer satisfaction, and ultimately result in above-average monthly recurring charges (“MRC”). _Portfolio optimizations_ Our multi-brand portfolio is a key value driver that allows us to effectively compete in all market segments. All our brands have a distinctive positioning, minimizing the risk of intra-brand competition. With approximately 100,000 intra-brand migrations in 2020, creating an average incremental MRC of €1, we have proven the ability to upsell to customers within our portfolio, accruing value. _Value-added services_ We believe that by offering value-added services (“VAS”), we distinguish ourselves from our competitors while increasing ARPU, customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. Our new ‘Unlimited & Entertainment’ package, described above, is one such example. In addition, T-Mobile offers security options and add-ons from the music streaming service Deezer. On Tele2, we recently introduced ‘Unlimited for a day’ and ‘Unlimited weekend’ plans which add VAS to a Tele2 portfolio that already includes, among other things, a 5G priced add-on. _FMC growth_ Compared to KPN and VFZ, who have mobile FMC penetrations of 65% and 71% as of December 31, 2020, we believe that our FMC penetration of 8% as of December 31, 2020 provides us with ample opportunity for growth. While KPN and VFZ leverage their large fixed bases, we intend to focus on crossselling our fixed offerings into our leading consumer mobile base. Since FMC customers are more loyal, more satisfied and have higher monthly bill sizes compared to one-product customers, we expect FMC growth to be attractive, both, in terms of volume and value. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.63,Our Strategy,17.63.2,Capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus,"We are a successful challenger in the B2C fixed market with approximately 9% market share by subscribers in 2020. In the past three years, as our business has grown its subscriber base and revenue at a CAGR of approximately 11%, marking the fastest growth among our competitors, our market share has grown from 7% in 2018 to 9% in 2020 and our share of total subscriber gross adds has grown from 17% in 2018 to 20% in 2020. We believe that we have been able to deliver this rapid, market-leading growth by leveraging our challenger strategy and B2C fixed ARPUs below those of our competition, as our fixed ARPU was approximately €33 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the market average of approximately €50. Our price leadership is evidenced by our FMC offer which combines 1 Gbit internet speeds and a T-Mobile Unlimited subscription for a price of €50 p.m. (€25 p.m. internet + €25 p.m. mobile subscription), compared to €90 p.m. at KPN (€65 p.m. internet + €25 p.m. mobile) and €93 p.m. at VFZ (€65.5 p.m. internet + €27.5 p.m. mobile). These consumer bundle prices are excluding promotions. We believe this lower fixed-segment ARPU and challenger strategy represents a strong lever to continue attracting valueseeking customers. As illustrated in the chart below, we are able to offer fixed and mobile services at a significantly lower price than our competitors. We have an FTTH footprint that covers approximately 1.6 million homes passed on KPN’s and Primevest’s networks. FTTH is also achieved through the Magenta footprint. We expect a further increase of approximately 500,000 homes passed by the end of 2021 and the Magenta footprint is expected to significantly increase homes passed by 2025. Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest partnerships are also key pillars of this strategy. We have secured exclusive agreements with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest in addition to benefitting from non-exclusive ODF wholesale access to the KPN network, complemented by nationwide wholesale access via KPN bitstream. For more about our partnerships with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest, see “—Our _Competitive Strengths—High operational efficiency and an asset-light fixed model.” We believe that our_ partnerships with Open Dutch Fiber and Primevest in particular will allow us to grow our fixed subscriber base and drive margin expansion while maintaining healthy cash profile through our capital expenditure-light strategy. In the future, we plan to increase our revenue share through share gains at competitive ARPUs. First, we plan to tap our mobile subscriber base, which is the largest in The Netherlands, to cross-sell our fixed offerings to our mobile customers. In our T-Mobile brand, FMC penetration rose from 4% in 2018 to 20% in 2020, whereas overall for our company, FMC penetration increased from 2% in 2018 to 8% in 2020. However, our FMC penetration remains well below the FMC penetration of our competitors. We believe our penetration will grow in the future both as a result of a focused sales approach and because we expect more SIMs to become FMC-eligible in 2021-2022. Planned quality improvements will also help grow and maintain our fixed base through increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Second, we will rely on highly-competitive ARPU levels to further drive market share gains. Going forward, we are considering shifting towards a value-based proposition by focusing on high-end fiber speeds and value-added services. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.63,Our Strategy,17.63.3,Exploit untapped B2B value pools and expand in fixed,"We have established a presence in the B2B market across all segments, namely SOHO/VSE, SMB and LE/CE, both with our mobile and our fixed offerings which represent 71% and 29%, respectively, of our B2B revenue in 2020. Our presence extends across all B2B customer segments with our largest exposure in the SOHO/VSE and LE/CE segments at 36% of B2B mobile service revenues each, followed by the SMB segment with a 25% revenue share (Source: Company information). We have increased our revenue market share in the mobile B2B market from 17% in 2018 to 20% in 2020. For the past three years, we have the fastest-growing B2B mobile operator as measured by SIM net adds, having earned a 43% SIM net adds share in 2020 in comparison with 31% for the closest competitor. We believe this strategy highlights our success in attracting B2B mobile customers and managing churn well, and we believe it will fuel our growth in the coming years. In the fixed B2B market, we had a modest revenue market share of 4% in 2020, affording us an opportunity to grow our presence in the segment in 2021 and beyond. Among our key priorities, we aim to transform the former Tele2 large enterprise legacy business and expand into SOHO/VSE with fixed offerings. Recognizing the above growth path in B2B mobile and the opportunity in B2B fixed, we have defined a strategy to develop our potential in each of our SOHO/VSE, SMB and LE/CE B2B segments. Our entrepreneurial approach is built on four key growth drivers, namely (i) FMC offerings in the SOHO/VSE segment, (ii) an SMB portfolio that combines FMC offerings (a “converged” portfolio) with cloud-based service enhancements, (iii) a differentiating partner approach and (iv) fixed transformation in the LE/CE segment. _FMC offerings in the attractive SOHO/VSE segment_ The SOHO/VSE segment is a highly attractive market for our services, both because of its higher margins and because we believe we are well-positioned to succeed in this space as a result of its similarities with the B2C segment where we are a leader in mobile. This segment has rarely been tapped by either T-Mobile or Tele2 before and it is growing in line with the B2C market. See “—Our Competitive Strengths—Attractive _telecommunications market structure in The Netherlands.” Given our strength in mobile offerings in particular,_ we intend to target the SOHO/VSE segment by relying on FMC offerings. For example, in September 2021, we launched a VSE internet offering and related FMC bundling proposition in order to provide the best value for money, thus opening an additional market segment for us and a potential source of incremental revenue. _FMC and cloud-enhanced SMB portfolio along with differentiating partnering approach_ We operate in the SMB segment under the T-Mobile and selectively under the Tele2 brand for larger SMB customers. Our SMB offering comprises a product portfolio focused on FMC and cloud-enhanced solutions. In the SOHO/VSE segment, we strive for an increase of our Unlimited attach rate as a key value driver. In addition, we believe that our SMB FMC seats will increase, driven by, among other things, a Microsoft Teams integration that forms a unified communications solution which we were the first to launch in the Dutch market. We have a large mobile customer base and, as in the consumer market, we intend to upsell fixed and unified communications services to our mobile base. In addition to our core connectivity services, we sell a broad range of communications and cloud-based solutions tailored to the customers’ needs through our extensive partner portfolio. See also “—Capital-efficient fixed strategy with fiber focus” above. _Fixed transformation in LE/CE_ In the LE/CE segment, we are conducting a transformation of our fixed services in order to realize the full potential of our extended portfolio. We are in the process of a transition from Tele2 legacy fixed infrastructure to future-proof transactional stacks in order to accommodate changing customer demands that request faster and more reliable connections and thus are switching to future-proof fiber-based technologies which includes a shift from copper to fiber, from VPN to SDWAN and a phase-out of ISDN. We also intend to supplement our stable fixed wholesale business with international carriers and Internet Service Providers by wholeselling active services in ODF areas. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

We intend to build on our past ESG successes with a four-pillar ESG program. Our first pillar is sustainability. In 2020, we already used 100% green electricity and produced 60,000 kWh of renewable energy by using our own solar panels. In 2021, we introduced eco-plastic, E-SIMs and lighter packaging. Additionally, we have targeted a reduction to carbon neutral emission level by 2026. Furthermore, we will reduce new plastic packaging to zero by 2026. We continue to be involved in our community in other ways, such as our establishment of two partnerships to accelerate “Innovation for Society” projects in 2020. For 2021 and 2022, we aim to set up three impactful “Innovation for Society” partnerships to invest in e-health, education and smart cities. Going forward, we intend to continue setting up three partnerships a year. We also focus on digital inclusion, as our goal is to enable more people to be part of the digital society. In 2020, more than 2,500 people gained access to the digital society with our social SIM program and we reached more than 15,000 people through our debt prevention program. Our target is to reach more than 25,000 disadvantaged individuals every year. Lastly, our management aims to foster an environment in which everyone feels included. We have set up a dedicated work stream in the diversity and inclusion program focused on activities and awareness within the company, sharpened our policy on social return and set up a “Back to work” fund. For 2021 and 2022, our focus is on diversity and inclusion, such as through setting up gender-neutral communication and starting the dialogue on safety and belonging.

(“T-Mobile Netherlands Retail”) and, indirectly through Complex Bidco B.V., Simpel.nl B.V. (“Simpel”), (ii) T-Mobile Thuis B.V. (“T-Mobile Thuis”) and (iii) T-Mobile Netherlands Finance B.V. (“T-Mobile Netherlands Finance”). T-Mobile Netherlands Finance holds the financial markets license for consumer credit issued by AFM and is the contracting party for consumers obtaining credit for products provided by us. Our origins can be traced back to two acquisitions in The Netherlands by the group headed by Deutsche Telekom AG (the “Deutsche Telekom Group”). In September 2002, the Deutsche Telekom Group acquired the Dutch mobile operator Ben Nederland Holding B.V., whose name was then changed to T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. in February 2003. The Deutsche Telekom Group also rebranded Ben to T-Mobile in February 2003, marking the introduction of the T-Mobile brand in The Netherlands. In September 2007, we acquired Orange Nederland N.V. and Orange Nederland Breedband B.V. from the France Télécom S.A. group. The fixed line component of this business, acquired under Orange Nederland Breedband B.V., was eventually rebranded and sold in January 2014 under the Online.nl brand. In 2008, we relaunched Ben as a budget brand. In April 2010, we acquired the customer base and the ‘Simpel’ brand of the mobile service provider Simpel Consumenten B.V from its founder Jasper de Rooij. We transferred the customer base and brand back to de Rooij and investors in August 2014 by concluding an asset purchase agreement, and we also then signed an MVNO agreement with Simpel, the successor company of the business, under which Simpel continued to use our network. In December 2016, we acquired from Vodafone Libertel B.V. the B2C fixed line internet business of Vodafone Thuis in The Netherlands, which we renamed T-Mobile Thuis. Vodafone divested this business as the result of an antitrust remedy ordered by the European Commission to provide clearance for the VFZ joint venture. This acquisition added approximately 160,000 customers. On September 1, 2018, we carved out our tower business by way of a legal demerger (juridische _splitsing) from TMNL to Cignal Infrastructure (until June 2021, named T-Mobile Infra B.V.). As part of the_ demerger, Cignal Infrastructure was incorporated as a 100% subsidiary of T-Mobile Netherlands. On December 17, 2018, T-Mobile Netherlands and Cignal Infrastructure entered into a master services agreement governing the relationship between us and Cignal Infrastructure and the terms and conditions of our access to these passive infrastructure elements. Ultimately, Cignal Infrastructure was distributed as a dividend in kind to Deutsche Telekom on January 1, 2019. As part of a later transfer of Cignal Infrastructure to Cellnex Netherlands B.V., on May 27, 2021 T-Mobile Netherlands and Cignal Infrastructure entered into an amended and restated master lease agreement which replaced the master services agreement dated December 17, 2018. ----- On January 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Tele2. The seller, Tele2 Sweden, received approximately €190 million in cash and 25% of the issued and outstanding shares of TMNL. This transaction was subject to the approval of European antitrust authorities, and final and unconditional approval was obtained from the European Commission on November 27, 2018. This acquisition better enabled us to become an integrated telecommunications provider by deepening our capacity to offer fixed and mobile subscriptions. On December 1, 2020, we acquired Simpel pursuant to the exercise of a call option we had signed in July 2019 for the acquisition of 100% of Complex Bidco B.V. and its 100% subsidiary, Simpel. This transaction gained the unconditional approval of the ACM on November 16, 2020. Simpel had previously exclusively marketed SIM-only subscriptions through its own website, using SIM cards that operated on the T‑Mobile Netherlands network.

Customers in this segment are offered landline, mobile phone, broadband and bundled services mainly marketed under the T-Mobile, Tele2, Ben and Simpel brands. Specifically, we provide our B2C customers with the following multi-brand portfolio of services, aiming to cover all segments of the market: - Mobile services: we provide voice services, SMS/MMS and mobile broadband through our own networks of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G spectra, with 2G scheduled to be phased out shortly. We offer consumers mobile flexible bundled and unbundled service packages through our key brands: - T-Mobile: T-Mobile is our premium B2C mobile brand, focusing on premium-seekers and households. It offers 24-month and 12-month subscriptions and combines premium handset sales. This brand offers limited and unlimited data, text, and talk packages on both 4G and 5G spectra. Through T-Mobile Thuis, it also offers a fixed internet package with an option to purchase voice and TV add-ons, as well as FMC packages. We market our TMobile brand through an omni-channel approach, leveraging retail stores, online sales, telesales and indirect sales. T-Mobile’s key competitors include KPN and VFZ. ----- - Tele2: Tele2 is our value brand, aimed at value-seekers and digital natives. It also offers limited and unlimited bundles with 5G as an add-on, and it also offers handsets. We intend Tele2 to operate within its own value segment. - Ben: Ben is our budget-conscious brand. It offers SIM-only subscriptions in the 4G spectrum along with a basic portfolio of handsets. Key competitors include Simyo and Hollandsnieuwe, which are KPN’s and VFZ’s budget brands, respectively. - Simpel: Simpel is our low-budget mobile brand. It offers SIM-only subscriptions on the 4G spectrum exclusively through its website. Simpel’s key competitor is Youfone, which is an MVNO on the KPN network. - Fixed services: Through T-Mobile Thuis, we offer nationwide fixed broadband, TV and fixed voice services with FTTH and xDSL (copper) technologies. FTTH is offered via Primevest, Open Dutch Fiber and KPN networks based on unbundled access through an ODF access as well as VULA and WBA access with KPN. We also use KPN’s copper network based on unbundled access through MDF, VULA and WBA. We also offer to combine T-Mobile Thuis’s fixed service with T-Mobile or Tele2 subscriptions, as these FMC packages offer discounts and other benefits for the customer in comparison to standalone service purchase. _B2B segment_ Our B2B segment is dedicated to meeting the telecommunications needs of companies of all types and sizes as we aim to offer telecommunications solutions and cloud based services to businesses to accompany them in their growth. The B2B segment constituted 18.2% and 17.5% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. For both our SOHO/VSE customers and our SMB customers, we offer FMC bundles that combine fixed telephony landline, mobile phone, SMS/MMS, broadband and data services, as well as other value-added services such as data centers, Unified Communications, security, cloud, storage, virtual PBX, email and videoconferencing. These bundled services allow clients access to broadband internet and fixed and mobile telephony services which are invoiced jointly at competitive prices. Contracts from our LE/CE customers, by contrast, are typically awarded by customized, separate mobile and fixed services tenders, and may also include data network services. We additionally offer standalone B2B mobile services, notably through our ‘@Work’ plans which allow subscribers to adjust monthly their data limits and which include unlimited data plan choices. B2B mobile revenues accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the past three years we have been the fastest-growing B2B mobile operator in the Dutch telecommunications market as measured by net adds. For SMB and LE/CE customers, fixed internet services are currently offered under the Tele2 brand while SOHO/VSE customers are currently offered fixed internet services under the T-Mobile brand. _Other_ We have also entered into several wholesale agreements for the sale of certain services, such as Ethernet connections or access to our mobile radio networks, to other providers of mobile and fixed telecommunications services. These services are consolidated in the Other segment, which constituted 6.9% and 3.6% of our total company revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

The Magenta footprint of our fixed internet service offers fiber internet through an ODF access as a result of several agreements and partnerships. We have agreements with Reggefiber Operator B.V., a member of the KPN group, to provide ODF access to their fiber network, which currently extends to 2 million homes passed as of September 30, 2021. Either party under certain conditions may terminate these agreements, including the condition that they may be terminated by Reggefiber Operator B.V. with two years’ notice if Reggefiber Operator B.V. is no longer required by law or regulation to provide access to its fiber grid. We also have an exclusive agreement to be the anchor tenant of Open Dutch Fiber, a joint venture between KKR and Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, which aims to deploy to one million homes passed by 2025, mainly in dense urban areas with no targeted overbuild of existing FTTH. Finally, we have an agreement with Primevest Capital Partners according to which we will serve as an anchor tenant on a FTTH, very high speed internet network that Primevest Capital Partners and their construction partner, VolkerWessels, will build. Following the pilot in The Hague’s Segbroek area, this joint venture will build or has already built fiber networks in The Hague’s Loosduinen area as well as Eindhoven and Rotterdam. This network is expected to extend to over 130,000 homes passed by mid-2022. Under the terms of both of these agreements we are obligated to maintain certain utilization rates which we expect to be able to maintain. Most of the remainder of our nationwide fixed internet footprint currently relies upon KPN providing us with WBA, MDF, ODF and VULA, whether through agreements that we have made with KPN and its affiliates or through legacy contracts that we have inherited upon acquiring Tele2. This involves wholesale broadband access by means of virtual unbundled local access under an open wholesale model.

Our main sales channels are the following: - Exclusive retail stores: we currently operate 124 retail stores across The Netherlands, with a slightly higher concentration in the _Randstad, the metropolitan area comprising Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague. As of March 31, 2021, we operated these shops with an average of 3.9 FTE per shop. In addition to providing for sales of traditional mobile offerings, the stores represent an opportunity to market fixed broadband and bundled packages. We rent all shop buildings from third parties and have incorporated our retail business in a separate legal entity, TMobile Netherlands Retail. - Indirect sales: we leverage relationships with key telecommunications partners to sell T-Mobile-, Tele2- and Ben-branded products both online and through several offline resellers with presence in more than 500 stores nationwide. Additionally, in fiber roll-out areas, we engage door-to-door partners to sell T-Mobile Thuis-branded fixed internet. ----- - Online sales: we have prioritized the growth of our online sales channel, which benefits from lower costs than brick-and-mortar storefront. We reached a high benchmark in online sales, with approximately 46% of overall sales implemented through digital channels in 2020, excluding our indirect online sales. Each brand has its own brand-specific website and a dedicated digital marketing strategy supported by big data platforms to optimize media investment, traffic and conversion rates. Simpel’s online sales channel represents its only platform for customer interaction. - Telesales: we sell our products and services by telephone through our own and third-party call centers, using both active direct to consumer telephone marketing and passive advertising in print, online and television media. Our telesales channel not only focuses on customer retention but also serves as important up-selling and cross-selling routes, as into fixed or FMC packages. _B2B segment_ In our B2B segment, we take a differentiated approach to sales with a focus on maximizing growth while optimizing cost to sell. At the SOHO/VSE level, we employ multiple distribution channels, including telesales, our retail shops, online sales through our B2B web shop and sales through retail partners.

Services under the Ben brand are mostly based on the Magenta BSS systems but with independent sales systems and customer relationship management provided by SugarCRM. The Simpel brand features a fully outsourced, standalone BSS environment, while a legacy Tele2 BSS is maintained by Cognizant and services a small number of LE/CE customers. We rely on Atos, Wipro and Netcracker for application development and maintenance services as well as, in the case of Atos and Wipro, infrastructure delivery and management on Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, as well as other related services. Wipro also provides our external 24x7 IT service desk. Salesforce provides us its customer relationship management system. Our IT infrastructure is based on a hybrid architecture deployed in private and public clouds and houses a large number of applications for our business units and customers. We operate on a “cloud first” principle such that new workloads are deployed to the public cloud by default, and more than 90% of the Magenta BSS has been migrated to the cloud. However, in recognizing that not all IT workloads are cloud-ready, we migrate our applications to the public or private cloud based on the requirements of our business technology, taking into account our security-by-design framework, which aims to guarantee the security of our applications and our compliance with relevant regulations. All personnel involved in software development activities are required to follow an obligatory security awareness and security-by-design e-learning.

The proceedings initiated against us may include, among others, the following categories of claims: claims by or on behalf of customers on grounds such as alleged misrepresentation, breach of service or license terms, breach of telecommunications, consumer, health, privacy and unauthorized access and safety regulations, or intellectual property claims primarily relating to alleged copyright infringement brought by copyright collection entities; claims by suppliers and other telecommunications providers, including telecommunications providers who use our network pursuant to wholesale services arrangements; claims by employees; claims by tax authorities with respect to tax matters such as VAT, transfer taxes and property tax; and claims by other administrative bodies or agencies such as claims for breach of data protection or consumer protection regulations. In line with an agreement we made with Dutch tax authorities in the past, we currently do not charge VAT over disconnection fees. The Dutch tax authorities are having an internal discussion to determine their view in this matter. The Dutch tax authorities may challenge our view that the disconnection fees are not subject to VAT. Any such action may have material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, we are currently being investigated by the AT, in joint cooperation with the AP, regarding alleged breaches of data protection and telecommunications laws in connection with our sharing certain aggregated and anonymized customer location data with CBS under a partnership with CBS that has since terminated. If it finds against us, the AT could impose a fine of up to €900,000. For more information about the AT investigation, see “Risk Factors—We face risks arising from the outcome of various criminal, _civil, administrative and regulatory proceedings.”_ Prior to changing our debt collection processes and agencies in the first quarter of 2020, we sold customer invoice receivables to Direct Pay, who, as of September 30, 2021, continues to owe us €4.3 million under our agreement with them, which we have currently provisioned as bad debt. However, Direct Pay has submitted claims to us in the aggregate amount of €7.5 million, first, that we have not provided sufficient documentation regarding customer contracts and invoices, and second, that it lost profits due to unforeseen ----- changes in the regulatory environment that diminished its ability to collect on the debts, and that we should share the burden of such alleged lost profits. We discussed the matter with Direct Pay in the course of the third quarter of 2021 but have been unable to resolve the dispute amicably thus far. We or Direct Pay may initiate legal proceedings if we are not able to resolve this matter. Further, we have been involved in litigation involving our prior and discontinued offer of ‘free handsets’ to consumers along with mobile subscriptions, referred to as ‘all-in subscriptions.’ In 2014 and 2016, the Supreme Court of The Netherlands gave interlocutory decisions in which it concluded that such offerings were not compliant with statutory provisions on installment purchases, credit transactions and credit agreements. We had voluntarily stopped offering such all-in subscriptions on September 9, 2014 for direct sales and January 18, 2015 for indirect sales. Tele2, which we subsequently acquired, also offered all-in subscriptions and stopped offering them on September 1, 2014. Subsequently, multiple claims vehicles and foundations have solicited individuals to initiate mass claims against telecommunications providers who offered all-in subscriptions. We have been in contact with several vehicles and foundations in order to reach a settlement and have reached a settlement with Consumentenbond and ConsumentenClaim in October 2020 in particular regarding the period and type of mobile subscription eligible for compensation as well as the calculation method for the amount of compensation per customer. We have finalized processing claims under this settlement. However, this settlement does not cover claims submitted by other claims vehicles and foundations. For instance, we are in settlement discussions with MobiClaim in particular regarding potential claims on the same matter from claimants who are not party to any settlements thus far, and ConTel approached us in mid-2021 to express a willingness to pursue certain claims that have been pending since 2016. Such negotiations may fail and it is possible that MobiClaim or ConTel will initiate legal proceedings. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are not aware of any other legal, administrative, judicial, regulatory, tax or arbitral proceedings or investigations (including any pending or threatened proceedings or investigations) that are likely to have, or have had, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of legal proceedings and investigations, however, can be extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we can offer no assurances in this regard.

Wholesale access to KPN’s fixed network was previously regulated by the ACM based on “significant market power” (“SMP”) provisions in the Dutch Telecommunications Act. As a result of a March 2020 decision by the CBb, no such SMP provisions apply and KPN is no longer required to provide access to its copper and fiber networks. As we can no longer rely on the former regulatory framework, KPN and its affiliates could potentially charge prices for access without regulatory restriction or deny us access. At the moment we are largely protected against price increases for the wholesale access services we purchase from KPN and their affiliates by the terms of the contracts that we have concluded with them, with the exception of our contracts for MDF access, where we lack such price protection. At our request, the ACM is reviewing ways of restoring regulation to KPN’s fiber network through SMP or through competent authorities’ ability to impose symmetric regulation as provided for in the European Electronic Communications Code.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.84,Regulatory framework—Regulation of electronic communication services,17.84.1,Summary of European regulation,"In the last eighteen (18) years, the telecommunications market in the European Union has been gradually deregulated. In March 2002, the European Union approved a new regulatory framework for electronic communications (the “RF” or “regulatory framework”), in order to adopt a harmonized regulatory framework among the Member States. The RF was originally composed of five directives (the “Directives”): - _Framework directive: a common regulatory framework for electronic communication networks and services that establishes the general principles of the RF, as well as the procedure that should be followed by national regulating authorities to impose _ex ante obligations on operators with significant market power (“SMP”). - _Universal service directive: this regulates the universal service and the rights of users of communication networks and services. - _Access directive: this regulates access to electronic communication networks and their interconnection. - _Authorization directive: this regulates the authorization of communication networks and services; and - _Directive on privacy and electronic communications: this regulates the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in electronic communications. This regulatory framework also includes three key elements: - a recommendation from the European Commission on important markets subject to _ex ante regulation (the “Market Recommendation”); - guidelines on market analysis and the assessment of SMP (the “Guidelines”); and - the decision on a regulatory framework for the radio-electric spectrum. In November 2009, the regulatory package on electronic communications was revised in a process that took two years, with the involvement of the European Commission, Parliament and Council. The main change consisted of the increase in the powers of the Commission to coordinate the use of the radio-electric spectrum, and the Commission was also granted greater powers regarding the obligations that national regulatory ----- authorities could impose on operators with significant market power, specifically when these could create barriers to the single market or violate EU legislation. The revised directives also contain a set of provisions relating to new generation networks, consumer rights and (as an exceptional measure) the functional separation of vertically-integrated companies. This measure is adopted when the regulatory authority concludes that the obligations imposed by national regulatory authorities on operators with significant market power in accordance with applicable legislation have not produced effective competition and there are major, persistent competition problems and/or market risks related to the wholesale provision of certain access markets. In 2007, a new market recommendation was adopted by the Commission, repealing and replacing the previous 2003 Market Recommendation, by virtue of which the markets potentially subject to ex ante regulation were reduced from eighteen to seven . This reduction included most retail markets, mobile network access markets and the broadcast market. In November 2009, the European Parliament and the Regulation of the European Council created the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (the “BEREC”), a European body of national regulatory authorities that acts as a consultative committee of the European Commission. The BEREC began its activities in January 2010. The regulatory framework applicable to this body was changed by European Regulations on December 11, 2018. Since then, the European Commission has updated its recommendation for markets in the 2014 Market Recommendation, removing the fixed access retail markets and wholesale rented lines with the markets subject to ex ante regulation being reduced to four. Specifically, termination markets on fixed and mobile networks (markets 1 and 2, respectively) and the access market to broadband in its residential and business sectors (markets 3a, 3b and 4) were retained. Subsequently in 2020 the European Commission adopted a new Recommendation (2020/2245) on relevant markets, reducing its remaining defined markets to a market for wholesale local access provided at a fixed location (now market 1) and wholesale dedicated capacity (now market 2). The recommendation became effective on December 21, 2020. It has also adopted measures aimed at promoting the development of broadband, through the adoption of: (i) recommendations in 2010 and 2013 promoting greater harmonization and effectiveness of corrective measures for NRAs (national regulatory authorities) concerning operators with significant market power with access to NGNs (new generation networks); (ii) a European Directive to facilitate the roll-out of networks, and (iii) a new commission decision on the spectrum of the following frequencies: 790-862 MHz, 880-915 MHz, 925-960 MHz, 1,710-1,785 MHz, 1,805-1,880 MHz, 1,900 -1,980 MHz, 2,010 – 2,025 MHz, 2,110– 2,170 MHz, 2.5 -2.69 GHz, and 3.4-3.8 GHz. On July 1, 2012 Regulation (EU) No. 531/2012 on public communications networks in the EU entered into force, with the ultimate aim of removing the differences between international roaming tariffs (the “Regulation 531/2012”) by establishing an internal market for communication services. This regulation makes it possible for: - mobile operators to use the networks of other operators in Member States at regulated wholesale prices; and - clients to use voice, SMS and data services from an alternative service provider without changing their telephone, telephone number or SIM card. The application of regulation 531/2012 started on July 1, 2014. On June 30, 2015, the Commission announced that it had reached a commitment with the European Parliament and the Council to eliminate excess costs for users starting on June 15, 2017 (“RLAH”—roam like at home) and establish the principle of net neutrality on April 30, 2016. In November 2015, Regulation 2015/2120 entered into force, which establishes the measures to safeguard open internet access and among other regulations, modifies Regulation 531/2012 regarding roaming. The principle of net neutrality must ensure that all traffic that circulates through networks receives the same treatment, irrespective of its content, source or destination. Therefore, it prohibits commercial practices that ----- consist of blocking traffic, slowing down speed and discriminating against services. The BEREC guidelines were published on August 30, 2016, detailing the terms of the European Regulation in order to ensure universal internet access with a minimum quality, known as the “best effort.” The 2015/2120 European Regulation foresaw the removal of roaming surcharges from June 2017 and established a maximum price calendar applicable until April 2016 and for the period from April 2016 to June 2017. It also introduced specific restrictions to ensure fair use of the roaming service by users to prevent abuses of such permanent roaming. On December 15, 2016, the European Commission approved the Regulation that details the fair use policy and the methodology to ensure the sustainability of the removal of the roaming surcharge for roaming providers. The BEREC Guidelines concerning the retail roaming market were published on March 27, 2017, updating the 2016 guidelines to include and specify all the provisions introduced by the 2015 Regulations and the European Commission’s 2016 Implementing Regulations. In May 2017, Regulations were approved changing the 2012 roaming Regulations regarding wholesale roaming markets. In February 2021, the European Commission proposed a new Regulation governing roaming, which seeks to extend the RLAH rules and inter alia improve service levels when roaming. The new Regulation is still subject to the European Union legislative process and may therefore be modified before entering into force. For example, a European Parliament Committee has voted to reduce wholesale roaming fees charged between operators. Until a final Regulation enters into force, the exact implications will remain uncertain. In 2013, the EU announced its cyber security strategy, which included a series of measures, among them a newly proposed Directive on network and information systems security. This regulatory proposal would guarantee a reliable information society throughout the EU, where internet providers are also subject to security requirements. This Directive ((EU) no. – 2016/1148)) was definitively adopted in August 2016. In January 2012, the European Commission announced the proposed replacement for Data Protection Directive 95/46/CE with the new General Data Protection Regulation, which is applicable to providers that process personal data in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not. The Regulation was published on May 4, 2016 and became application from May 25, 2018. One of the ten strategic priorities of the European Commission for coming years is the strategy of a digital single market adopted on May 6, 2015 and which approved several initiatives organized into three pillars were approved: (i) better access for consumers and businesses to digital goods and services across Europe; (ii) maximizing the growth potential of the digital economy, and (iii) creating the right conditions and a level playing field for digital networks and innovative services to flourish. This pillar provided for the review of the new telecommunications regulatory framework. Said review led to Directive (EU) No. 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and the Council of December 11, 2018 that established the European Electronic Communications Code. This is a harmonized framework to regulate electronic communication networks, electronic communication services, associated resources and services and some aspects of terminal equipment. The objective of the aforementioned code is to promote competition, encourage investment and strengthen the internal market and consumer rights. In 2016, the Commission also presented an action plan for the roll-out of 5G which provided a common calendar in the EU for its coordinated commercial commissioning in 2020, as well as cooperation between Member States and interested parties in the sector to determine and allocate spectrum bands to 5G, organize 5G pan-European trials starting in 2018, promote worldwide common 5G regulations and encourage the adoption of national plans for the roll-out of 5G in all Member States.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

In particular, Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”) prohibits all agreements between companies, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices, which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the European Union. Article 102 of the TFEU prohibits the abuse by one or more companies of a dominant position within the internal market or a substantial part of it. Article 107 of the TFEU prohibits all aid provided by a Member State or through state resources that falsifies or ----- threatens to falsify competition, by favoring specific companies or the production of specific products that affect trade between Member States. Finally, EU Regulations on merger control demand that all mergers and acquisitions that exceed specific turnover thresholds are notified to the European Commission for their review, and not to the national competition authorities. The regulations prohibit mergers if they affect real competition within the internal market or a substantial part of it, particularly as a consequence of the creation of strengthening of a dominant position in the market. Both the European Commission and the national competition authorities and courts have to apply European legislation on competition (although only the European Commission has the authority to apply the law relating to state aid). In addition, there are similar competition regulations in the national legislation of each state, and national and regional competition authorities and courts have the authority to oversee compliance with these regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.84,Regulatory framework—Regulation of electronic communication services,17.84.3,National regulatory authorities in The Netherlands,"_Overview_ The video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated at the EU level. In The Netherlands, these regulations are implemented through the Telecommunicatiewet (the Dutch Telecommunications Act, “DTA”), the Mediawet (the Dutch Media Act, “DMA”), the Wet beveiliging _network en informatiesystemen (the Network and Information Systems Security Act, “NNIS”) and related_ legislation and regulations. The ACM in which the former Independent Post and Telecommunications Authority (“OPTA,” _Onafhankelijke Post en Telecommunicatie Autoriteit) as well as the former Dutch Competition Authority (“NMa,” _Nederlandse Mededingings autoriteit) have been integrated, and the Dutch Radiocommunications Agency (“AT,” _Agentschap Telecom) supervise and enforce compliance with certain parts of the DTA. Pursuant to the DTA, the ACM is designated as a National Regulatory Authority (NRA). The Dutch Media Authority (“CvdM,” Commissariaat voor de Media) is authorized to enforce compliance with the DMA. The AT is authorized to enforce the NISS with regard to network and information system providers and any mandatory notifications of cybersecurity incidents have to be made to The Netherlands National Cyber Security Center (“NCSC,” _Nationaal Cyber Security Centrum). The Privacy Authority (“AP”) (Autoriteit _Persoonsgegevens) supervises and enforces compliance with privacy legislation._ In addition to complying with industry specific regimes, we must comply with both specific and general legislation concerning, among other areas, competition, data protection, data retention, cyber security, internet service provider liability, consumer protection, and e-commerce. The DTA comprises a wide variety of rights and obligations relevant to the provision of public electronic communications networks and services. Certain key provisions included in the DTA are described below, but this description is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all regulations in this area. _Licensing_ The DTA contains a system of general authorizations and provides a possibility to charge supervision costs, generally based on a percentage of the generated revenues or in case of certain specific activities a fixed fee applied for the activity conducted by ACM. A provider of a public electronic communications network or service needs to notify the ACM of its network or service, who will register the notification. The purpose of the notification is to increase transparency and to ensure effective regulation and does not constitute a formal condition for market entry. With regard to scarce resources such as telephone numbers and frequencies, a system of (individual) licensing or allocation by the ACM applies. The ACM, on request, administers telephone number allocation in line with the national phone number plan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, including through AT, administers the frequency spectrum (including auction processes and supervision) and grants licenses with regard to the use of frequencies. Licenses for frequencies are issued upon application, either on a first-come-first-serve basis, beauty contest or auction. A frequency license confers the right to use a specific set of frequencies in a specific band for a specific period of time and under specific conditions, such as coverage obligations. Frequency licenses are transferable with permission from the Minister of Economic Affairs. In addition to one-off license fees, holders of licenses have to pay annual supervision costs, based on the amount of spectrum held. We hold licenses in the 700, 800, 900, 1,400, 1,800, 2,100, and 2,600 MHz bands to provide 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G communications in The Netherlands. In 2020, we acquired new licenses in the 700 MHz, 1,400 MHz band and ----- were able to re-acquire licenses in the 2,100 MHz bands, all for a period of 20 years. The other licenses will expire in 2030. The Dutch Government is planning to auction 300 MHz in the 3.5 GHz band, which due to delays is presently expected to occur in the second half of 2022, but could be delayed even further. As of December 31, 2020, we hold approximately 38% of the total mobile spectrum licenses in The Netherlands, which are used to deliver mobile services. _Access, Interoperability and Interconnection_ All providers of public electronic communications networks or services who control access to endusers are obliged to enter into good-faith negotiations upon the request of a competitor to conclude an interoperability agreement. Interoperability refers to all measures, including network interconnection, which should be implemented to ensure end-to-end connections. Although there is no obligation to reach any specific outcome, if a provider does not comply with its obligation to enter into good-faith negotiations, the ACM, at the other party’s request, can impose proportionate obligations on the provider in order to ensure end-to-end connectivity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Ex ante regulation means that the ACM sets behavioral rules beforehand with which providers who the ACM determines have significant market power must comply. A company will be deemed to have significant market power if, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a market position equivalent to dominance, _i.e., a position of economic strength affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of_ competitors, customers, and ultimately consumers. Before it can be established whether an operator or service provider has significant market power, the ACM needs to determine, in accordance with the principles of general European competition law, in which relevant electronic communications market(s) the operator or service provider competes. The ACM must do this while taking into account the European Commission’s “Recommendation on relevant product and service markets within the electronic communications sector,” the latest version of which was published by the European Commission on December 21, 2020. The ACM may also define additional relevant markets provided that any such market meets the cumulative criteria defined by the European Commission in its so called threecriteria test for determining whether a market is susceptible to ex ante regulation. If the ACM determines that a company has significant market power, the ACM must, subject to appropriateness and proportionality principles, impose one or more obligations. These obligations relate to, among other things, access and use of specific network facilities, non-discrimination, transparency, and price regulation at both the wholesale and retail level, though the framework seeks for obligations to be imposed as much as possible at an upstream (wholesale) level. To ensure a proper functioning of the market, these obligations may not be disproportionate. The investigation of a relevant market, the designation of parties with significant market power and the imposition of _ex ante obligations culminate in so-called market analysis decisions of the ACM. These decisions normally apply for a period of three years, after which the market concerned needs to be re-investigated. Under the EECC this term is extended to five years. The ACM has completed various rounds of market analyses. The Company was designated as a party with significant market power for both the fixed terminating and mobile terminating access markets. The analysis in respect of these markets are discussed below. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

As a result, Former Ziggo (in relation to fixed call termination services) and Vodafone NL (in relation to both fixed and mobile call termination services), have been subject to specific _ex ante obligations, including in particular tariff regulation (maximum termination charges), since the ACM’s third market analysis decision of July 7, 2010. On August 5, 2013, the ACM published its fourth market analysis decision on call termination, which combined both the fixed termination market and the mobile termination market. The new tariffs became effective September 1, 2013, and applied for a three-year period that ended September 1, 2016. The decision was appealed by various operators, including us, and on August 27, 2013, the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court decided in a preliminary decision that the price cap on mobile termination charges should be higher than the ACM had initially determined. The court ruled that the ACM should apply a so-called Bottom-up Long Run Incremental Cost (“BULRIC”) plus cost calculation method (taking into account common overhead costs relating also to other services than mobile call termination, (“BULRIC plus”)) rather than a pure BULRIC method (in which such common overhead costs are to be disregarded, “pure BULRIC”). These revised tariffs applied until the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court arrived at a final decision in the appeal proceedings on the merits (see below). Because the pure BULRIC method used by the ACM is in fact a method recommended by the European Commission in its 2009 Recommendation on the Regulatory Treatment of Termination Rates, the Supreme Administrative Court posed prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice. After an Advocate General opinion, the European Court of Justice ruled on September 15, 2016, that deviation from the European Commission’s 2009 Recommendation on Termination Rates is only possible if justified by national circumstances. The ACM started a new (the fifth) market analysis and published a draft decision on November 18, 2016, in which they again regulate using a pure BULRIC calculation. The hearing at the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court was held on January 11, 2017, and ruling given on July 10, 2017, upheld the ACM’s use of pure BULRIC, though not requesting retroactive adjustment. In April 2017, the ACM provided their plan to impose tariff ceilings of €0.00139 per minute for fixed and €0.005819 per minute for mobile calls from July 1, 2017, to the European Commission. The European Commission approved these in May, 2017. The new tariff implementation was delayed by the court decision, until July 12, 2017. VFZ appealed ACM’s market decision. In September 2018, the appeal court delivered its decision on VFZ’s appeal against the ACM’s Mobile Termination/Fixed-line Termination Rate (“MTR” and “FTR”) regulations market decision. The verdict provides the relevant guidance sought by VFZ about the interpretation and setting of interconnection tariffs among operators. Further to the entry into force of the EECC, the European Commission has adopted a delegated act on December 18, 2020, that will set maximum, EU-wide voice termination rates, both fixed and mobile. These rates will be applicable to any operator providing voice call termination services in the EU. Approval of the delegated act by the European Council and the European Parliament is expected in the course of 2021 and then, after two months, the new rates will apply. The delegated act includes a transition period for the fixed rate that ends on December 31, 2021, and a glide path for the mobile rates that ends on December 31, 2023. On July 21, 2020, ACM has extended the applicability of the rates that the delegated act did not regulate until the new European rates apply.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

ACM referred to this market as the Wholesale Fixed Access (WFA) market and concluded for the first time that KPN and VFZ had joint Significant Market Power. As a result, ACM imposed an obligation on VFZ to offer wholesale cable access and continued wholesale access regulation of KPN. Following a market consultation, ACM submitted the draft decision to the European Commission. After comments by the European Commission, ACM published the final decision on September 28, 2018, which became effective on October 1, 2018. VFZ published a draft Reference Offer on December 31, 2018, and published tariffs on March 31, 2019. In parallel, KPN and VFZ appealed ACM’s decision before the national court seeking annulment, while T-Mobile and Tele2 appealed with the intent to ----- secure more stringent regulation. VFZ also initiated an action before the European General Court related to the European Commission’s response to the consultation. The national appeal turned out successful: on March 17, 2020, the Court annulled ACM’s decision. With Court’s verdict being final, VFZ is no longer obligated to offer cable access and has since withdrawn its reference offer. Also, KPN is no longer obligated to offer regulated access. On July 9, 2021, the ACM indicated in a press release that it is again investigating fixed access, because KPN’s access conditions may make it more difficult for competitors to compete, which may in the future lead to higher prices for consumers and companies, and lower uptake of high-speed internet. In its press release the ACM indicated that it intends to publish a new draft market analysis decision in the fall of 2021, which has not yet been done.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.84,Regulatory framework—Regulation of electronic communication services,17.84.8,Symmetrical access,"The DTA is undergoing revision to fully implement the European Electronic Communications Code and has already been revised to contain provisions enabling the ACM to impose obligations inter alia to grant access to infrastructure within buildings or up to the first concentration or distribution point of the network. For this to occur it is necessary that replication is economically inefficient or physically impracticable. Moreover, should this kind of access be insufficient to overcome high and non-transitory barriers to replication within the context of a market situation significantly limiting competitive outcomes for end users, the ACM will be able to impose obligations beyond the first concentration or distribution point of the network. The ACM has not yet made use of these new powers, and it remains to be seen if and how exactly they will be applied, however it is likely that the ACM in doing so will take into account BEREC’s December 2020 Guidelines on the Criteria for a Consistent Application of Article 61 (3) EECC. Nevertheless, they could become an alternative or addition to its powers under the significant market power regime described below. A key difference is that for these symmetrical access provisions to be applied, the ACM will not need to demonstrate the existence of such significant market power (but rather replicability issues and, for access beyond the first concentration or distribution point, a market situation significantly limiting competition outcomes for consumers). We have requested the ACM to make use of its new powers and impose symmetrical access ACM is currently prioritizing its market analysis decision process to impose access regulation on the basis of market dominance. The timing of a decision based on the new powers granted to ACM under the symmetric access regulation is therefore unclear.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

We are required to notify the AT in case of disturbances, which materially threaten the continuity of our networks and services, and the National Cyber Security Center (“NCSC”) in case of security and integrity breaches caused by cyberattacks, which could lead to disturbance of the continuity. To mitigate the risks to continuity of mobile services, T-Mobile, Vodafone NL, and KPN voluntarily entered into national roaming arrangements in 2014, allowing for their respective subscribers to roam (voice and SMS) on the other parties’ networks in the event of local outages of mobile networks where the outage is foreseen to last for more than three days and affect over 500,000 customers. Acquisitions of control in telecommunications companies (such as ourselves, or companies we may wish to acquire) may be subject to a notification requirement and investigation from the perspective whether the acquisition poses a threat to the public interest, with the worst possible outcome being a prohibition of the acquisition. In October 2021, additional rules (Regeling veiligheid en integriteit telecommunicatie) were published aiming to protect critical network elements, adjacent elements, security elements and control environments. The rules include specifications for implementation, and are categorized as follows: (i) safe configuration of technical equipment, (ii) safe configuration of networks, (iii) guarding of technical infrastructure, (iv) security assurance for software and control services, and (v) human resource security.

On May 25, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which replaced the European Data Protection Directive, came into force. The GDPR has direct effect in The Netherlands with additional data protection obligations relevant to our operations that include: (i) clear explanation and transparency of personal data usage to customers and employees, and maintaining an internal data processing register, (ii) affirmative consent from users for profiling by automated means, (iii) stronger privacy rights for users and (iv) application of privacy by design/default to data processes. In addition to the general data protection framework of the GDPR, the DTA sets out specific regulations for providers of public electronic communications networks and services. These regulations include an obligation to offer certain technical facilities, such as specification of invoices, telephone number identification and transfer of calls, rules regarding the use and processing of location data and traffic data (i.e., call detail records), an obligation to provide access to subscriber lists for directory services, obligations to implement security measures to protect personal data and rules regarding unsolicited commercial communications (“spam”). The DTA also obliges providers of public electronic communications networks to notify the AT in case of a security breach or major outage. If this includes the leakage of personal data processed by the provider, the AP needs to be informed as well. On January 10, 2017, a draft ePrivacy Regulation (“ePR”) was proposed by the European Commission to replace the ePrivacy Directive. On February 10, 2021, the Council reached an agreement on their position on the ePR and negotiations are ongoing.

These provisions regulate net neutrality by, among other things, prohibiting operators of public telecommunication networks through which internet access is provided as well as internet service providers from blocking or restricting services or applications which are accessed via the internet other than in circumstances set forth in the DTA. In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted a new Regulation including the first EU-wide net neutrality regime. Following a lengthy legislative procedure, the regulation (directly applicable in all Member States from April 30, 2016) reflects a light-handed approach to net neutrality permitting the provision of specialized services optimized for specific content and approving reasonable traffic management. In October 2016, a bill to change the DTA pursuant to the EU net neutrality Regulation was adopted by the Dutch Senate. In the law, a specific obligation prohibiting tariff differentiation for data was maintained, which however did not follow from the Regulation. The Court in Rotterdam ruled on April 20, ----- 2017, that the Dutch ban on zero rating for data is not valid as the EU net neutrality Regulation does not allow further national regulation on this issue. Also the net neutrality regulation did not contain a prohibition of any form of zero-rating. Therefore, the Dutch law was conflicting with the EU net neutrality regulation and had to be set aside. As a result, the DTA was amended to properly reflect the EU regulation. The special interest group Bits of Freedom has brought a series of legal challenges aimed at prohibiting zero rating, all of which were unsuccessful. BEREC is currently reviewing zero rating as a result of a decision of the European Court of Justice from September 2, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Providers of digital program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers are subject to the obligation to provide at least 30 television channels, including six public television broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation, a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting channels and a number of digital radio broadcasting channels. In addition, all providers of analogue program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers must include at least 15 television channels, including five public broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation, a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting channels and some analogue radio broadcasting channels.

Before the SSN Escrowed Property may be removed from the SSN Escrow Account (the “Release”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must determine, on or before the Longstop Date, that: (1)(i) the Acquisition ----- will be consummated promptly following the release of the SSN Escrowed Property and (ii) no material term or condition of the Acquisition Agreement has been amended or waived in a manner or to an extent that would be materially prejudicial to the interests of Holders, other than any amendment or waiver made with the consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes (provided that if the Majority Lenders, as defined in, and pursuant to the Senior Facilities Agreement shall have consented to any such amendment or waiver (or the senior facilities are drawn without any such consent being required) then the consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes shall be deemed to have been granted to such amendment or waiver) and (2) as of the Release Date (defined below), there are no events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. The Release will occur as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination described above (the date of such determination, the “Release Date”). Upon the Release, the SSN Escrowed Property will be paid out of the SSN Escrow Account in accordance with the SSN Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the SSN Escrow Account will be reduced to zero.

On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes and shall be entitled to use the SSN Escrowed Property to make such payments. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. The SSN Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the SSN Escrowed Property, the shareholder of the Parent will be required to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the SSN Escrowed Property, pursuant to a commitment provided by such shareholder (the “SSN Escrow Equity Commitment”). The holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the SSN Escrow Equity Commitment, and must rely on the Senior Secured Issuer’s rights to enforcement under the SSN Escrow Equity Commitment. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, and may transfer any portion of the SSN Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed a Release, provided the Senior Secured Notes Issuer provides a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original SSN Escrow Account and provided that use and/or release of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original SSN Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which SSN Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be a SSN Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall ----- constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the SSN Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account.

The Guarantors will grant the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and will also, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, guarantee the Senior Facilities Agreement on a senior secured, pari passu basis. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the expected Target Guarantors will be the Target and TMobile Netherlands B.V.). For the year ended December 31, 2020, on an unconsolidated basis and without giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other adjustments in relation to consolidation, the Target Guarantors (expected to be the Target and T-Mobile Netherlands) represented (i) 92.1% of the Target Group’s net revenue and (ii) 94.3% of the Target Group’s EBITDA. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, on an unconsolidated basis and without giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other adjustments in relation to consolidation, the Target Guarantors represented (i) 90.3% of the Target Group’s net revenue, and (ii) 103.0% of the Target’s Group EBITDA, which is higher than the consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group for nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to negative EBITDA of some of non-Target Guarantor entities for this period. As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, after giving effect to intercompany eliminations attributable to share capital but not to other adjustments in relation to consolidation, the Target Guarantors represented 117.0% and 130.0%, respectively, of the Target Group’s total assets, which are higher than the consolidated total assets of the Target Group for the relevant periods due to the negative value of total assets at some of the non-Target Guarantor entities as a result of intercompany position relating to operations of these entities with the Target Guarantors, whereby, prior to consolidation, their liabilities exceed their assets. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Senior _Secured Notes Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior Secured Notes_ Guarantee in the future. The term “Senior Secured Notes Guarantees” or “Guarantors” shall also be deemed to refer to any such future additional Guarantee or Guarantees that may be granted from time to time in accordance with the Indenture. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among others, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, justified corporate interest (where applicable), fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters. See “—Security—Summary of Agreed Security Principles.” Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See “Certain Insolvency Law ----- _Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and Security—Insolvency Law Considerations—The Netherlands—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests.”_ The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company, and, therefore, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be dependent on cash flows from intercompany loans or other payments or distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. The Parent, which is the direct parent company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, is also a holding company which was also formed for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions and has no revenue generating operations of its own and no material assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to _the Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The Issuers are holding companies that do not have any revenue generating operations of their own and depend on cash from operating companies to be able to make payments on the Notes.”_ Not all of the subsidiaries of the Target will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including the Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Parent.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by compliance therewith. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will mail a notice of the Change of Control Offer to each Holder of any such Senior Secured Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and ----- (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Parent will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer . Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event may require prepayment and cancellation or other consequences in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions on, or entail consequences arising from, certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the_ Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the ----- Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and the decision whether to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above will in such circumstance be made in the good faith judgment of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the SN Escrow Agreement and the SN Escrow Charge. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—The Acquisition is subject to certain _conditions and risks and, if it is not consummated, on or prior to the Longstop Date, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any.”_ The SN Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from the SN Escrow Account, upon instruction of the Senior Notes Issuer, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the Release (as defined below) in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Senior Notes under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the SN Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the SN Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the SN Escrowed Property. Before the SN Escrowed Property may be removed from the SN Escrow Account (the “Release”), the Senior Notes Issuer must determine, on or before the Longstop Date, that: (1)(i) the Acquisition will be consummated promptly following the release of the SN Escrowed Property and (ii) no material term or condition of the Acquisition Agreement has been amended or waived in a manner or to an extent that would be materially prejudicial to the interests of Holders, other than any amendment or waiver made with the consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding Senior Notes (provided that if the Majority Lenders, as defined in, ----- and pursuant to the Senior Facilities Agreement shall have consented to any such amendment or waiver (or the senior facilities are drawn without any such consent being required) then the consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding Senior Notes shall be deemed to have been granted to such amendment or waiver) and (2) as of the Release Date (defined below), there are no events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer. The Release will occur as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination described above (the date of such determination, the “Release Date”). Upon the Release, the SN Escrowed Property will be paid out of the SN Escrow Account in accordance with the SN Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the SN Escrow Account will be reduced to zero. In the event that (i) Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Longstop Date, (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Longstop Date, (iii) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Longstop Date or (iv) there is there an event of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection (as set out in clause (6) under “—Events of _Default”) with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer on or prior to the Longstop Date (the date of any such event_ being the “Special Termination Date”), the Senior Notes Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Senior Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. The SN Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Senior Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the SN Escrowed Property, the shareholder of the Parent will be required to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the SN Escrowed Property, pursuant to a commitment provided by such shareholder (the “SN Escrow Equity Commitment”). The holders of the Senior Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the SN Escrow Equity Commitment, and must rely on the Senior Issuer’s rights to enforcement under the SN Escrow Equity Commitment. The Senior Notes Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, and may transfer any portion of the SN Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed an Escrow Release; provided that the Company provides a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and provided further that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which SN Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Company of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the SN Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account. If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Authority that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such special mandatory redemption. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

The",61.17.1,,"Guarantors will grant the Senior Notes Guarantees and will also, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, guarantee the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Secured Notes on a senior secured basis. Each of the Senior Notes Guarantees is a senior subordinated Guarantee, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, each such Senior Notes Guarantee ranks behind, and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor, including any obligations owed by the relevant Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement and any secured hedging. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors under their Senior Notes Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Senior Notes Guarantees, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” Because of the subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) of a Guarantor would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Senior Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such Guarantor. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Senior Notes. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the expected Target Guarantors will be the Target and TMobile Netherlands B.V.). For the year ended December 31, 2020, on an unconsolidated basis and without giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other adjustments in relation to consolidation, the Target Guarantors (expected to be the Target and T-Mobile Netherlands) represented (i) 92.1% of the Target Group’s net revenue and (ii) 94.3% of the Target Group’s EBITDA. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, on an unconsolidated basis and without giving effect to intercompany eliminations and other adjustments in relation to consolidation, the Target Guarantors represented (i) 90.3% of the Target Group’s net revenue, and (ii) 103.0% of the Target’s Group EBITDA, which is higher than the consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group for nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to negative EBITDA of some of non-Target Guarantor entities for this period. As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, after giving effect to intercompany eliminations attributable to share capital but not to other adjustments in relation to consolidation, the Target Guarantors represented 117.0% and 130.0%, respectively, of the Target Group’s total assets, which are higher than the consolidated total assets of the Target Group for the relevant periods due to the negative value of total assets at some of the non-Target Guarantor entities as a result of intercompany position relating to operations of these entities with the Target Guarantors, whereby, prior to consolidation, their liabilities exceed their assets. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Senior _Notes Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior Notes Guarantee in the future._ The term “Senior Notes Guarantees” or “Guarantors” shall also be deemed to refer to any such future additional Guarantee or Guarantees that may be granted from time to time in accordance with the Indenture. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among others, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, justified corporate interest (where applicable), fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters. See “—Security—Summary of Agreed Security Principles.” Each Senior Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United ----- States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees _and Security—Insolvency Law Considerations—The Netherlands—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests.”_ The Senior Notes Issuer is a holding company, and, therefore, the Senior Notes Issuer will be dependent on cash flows from intercompany loans or other payments or distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our _Indebtedness and Financial Information—The Issuers are holding companies that do not have any revenue generating operations of their own and depend on cash from operating companies to be able to make payments on the Notes.”_ Not all of the subsidiaries of the Target will guarantee the Senior Notes. Claims of creditors of nonguarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including the Holders. The Senior Notes and each Senior Notes Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Parent. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Financial Information—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.”_ The Senior Notes Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate and be released: (1) upon the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of ownership interests in the relevant Guarantor (directly or through a Holding Company of such Guarantor) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate the Indenture; (2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; (3) upon defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; (4) as described in the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants— _Additional Senior Notes Guarantees”;_ (5) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below); (6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”; (7) with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “Certain Covenants—Merger and _Consolidation” and the Indenture;_ (8) with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor; (9) in the case of any Guarantor that is a Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, pursuant to the provisions described below under “—IPO Pushdown”; or ----- (10) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes. At the request and expense of the Senior Notes Issuer and, if applicable, at the request of the Security Agent, the Trustee shall take all reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release or amendment of a Senior Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions. Each of the releases and amendments set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without any consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes, and potentially other future Indebtedness, on a first-ranking basis, ahead of any claims of the Senior Notes. The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Senior Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral.

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any Operating Facilities (as defined and designated pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement), and certain hedging agreements. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the Parent is permitted to_ grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, including on a basis prior to the Senior Notes. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral will be applied first to discharge obligations that are secured over the Collateral on a priority basis, including but not limited to the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes, and thereafter pro rata in payment of all liabilities in respect of obligations under the indenture and the Senior Notes and any other Indebtedness of the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. In the future, pursuant to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and/or counterparties to certain hedging agreements and any Senior Secured Notes may also benefit from security which does not secure the Senior Notes offered hereby. The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law or before courts in certain of these jurisdictions. The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the rights of the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf or on behalf of the Holders) to take enforcement action under the Security Documents with respect to the Collateral are subject to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement.”_ The ability of holders of the Senior Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Senior Notes Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee. See “—The Senior Notes Guarantees,” “Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations and Limitations on Notes Guarantees and Security” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Dutch insolvency laws may provide you with less protection than bankruptcy laws of other jurisdictions you are familiar with.”_ Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and any other Collateral provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes.

Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than ten days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by compliance therewith. The Senior Notes Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Unless the Senior Notes Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Notes Issuer will mail a notice of the Change of Control Offer to each Holder of any such Senior Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event; (4) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Notes Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Notes repurchased; and ----- (5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Senior Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Notes Issuer. If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Parent will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer . Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event may require prepayment and cancellation or other consequences in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions on, or entail consequences arising from, certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Notes Issuer. The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Senior Notes Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the_ Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not ----- contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and the decision whether to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above will in such circumstance be made in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among others, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and/or Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear and/or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan. When considering an investment in the Notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code, and may result in the disqualification of an IRA. In addition, the fiduciary of the Plan that engaged in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which an Issuer, a Guarantor, an Initial Purchaser or certain of their respective affiliates is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. Included among these statutory exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code, which exempt certain transactions (including, without limitation, a sale and purchase of securities) between a Covered Plan and a party in interest so long as (i) such party in interest is treated as such solely by reason of providing services to the Covered Plan, (ii) such party in interest is not a fiduciary which renders investment advice, or has or exercises discretionary authority or control, with respect to the assets of the Covered Plan involved in such transaction, or an affiliate of any such person and (iii) the Covered Plan neither receives less than nor pays more than “adequate consideration” (as defined in such Sections) in connection with such transaction. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on these ----- or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption in consultation with its legal advisers to assure the exemption is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Plans that are government plans, foreign plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws.

A qualifying interest is an interest that allows the holder to have a decisive influence over the other party’s decisions, in such a way that it is able to determine the activities of the other party.

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person for United States federal income tax purposes. If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Notes, you should consult your tax advisors. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including, without limitation: - a broker or dealer in securities or currencies; - a financial institution; - a regulated investment company; - a real estate investment trust; - a tax-exempt organization; - an insurance company; - a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle; - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting; ----- - a partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement (or an investor in such an entity or arrangement); - an accrual method taxpayer required to recognize income for United States federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is taken into account in applicable financial statements; - a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or - a United States expatriate. This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions in effect as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are different from those discussed below. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, the alternative minimum tax or the effects of United States federal tax laws other than income tax laws or of any state, local or non-United States tax laws.

A pushdown in relation to an IPO Event (as described in “Description of the Senior,"_Secured Notes—IPO Pushdown” and “Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Pushdown”) could result in a_ taxable exchange of the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes, in which case you may recognize gain or loss on the Notes (although any such loss may be disallowed) at such time equal to the difference, if any, between the issue price of the deemed newly issued Notes (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) and your adjusted tax basis in the Notes, and have a new holding period and tax basis in the Notes. Any such gain or loss would be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement, _Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes.” If the fair market value of the Notes at the time of such_ taxable exchange were lower than their stated principal amount by more than a de minimis amount, the Notes would be treated as newly issued with original issue discount, in which case you may be required to include original issue discount as ordinary income as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) in advance of the receipt of cash.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Note will","generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the Notes (which includes any foreign tax withheld), you will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld. You may be entitled to deduct or credit any foreign withholding tax, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any additional amounts) on a Note will generally be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, will generally be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a United States foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the United States foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the United States foreign tax credit (or deduction in lieu of such credit) under your particular circumstances. It is expected, and the remainder of this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be issued with original issue discount for United States federal income tax purposes. Interest on the Notes will be payable in euro. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest received on the Notes, determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on such date. A cash basis U.S. holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of a payment of interest in euro (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the euro so received). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes or you are otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest on the Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average spot rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate of exchange on: - the last day of the accrual period; - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five (5) business days of the last day of the accrual period. If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt instruments held by you from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollar at such time.

Upon the sale,","exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income as discussed above in “—Payments of Interest”) and your adjusted tax basis in such Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. If you purchased your Note with euro, your U.S. dollar cost will generally be the U.S. dollar ----- value of the euro paid for such Note determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such purchase (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual method taxpayer, the settlement date of the purchase, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable disposition for euro, then your amount realized will generally be based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual method taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). If an accrual method U.S. holder makes the special election to use the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase (in determining its U.S. dollar cost) or disposition (in determining its amount realized) of a Note, the election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss upon the taxable disposition of a Note for euro to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date. Any such exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss. Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of the Note will generally be treated as exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss realized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note, and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual method taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). The amount of exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on such disposition of the Note.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this offering and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale within the United States of Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements for the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer _Restrictions.” The Issuers will apply for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange and to be_ admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. Each Initial Purchaser has also agreed in the Purchase Agreement that it will (to the best of its knowledge and belief) comply with all applicable securities laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers Notes or possesses or distributes this Offering Memorandum, and will obtain any consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer, sale or delivery by it of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force. In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.

Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions.

In the event of insolvency of a Dutch company having its center of main interests in The Netherlands, any insolvency proceedings relating to such company would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law. Under certain circumstances, secondary or territorial bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law against companies that are not established under Dutch law provided that such company has an establishment in The Netherlands. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the ----- debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. _Suspension of payments_ An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder) and often also a supervisory judge (rechter_commissaris). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for suspension of payments, a court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the composition is accepted and subsequently confirmed by a court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension ends as soon as the court’s decision becomes final. The definitive suspension will generally be granted unless (i) a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent, (ii) there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or (iii) there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The requirement of the debtor having to be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that such creditors must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Suspension of payments has retroactive effect from midnight of the day on which the suspension of payments is declared. Furthermore, the suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured nonpreferential creditors. Secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in a suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, pursuant to article 241a Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissmentswet) a court may order a “cooling-off period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (and potentially an additional two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will generally be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority of the recognized and of the admitted creditors present or represented at the meeting representing at least 50% of the amount of the recognized and of the admitted claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by a court. Under certain conditions, a court or supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) (as the case may be) may derogate from this procedure. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. _Bankruptcy_ Bankruptcy can be applied for either by the debtor itself or by a creditor, in each case if the debtor has ceased to pay its debts as they fall due. This is deemed to be the case if the debtor has at least two creditors (at least one of which has a claim that is due and payable and remains unpaid). Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (as described above). Like a suspension of payments, bankruptcy has retroactive effect from midnight of the day on which the bankruptcy is declared. Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a Dutch bankruptcy trustee (curator) and a supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) are appointed. The bankruptcy trustee is charged with the administration and ----- liquidation of the bankruptcy estate and acts under the supervision of the supervisory judge. Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor will be terminated by operation of law and all attachments on the debtor’s assets will be released by operation of law. Legal proceedings to procure payment from the estate that are pending on the date of the bankruptcy order are automatically stayed. The basic principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment) which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, creditors with collateral security (zakelijke zekerheidsrechten) over assets in a bankruptcy estate are able to exercise their rights as if no formal insolvency procedure has occurred and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors (such as, but without limitation, the tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. In general, under Dutch law, rights of mortgage and pledge rank above such other rights of priority, including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, this is subject to exceptions. Under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on machinery and inventory (not including stock (voorraden)) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). In addition, a pledgee is obligated to notify the Dutch tax authorities of (i) its intention to exercise its rights under a pledge on movable property (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken) within the meaning of the Tax Collection Act (Invorderingswet 1990), or (ii) its intention to perform, to procure in any way the performance of, or cooperate with any legal of factual act with respect to such property which could prejudice the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right to such property. Following such notification, a statutory waiting period of up to four weeks starting from the date of notification has to be observed. In the four weeks following such notification, the pledgee may not exercise its security rights in respect of such assets or perform any action with respect to such assets which could prejudice the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right. During this waiting period, the Dutch tax authorities may exercise their priority right in respect of specific property for certain tax debts (bodemvoorrecht). Failure to notify the Dutch tax authorities, or the exercise of its security rights within the aforementioned waiting period in the manner contemplated in subclause (i) or (ii) above, may result in the pledgee having to pay to the Dutch tax authorities an amount equal to the value of the relevant assets or—in the case of an enforcement—the proceeds derived from the enforcement, provided that the amount payable shall not exceed the amount of the relevant taxes due, regardless of whether such taxes have already assessed or not. After the four-week waiting period has lapsed, or upon an earlier notification by the Dutch tax authorities that they will not exercise their priority right, a pledgee may exercise its security rights. However, the pledgee may only exercise such security rights during the four weeks following the lapse of the waiting period, or the date of the notification from the Dutch tax authorities, as the case may be. After the four-week period has ended, the aforementioned limitations are applicable again and the pledgee will only be able to exercise its security rights with respect to such property, after a new notification to the Dutch tax authorities and observance of a new waiting period. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy trustee to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the bankruptcy trustee determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent the claim will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that are due and payable by their terms within one year of the date of the bankruptcy of an Issuer or security grantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. The valuation of claims that would not have been payable within one year from the date of the bankruptcy may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatie vergadering), the bankruptcy trustee, the insolvent debtor and all provisionally verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooi procedure). Such separate court procedures could also cause payments to the holders of the Notes to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. ----- If it is likely that there will be insufficient assets in the bankruptcy estate to distribute to the unsecured creditors, the bankruptcy judge may decide, at the request of the bankruptcy trustee, that it will not be necessary to deal with the unsecured claims and that there will not be a meeting at which claims are admitted or rejected. If the bankruptcy estate is sufficient to make a distribution to unsecured non-preferential creditors, remaining amounts after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the positively verified unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Pursuant to article 138 Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall in general be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a simple majority of the unsecured non-preferential creditors present or represented at the meeting, with admitted and provisionally admitted claims representing at least 50% of the total amount of the admitted and provisionally admitted unsecured non preferential claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Under certain conditions, the supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) may derogate from this procedure. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors in liquidation compositions. Foreign creditors are, in general, not treated differently from creditors that are incorporated or residing in The Netherlands. As mentioned above, secured creditors which have a right in rem (goederenrechtelijke rechten) may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings, the court may order a “cooling-off period” (afkoelingsperiode) on the basis of article 63a Dutch Bankruptcy Act for a maximum of two months during (and potentially an additional two months) which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, the bankruptcy trustee may force a secured creditor to realize its security right by giving the creditor notice to do so within a reasonable time. A failure to take recourse by the creditor will result in the creditor forfeiting its rights to enforce its security rights, albeit that its claim shall continue to be preferred. However, in such an event the creditor must contribute to costs of the bankruptcy which may be considerable. Any excess proceeds of enforcement and for which there is no valid security right must be returned to the bankruptcy estate and may not be off set to any unsecured claims against the debtor. Lastly, the bankruptcy trustee may force the secured creditor to hand the proceeds of certain pledged assets (bodemzaken) over to the bankruptcy trustee for the benefit of the Dutch tax authorities pursuant to Article 57 (3) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, the provision of security or an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its bankruptcy trustee. This can occur if (i) the insolvent debtor performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) generally the creditor concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the insolvent debtor and (unless the act was for no consideration (om niet)) the party with whom or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. For the bankruptcy trustee, knowledge of prejudice is presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a “suspect period” of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. In addition, in case of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may nullify the debtor’s performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors. ----- _The Dutch Scheme_ With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet _homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“WHOA”) on 1 January 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a_ composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against an Issuer being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside The Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the noteholders. Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two thirds of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert. The WHOA could therefore have an adverse effect on the ability of noteholders to recover payments due on the notes. _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests_ Pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a security document may be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden) and other defenses afforded by Dutch law to obligors generally. Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be avoided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Furthermore, under Dutch law, a party to an agreement may under certain circumstances suspend performance of its obligations under such agreement pursuant to the exceptio non-adimpleti contractus or otherwise. Other impeding factors include a dissolution of a contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening). The enforceability of the obligations of an Issuer may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet _1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a_ Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs. Pursuant to Dutch law it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the security documents pursuant to which a security interest will be granted in the assets of a Dutch company could use a ----- parallel debt structure, whereby the Dutch company, as separate and independent obligations, undertakes to pay to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby amounts equal to the amounts due by it to the other creditors. Such parallel debt structure therefore creates a separate and independent claim of the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby which can be secured by a security interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt, and not as a representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the creditors. It is expressly agreed in such a parallel debt provision that the obligations of the debtor to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa). However, such a parallel debt structure has never been tested before a Dutch court and we cannot assure that it will mitigate or eliminate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch law. A Dutch security interest can only serve as security for monetary claims (geldvorderingen) and be enforced upon default (verzuim) of the obligations secured thereby. Foreclosure on pledged property must be carried out in accordance with applicable provisions and limitations in The Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk _Wetboek) and The Netherlands Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering)._ Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by a Dutch company under a security interest may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest. The validity and enforceability of a security interest granted by or in, a Dutch company may also be successfully contested by that Dutch company (or their bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim. The validity and enforceability of the obligations of a Dutch company under a security interest may also be successfully contested by any creditor, or by the company’s respective bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy when the company is in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the interests of any other creditor and the other requirements for voidable preference under The Netherlands Civil Code and Netherlands Bankruptcy Act are met. As a result, the value of the security interests provided by the Issuers may be limited. Pursuant to Article 2:7 of The Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), any transaction entered into by a legal entity may be nullified by the legal entity itself or its bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy if the objects of that entity were transgressed by the transaction and the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation (wist of zonder eigen onderzoek moest weten). The Dutch Supreme Court (Hoge Raad der Nederlanden) has ruled that in determining whether the objects of a legal entity are transgressed, not only the description of the objects in that legal entity’s articles of association (statuten) is decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into account, in particular whether the transaction is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit; and whether the subsistence of the company is jeopardized by the transaction. Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of bankruptcy. Pursuant to the actio pauliana provisions, legal acts performed by a natural or legal debtor can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant debtor and may be nullified by the liquidator in bankruptcy or by any creditor of that debtor outside bankruptcy, if: (i) such debtor performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the concerned creditor or, in the case of bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the relevant debtor and the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. This is different if the act was entered into for no consideration (om niet), in which case such knowledge by the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance. The liability of the Issuers under the relevant security documents, will be limited to the amount that will result in such security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of the Issuers. There is a possibility that the entire security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. ----- If a court were to find that the guaranteeing of the Notes, or the granting of the security, was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under such security documents are ineffective, could void the security over the collateral, or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Issuer and would be a creditor solely of a Guarantor, any other guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Notes Guarantee or Security Documents that have not been declared void. The general terms and conditions of Dutch banks applicable to bank accounts held in The Netherlands often provide for a restriction on the creation of security over bank account receivables in favor of third parties. As a result, it may not be possible to create security over bank accounts held in The Netherlands unless prior consent has been obtained from the relevant account bank. Without such consent there may be no valid security over the Dutch bank accounts. In addition, also if the consent has been granted and a valid security right has been created, such security is subject to a right of pledge and right of set-off of the account bank based on the General Banking Conditions (Algemene Bankvoorwaarden), unless such rights of pledge and set-off have been waived by the relevant account bank. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,365,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON NOTES GUARANTEES AND SECURITY,365.3,"EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts of",365.3.2,,"the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as this term is used in Article 3(1) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, which is further discussed below) is situated (the “COMI”) have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The New EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the New EU Insolvency Regulation that, as regards The Netherlands, includes, among others, the insolvency proceedings, court-approved refinancing agreements, outof-court payment proceedings and anticipated arrangement proposals. The determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. In accordance with Article 3(1) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, the COMI of a company is presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption only applies if such company’s registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. However, it is possible to rebut this presumption “where the company’s central administration is _located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State” (preamble 30 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation)._ Prior to June 26, 2017, when the New EU Insolvency Regulation came into effect, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a company’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where such company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and it may change from time to time, but it is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time ----- of the filing of the insolvency petition unless (as set forth above) the registered office has been moved within the 3-month period prior to the filing of the insolvency petition. The New EU Insolvency Regulation distinguishes between: - main insolvency proceedings, which have universal scope and are aimed at encompassing all the debtor’s assets, and - secondary insolvency proceedings, which run in parallel with the main insolvency proceedings and are limited to the assets located in a different Member State to that in which the debtor has its COMI. Main insolvency proceedings in respect of a debtor may be commenced in the jurisdiction of the Member State (other than Denmark) where such debtor has its COMI and, therefore, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence any of the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, including those mentioned above. Those main insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the New EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark). Secondary (or ‘territorial’) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State against the same debtor, but only if such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation to mean a place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Depending on whether the main insolvency proceedings commence prior to or after the commencement of secondary insolvency proceedings, the following scenarios should be noted: - where main insolvency proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which a debtor has its COMI, any insolvency proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State shall be secondary insolvency proceedings; and - where main insolvency proceedings in the Member State in which a debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be opened in such other Member State where such debtor has an establishment in the event that either (a) main insolvency proceedings cannot be opened because of the conditions laid down by the law of the Member State within the territory of which the debtor’s COMI is situated; or (b) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (x) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested; or (y) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, any territorial insolvency proceedings which were commenced prior to that date shall become secondary insolvency proceedings. Accordingly, the courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the main insolvency proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings (because the relevant debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of such debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the relevant debtor has assets. ----- In order to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may also give a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary proceedings could be opened that, when distributing assets or realization proceeds, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under national law that creditors would have if secondary proceedings were opened in that Member State. This, however, is subject to a “qualified majority” (as defined under national law) of known local creditors (being creditors whose claims against a debtor arose from or in connection with the operation of an establishment situated in a Member State other than the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is located) approving the undertaking. The law applicable to the distribution of proceeds and ranking of claims is also the law of the state where secondary insolvency proceedings are opened. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus (i.e. the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). Following the entry into force of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a debtor’s COMI has shifted in the preceding 3 months, the rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Moreover, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (which will no longer be limited only to “winding-up proceedings”) will be possible not only if the relevant debtor has an establishment in such Member State at the time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if such debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings. Please note that jurisdictions outside the European Union may not require a COMI shift in order for a Dutch company to make a filing in those jurisdictions (similar to the UK with respect to schemes of arrangements). Yet, recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings not based on COMI or a reasonable connection of an equivalent nature in The Netherlands should not be possible and, in addition, any creditor could file for a non-main insolvency proceeding in The Netherlands. _Insolvency proceedings of members of a group of companies_ As the Issuers and the Guarantors are members of a group of companies, it is noteworthy that Chapter V of the New EU Insolvency Regulation (Articles 56 et seq.) has introduced a process by which a group of companies experiencing difficulties may commence group coordination proceedings featuring the appointment of a single insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of that group’s members. Under Article 61 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in the insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. In any event, participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations of a Reorganization Plan (defined below) is voluntary. _Third-parties’ rights in rem_ The New EU Insolvency Regulation also provides for some important rules regarding the rights of secured creditors, in particular under Article 8, according to which the opening of insolvency proceedings shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third-parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to time, belonging to the debtor which are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. In particular, these rights in rem shall mean: (a) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; ----- (b) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; (c) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and (d) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The right, recorded in a public register and enforceable against third-parties, based on which a right in _rem within the meaning of Article 8 (1) may be obtained, shall be considered to be a right in rem._ These provisions under Article 8(1) shall not preclude actions for voidness, voidability or unenforceability as referred to in point (m) of Article 7(2) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation. _Brexit_ The UK is no longer a member of the EU and ceased to be treated as such at 11:00 p.m. (London time) on December 31, 2020. Amongst other implications is that, generally speaking, the provisions of the New EU Insolvency Regulation (including, in particular, those providing for automatic, mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings) no longer apply as between the UK and Member States. Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast)), and the 2007 Lugano Convention (on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters), which had previously been considered as potential bases on which UK schemes of arrangement might be recognized in Member States, also generally ceased to apply to the UK. As a result, the issue of whether UK insolvency and restructuring proceedings would be recognized in Member States, and vice versa, has become materially more uncertain and complex. In the UK, there remains a framework for the recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in, and/or judgments of the courts of, a Member State, including under the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (subject to the satisfaction of the relevant threshold requirements). Recognition in any Member State of UK insolvency or restructuring proceedings will be a question of the domestic laws of that country, including applicable EU law. Certain Member States have adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, which may allow for the recognition of UK insolvency proceedings on a similar basis to UK recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings under the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006. Depending on the relevant circumstances, UK restructuring proceedings may still be recognized in a Member State under the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements, EC Regulation 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I), and/or under private international law rules applicable in that country. In summary, however, recognition of insolvency and restructuring proceedings as between the UK and Member States is no longer automatic and there is increased risk that recognition will not be forthcoming in all relevant jurisdictions. This may necessitate parallel proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, which could result in increased costs, delay and potential inconsistency in approach or outcome.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.40,,23.40.1,,"The Issuers, the Target and its subsidiaries are companies organized under the laws of The Netherlands. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers, the Target and the Group are non-residents of the United States and all of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a consequence, you may not be able to effect service of process on these non-U.S. resident directors and officers in the United States or to enforce judgments against them outside of the United States, including judgments of the U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or our directors you will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where we or the relevant director has assets. As a result, it could be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals outside of the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the applicable securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws outside of the United States could render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors. While the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for The Netherlands, you should consult with your own advisors as needed to enforce a judgment in The Netherlands or elsewhere outside the United States. There is currently no treaty between the United States and The Netherlands for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be automatically be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction. Under current practice, however, a Dutch court will generally, subject to compliance with certain procedural requirements, recognize and give effect to the judgment if such judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) has not been rendered in violation of principles of proper procedure (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) is not contrary to the public policy of The Netherlands, and (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a foreign court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is capable of being recognized in The Netherlands. Dutch courts may deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or other awards. If a Dutch court upholds and regards as conclusive evidence the final judgment of the U.S. court, the Dutch court will generally grant the same judgment without litigating again on the merits. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in The Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Based on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that U.S. investors will be able to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities. Dutch civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. Such pre-trial discovery process does not exist under Dutch law. In the event directors or other third parties are liable towards a Dutch company, only the company itself can bring a civil action against those parties. The individual shareholders do not have the right to bring an action on behalf of the company. Only in the event that the cause for the liability of a third party to the company also constitutes a tortious act directly against a shareholder, such shareholder has an individual right of action against such third party in its own name. The Dutch Civil Code does provide for the possibility to initiate such actions collectively and a foundation or an association whose objective is to protect the rights of a group of persons having similar interests can institute a collective action. The collective action itself does not result in an order for payment of monetary damages but may only result in a declaratory judgment. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as used in the 2020 Annual Report dated 6 December 2021.

Therefore, these condensed consolidated interim financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 month before 31 December 2019 or 1 January 2019 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forwardlooking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group has identified the GDP and the unemployment rate of the countries in which it sells its goods and services to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors. On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2019 was determined as included in the schedule on for both trade receivables and contract assets.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,382,CREDIT RISK,382.13,,382.13.1,,"As at 30 September 2021, the gross amount of the trade receivables is EUR 524.5 million (31 December 2020: EUR 585.7 million). Credit loss allowances of EUR 93.0 million (31 December 2020: EUR 95.5 million) are recognized based on probability weighting of multiple scenarios including forward looking information. The movement of the credit loss allowance is as follows: Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group’s clients primarily consist of consumers and businesses with low average balances which are regularly reviewed. When necessary, these consumers are disconnected from service when no payment is received. Credit risk is taken into account through a combination of specific and general valuation allowances. Several debt collection agencies are commissioned to collect outstanding receivables and inform the Group about the status of doubtful debts. This valuation is done by the agencies based on complex models taking various indications into account. For further information please also refer to the Note “Transfer of assets (factoring of receivables)” down below. As at 31 December 2020, the gross amount of the trade receivables is EUR 585.7 million (31 December 2019: EUR 624.6 million). Credit loss allowances of EUR 95.5 million (31 December 2019: EUR 85.8 million) are recognized based on probability weighting of multiple scenarios including forward looking information. . The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 12 to 45 months, depending on the segment, and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The movement of the credit loss allowance was as follows: Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. The Group does not have any significant concentration of credit risk. The Group’s clients primarily consist of consumers and businesses with low average balances which are regularly reviewed. When necessary, these consumers are disconnected from service when no payment is received. Credit risk is taken into account through a combination of specific and general valuation allowances. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of financial assets mentioned above. For further information please also refer to the section “Transfer of assets (factoring of receivables)” down below. As at 31 December 2019, the gross amount of the trade receivables is EUR 624.6 million. Credit loss allowances of EUR 85.8 million (31 December 2018: EUR 50.3 million) are recognized for uncollectability.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,383,INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT,383.1,,383.1.1,,"The Group has two fixed interest group loan facilities. These loans are carried at amortized cost and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined in IFRS 7. As per 30 September 2021 the fixed interest rate is 4.25% for the loan granted in 2018 and 1.64% for the loan drawn in December 2020. Future refinancing might lead to a different interest rate. For one factoring agreement the Group is exposed to variable interest rates of 1month Euribor plus a fixed margin of 95bps. For the other two agreements the Group is exposed to variable interest rates of 1month Euribor plus a fixed margin of 65. Given the current negative Euribor interest rates and the expected developments in the market interest, the Group does not have measures in place as the risk is considered to be low. Changes in the market interest rate could have an impact on the carrying amount of financial instruments carried at fair value. However, this variability is not managed, as this risk is limited due to the short-term character of the concerning instruments. Changes in the market interest rates of financial instruments with fixed interest rates only affect income if these are measured at their fair value. The Group has two fixed interest group loan facilities. These loans are carried at amortized cost and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined in IFRS 7. As per December 31, 2020 the fixed interest rate is 4.25% for the loan granted in 2018 and 1.64% for the loan drawn in the current year. Future refinancing might lead to a different interest rate. For the three factoring agreements the Group is exposed to variable interest rates of 1month Euribor plus a fixed margin of 95bps.

The Group offers the eligible employees SARs with the option to either (i) participate in the Scheme in full (100%), (ii) participate in the Scheme for 50% or (iii) not participate in the Scheme at all. The eligible participants consisting of T-Mobile board of management, Leadership Team and Managers have signed up. In order to participate in the Scheme, the eligible persons are required to make specific financial commitments. Therefore, the variable compensation components of the Short Term Incentive (STI) and the Long Term Incentive (LTI) of an eligible person will be paid in SARs. Each SAR entitles the relevant participant to share in the value increase of the shares up to the vesting date. The value increase is measured as the difference between the base enterprise value of T-Mobile and the enterprise value at the vesting date for two schemes (I and II). The general scheme set-up (scheme I) is as follows. There are two classes of SARs: (a) SARs in Class A, which relate to a Value Creation up to and including a certain value threshold amount (“A SARs”); and (b) SARs in Class B, which relate to a value creation in excess over the threshold amount (“B SARs”). A SARs and B SARs are granted, are allocated and vest in pairs (“SAR Pairs”). The ratio between outstanding A SARs and B SARs are at all times 1:1. The total number of SAR pairs available to be granted under the scheme is 10,000,000 (the “SAR pool”). The SARs under scheme II are designated as C SARs. The total number of C SARs available to be granted under the scheme is 500,000. The vesting will entitle the participant to the SAR cash-out amount at the vesting date, which is the earlier of the end date of the SAR scheme being 31 December 2021 or another exit event. The cash-out payment is calculated as the percentage of the employee’s SAR pairs represent in the total number of vesting SAR pairs multiplied by the amount Vesting Value. The Vesting Value calculates as the sum of the amount becoming available on all Vesting A SARs, being an amount equal to 8% of the Value Creation up to and including the Value Creation of the threshold amount and the amount becoming available on all Vesting B SARs, being an amount equal to 6% of the Value Creation in excess of the threshold amount. The vesting value of Vesting C SARs is an amount equal to 4% of the Value Creation. The Value Creation is determined as an amount equal to the equity value of 100% of the Shares at the Vesting Date (the “Realization Value (100%)”) minus the aggregate of the Base Equity Value (plus the Net FCF Adjustment and minus Transaction Costs), whereby the Realization Value (100%) will be determined by an Independent Appraiser, based on customary valuation principles.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The cost of an acquired business is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, comprising the: - the fair values of the assets transferred - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business - equity interest issued by the Group - fair value of any asset and liability resulting from contingent consideration arrangement, and - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized in full at their fair values at the acquisition date, regardless of the level of the investment held by the Group. The Group recognized any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill arising in a business combination is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the cost of acquisition, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and in a business combination achieved in stages, the fair value of the equity interest held by the Group in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date over the fair value of the net assets acquired. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. Any difference arising on the revaluation of equity interests previously held by the Group is recognized in profit or loss. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date.

However, the consequences of the COVID-19 outspread and measures taken by the government have not materially affected the supply and demand for the Company’s primary services. Therefore, its operating results and cash flows from operations have not been negatively impacted subsequently, and the company has sufficient liquidity. T-Mobile has taken several measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 within the company. Retail shops were closed as from 16 March 2020 and reopened shortly thereafter, taking into account necessary safety measures for our employees and customers. As of 15 December 2020, government has issued new measures to cope with COVID-19. Based on the new measures T-Mobile was forced to close its shops. As per Q1 2021 customers are allowed to visit T-shops on an appointment basis and since 28 April 2021 we are allowed to welcome our customers in our shops without an appointment. We have implemented a working from home policy and enabled our employees to work from home in the best possible way. Our networks are stable and can currently cope well with the additional volume caused by increased numbers of people working from home. Based on the facts and circumstances known at this moment and the possible scenarios about how the COVID-19 virus and resulting government measures could evolve, management has determined that, whilst uncertain, we do not believe, however, that the impact of the COVID-19 virus would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant judgements concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows, applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values. Specifically, the estimation of cash flows underlying the fair values from the mobile business considers the continued investment in network infrastructure required to generate future revenue growth through the offering of new data products and services, for which only limited historical information on customer demand is available. If the demand for these products and services does not materialize as expected, this would result in less revenue, less cash flow, and potential impairment.

Management determined three cash-generating units: Consumer, Business and Other. The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates by management. Methods used to calculate the recoverable amount include discounted cash flowbased methods and methods that use market prices as a basis. The measurements based on discounted cash flows are founded on projections that are based on financial plans that have been approved by management and are also used for internal purposes. The planning horizon selected reflects the assumptions for short- to medium-term market developments and is selected to achieve a steady state in the business outlook that is necessary for calculating the perpetual annuity. F-37 ----- This steady state is only reached based on the planning horizon selected, in particular due to the sometimes long investment cycles in the telecommunications industry and the investments planned and expected in the long run to acquire and extend the rights of spectrum use. Cash flows beyond the internal mid-term planning are extrapolated using appropriate growth rates. The key assumptions on which management has based its calculation of the recoverable amount include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on past experience as well as internal expectations, and that are underscored by external market data and estimates: development of revenue, customer acquisition and retention costs, churn rates, capital expenditure, market share, and growth rates. Discount rates are determined based on external figures derived from the market, taking account of the risks associated with the cash-generating unit.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets. In determining lifetime expected credit losses: - receivables are grouped based on historical credit loss experience; - different loss rates are determined for the different ageing buckets of trade receivables. - historical credit loss experience is adjusted to incorporate relevant forward-looking information.

Judgement in accounting for demerger of T- Infra B.V. and subsequent lease back of assets,412.1.1,,"On 1 September 2018, T-Mobile demerged T-Infra B.V., consisting primarily of passive infrastructure and site lease agreements, and subsequently transferred Infra B.V. as a dividend in kind to Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V., the company’s parent company, on 1 January 2019. In 2018 after the demerger, T-Mobile entered into a lease agreement with the newly founded Infra B.V. regarding the demerged passive infrastructure and sites. The Group has concluded that the transfer of Infra B.V. is a transfer of a business as it meets the definitions under IFRS. The business was transferred in the amount of EUR 130 million of net assets of which EUR 82 million related to allocated goodwill previously recognized on the acquisition of a network. It also includes an amount of EUR 343 million for a right of use asset and a lease liability for the same amount recognized under IFRS 16 for the site leases on 1 January 2019. There are no changes in the current reporting figures in relation to the demerger of the T-Infra B.V. business. The Group has also concluded that the transfer of the business is a transaction under common control and in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, such transfer and dividend in kind distribution takes place at book values. The lease contract entered into is accounted for under IFRS 16. The right of use asset recognized for the lease agreement between T-Infra and T-Mobile which includes lease payments for the passive infrastructure and the site leases, but also for maintenance, amounted to EUR 435 million as at 1 January 2019. This means that the passive equipment previously carried at cost and the right of use assets related to the greenfield and rooftop spaces is transferred and consequently leased back. As the lease is entered into at market terms the right of use asset for the new lease is measured in line with these market terms. Considering the substance of the transaction, the Group assessed whether the sale lease back guidance of IFRS 16 should be applicable in this transaction and as such should the passive infrastructure remain at its original book value and not be remeasured, leading to lower amortization in the future. The Group has considered both applicability of the sale lease back guidance as well as the alternative view that sale and lease back guidance is not applicable. It was concluded that while in substance this may well represent a sale and lease back transaction, the original transfer of the Infra business is a transaction under common control, for which IFRIC 17 is not applicable. Our policy is to account for non-cash dividends within the Group and other common control transactions at book value. Applying sale lease back guidance will result in a lower right of use asset and as such a lower amount of depreciation in the future which is akin to recognizing a gain on the distribution of Infra to the parent at a later date, which is contradicting the purpose of the common control transaction guidance. The Group therefore concluded that the sale lease back guidance is not applicable, which is regarded a management judgement in the Group’s accounting for this transaction. Following the decision to distribute T-Infra B.V. to the shareholders of the Group, the T-Infra B.V. assets and liabilities have been presented as held for distribution to owners in the financial statements 2018. In this respect management needed to make judgements regarding the allocation of goodwill associated with the operation, anticipating where the goodwill will be recovered going forward.

Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the final settlement. Provisions are recognized for losses from executory contracts, provided a loss is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Because of the inherent uncertainties in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. In addition, significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to taxes and litigation risks. These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the support of internal specialists, if available, or with the support of outside consultants, such as actuaries or legal counsel. Revisions to the estimates of these losses from executory contracts may significantly affect future results of operations. For the Asset Retirement Obligation (‘ARO’) the Group used the costs results from the past and expectation of the future costs and discounted these amounts. The ARO provision for mobile network sites has a period lifetime equal to the lifetime of the most recently acquired spectrum licenses. F-39 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Gross versus net presentation: for assessment of gross or net presentation of revenues, the Group has assessed its customer contracts and has determined that it acts as a principal in all its contracts with customers. The Group has also assessed that revenues from handsets sold by indirect partners must be presented net, since the indirect partners are the principals in selling the handsets. The revenues from the other contract components from these indirect sales, e.g. service and connection fees are presented gross, since the company is the principal for these products and services. F-40 ----- The standalone selling prices of individual products or services that are part of multiple-element arrangements are complex to determine, because some of the elements are price-sensitive and, thus, volatile in a competitive marketplace. In many cases, standalone selling prices can also not be observed for the company’s own products. Due to the fact that comparability is generally not completely assured, the use of market prices for similar products is subject to an element of uncertainty, as is an estimate using a cost-plus-margin approach. Changes in estimates of standalone selling prices can significantly influence the allocation of the transaction price for the entire multipleelement arrangement among the individual performance obligations and therefore affect both the financial position, i.e. the carrying amount of contract assets and contract liabilities, and the current and future results of operations. Contract costs are recognized as an expense and amortized on a systematic basis over the expected duration of the customer relationship. The estimate of the expected average duration of customer retention is based on historical customer turnover. However, this is subject to fluctuations and has only limited informative value with regard to future customer behavior, particularly if new products are rolled out. If management’s estimates are revised, material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for subsequent periods. The significance of material rights is an estimate that is based on both quantitative and qualitative factors. This is ultimately a matter of judgement, even though it is supported by quantitative facts. Depending on the decision as to whether or not the customer has a material right to be deferred, there may be material differences in the amount and timing of revenues for the current and subsequent periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,414,2.12.6 JUDGEMENTS: EXTENSION AND TERMINATION OPTIONS FOR THE LESSEE,414.1,,414.1.1,,"In determining the term of leases of cell site space, land/ground, office buildings, and retail stores, which are the most relevant lease contracts in the Group, the following are the most relevant factors that are considered: - Rapidly advancing and ever-changing technology in the telecommunications industry requires flexible lease contracts, i.e. management tries to minimize longer periods during which the contracts cannot be canceled. - When determining whether an extension of a lease contract is reasonably certain, in addition to any significant penalties for terminating (or not extending) the lease, business plans and the business model are considered, e.g. cost/benefit analysis, consolidation plans for the mobile network and office facilities, new mobile network standards, significance of the property for the underlying operations, replacement or usage of additional technology, as well as the availability and cost of alternative locations. - Often leasehold improvements can also be used in alternative locations. In many cases, the costs of moving or replacing the asset or initial construction costs are not the main factor considered when determining whether to extend or not to extend the lease. - Significant investments made in a location, e.g. construction of towers and masts on the leased land, are economic penalties typically considered when determining the lease term. After having considered all of the factors above, for cell site contracts the Group concluded that it is not reasonably certain that an option to extend the lease term beyond the initial non-cancelable lease term will be exercised. For cell site contracts, other than the MLA site leases with T-Infra, but including the land/ground underneath the infrastructure, the lease term is on average 6 years and is considered reasonably certain depending on the significance of the leasehold improvement. Extension options after that period are typically not considered reasonably certain at commencement of the lease. Payments associated with these optional periods are not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities. Most extension options for office and shop leases are not included in the lease liability, because the Group could replace the leased assets without significant cost or business disruption. Exposure to future additional cash outflows will only arise when an extension option (not determined to be reasonably certain) is exercised or when a termination option (determined to be reasonably certain) is not exercised. F-41 ----- For the copper lines and MDF colocations within the asset category leased lines a portfolio approach is used due to the volume of the leased lines. To determine the lease term a mathematical approach is used in which the contract terms are leading. This is aligned with the strategically horizon of the Group. For leased lines, statistical information can be additionally used to determine the lease term. After the commencement date, the assessment of a reasonable certainty exercise is only reassessed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs that affects this judgement, and this is within the control of the lessee. T-Mobile reassesses the lease term when an option is exercised (or not exercised) or it becomes obligated to exercise (or not exercise). The cell site lease with T- Infra B.V. has an initial non-cancelable period of 15 years, during which the lease contract cannot be terminated. The initial period of time is followed by two renewal periods of ten years each (optional renewal period) and another unlimited numbers of further renewal periods of ten years each (additional renewal) if not terminated. The Group has the right to terminate after the initial term and before each optional and additional renewal, and T- Infra B.V. after the first additional renewal period. The Group’s termination rights after the initial lease term and after the two optional renewal periods, are options to extend the lease. This means that the non-cancelable period ends when the Group can exercise its termination right, and for any following periods the Group has effectively an option to extend, i.e. an unilateral right not to terminate the contract. As a consequence, management of the Group had to assess for what periods it is reasonably certain that it does not exercise the option and will thereby not extend the contract beyond the non-cancellable period. Management came to the conclusion that it is not reasonably certain that the option to renew the lease after the non-cancelable lease term of 15 years will be exercised. Therefore, the lease term under the application of IFRS 16 is deemed to be 15 years. This is in line with the strategic horizon of the Group. In determining the lease term, management applies judgement and considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. The threshold for a “reasonably certain” exercise is lower than “virtually certain” and higher than “more likely than not” under IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

If individual assets do not generate future cash flows independently from other assets, recoverability is assessed on the basis of the cash-generating unit to which the assets can be allocated. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit must be determined. In addition, impairment tests are carried out for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill) and intangible assets not yet available for use on a yearly basis. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit must be reduced in the amount of the difference. Impairment losses for goodwill must not be reversed. If the impairment loss recognized for the cash-generating unit exceeds the carrying amount of the allocated goodwill, the additional amount of the impairment loss is to be distributed on a pro-rata basis to the assets allocated to the cashgenerating unit. The fair values or values in use (if measurable) of the individual assets shall be considered to be the minimum values. If the reasons for previously recognized impairments no longer exist, the impairment losses on the assets concerned (with the exception of goodwill) must be reversed. The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The recoverable amount is generally determined by means of a discounted cash flow (‘DCF)’ calculation, unless it can be determined on the basis of a market price. These DCF calculations use projections that are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a ten-year period and are also used for internal purposes.

Provisions are recognized for these obligations provided they relate to past transactions or events, will probably require an outflow of resources to settle, and this outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions are carried at their expected settlement amount, taking into account all identifiable risks and uncertainties. The settlement amount is calculated on the basis of a best estimate. Suitable estimation methods and sources of information are used depending on the characteristics of the obligation. In case of a number of similar obligations, the Group of obligations is treated as one single obligation. The expected value method is used as the estimation method. If there is a range of potential events with the same probability of occurrence, the average value is taken. Individual obligations (e.g. legal and litigation risks) are regularly evaluated based on the most probable outcome, provided an exceptional probability distribution does not mean that other estimates would lead to a more appropriate evaluation. The measurement of provisions is based on past experience, current costing and price information, as well as estimates and reports from experts. If experience or current costing or price information is used to determine the settlement amount, these values are extrapolated to the expected settlement date. Suitable price trend indicators (e.g. construction price indexes or inflation rates) are used for this purpose. Provisions are discounted for the time value of money. Provisions are discounted using pre-tax market interest rates that reflect the term of the obligation and the risk associated with it (insofar as not already taken into consideration in the calculation of the settlement amount). Reimbursement claims are not netted against provisions; they are recognized separately as soon as their realization is virtually certain. Provisions for decommissioning, restoration, and similar obligations arising from the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are offset by a corresponding increase in the capitalized cost of the relevant asset. Changes at a later date in estimates of the amount or timing of payments or changes to the interest rate applied in measuring such obligations also result in retrospective increases or decreases in the carrying amount of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them.

This applies to an option presented in the comparative figures of the financial statements and refers to Simpel. No option is valued in the current reporting period. The Binomial Option Pricing Model computes enterprise value estimates for each step in-time between the valuation date and the option or warrant expiration date; effectively resulting in a binomial tree. At each final node of the tree (i.e. at expiration of the option) the option value is simply its intrinsic or exercise value. Under the risk neutrality assumption, today’s fair price of a derivative is equal to the discounted expected value of its future payoff. Therefore, at each earlier node of the tree, the option value is calculated using the option values from the next two nodes weighted by their respective probabilities. The expected value is then discounted at the risk-free rate. The valuation method is based on the enterprise value at valuation date, the volatility rate of the enterprise value based on the average median of the asset volatility of the peer group, the risk free interest rate based on the German government bond yield as at valuation date. Any derivatives financial assets that are not a part an effective hedging relationship are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Contingent liabilities are only recognized at their fair value if they were assumed in the course of a business combination. Contingent liabilities not assumed in the course of a business combination are not recognized. Contingent assets are not recognized.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,426,2.13.13 LEASES,426.1,a) Lessee,426.1.1,,"At the commencement date, a right-of-use asset measured at cost and a lease liability measured at the present value of the future lease payments must be recognized in the statement of financial position for all leases. This also applies to leases for which the underlying asset is of low value and to short-term leases (lease term of no more than twelve months). Non-lease components are not separated from lease components, i.e. all non-lease payments due under the contract are also recognized in the statement of financial position, except for the service components for buildings and shops. These costs are separated from the lease payments and recognized as service fees. This principle does not include contracts relating to data centers, which due to their special requirements in terms of equipment and premises form their own separate class of underlying asset. For this class of underlying assets, the non-lease payments are recognized as an expense. The lease liability is recognized at the present value of the future lease payments over the reasonably certain period of use. Lease payments are all fixed and in-substance payments, less any future lease incentives payable by the lessor. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, expected payments under residual value guarantees, and payments for reasonably certain purchase and termination options are also recognized. The series of payments is discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. All other variable payments are recognized as an expense. The lease liability is measured using the effective interest method and adjusted. The cost of the right-of-use asset is determined as the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred for obtaining the lease, the costs of installing the leased asset, and an estimate of any future restoration costs, less any lease incentives received from the lessor. In subsequent measurement, the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and, if applicable, adjusted for any impairment losses. If ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term, or if it is reasonably certain that a purchase or sale option will exist, the right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. The lease term is the period in which it is reasonably certain that an asset will be leased. In addition to the non-cancelable period of a lease, extensions will be included if their exercise is reasonably certain at the commencement of the lease term. This estimate is only to be reassessed upon occurrence of an event that necessitates a change. The lease term will be revised if an extension option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term is exercised or a termination option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term is not exercised. The adjustment of the lease term leads to a change in the future series of payments and therefore to remeasurement of the lease liability using a market rate of interest. The difference is recognized outside profit or loss as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset. Amounts derecognized that exceed the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset are recognized as an expense in profit or loss. A lease modification that substantially increases the scope of the original lease is accounted for as a separate lease if the lessee is granted an additional right to use one or more underlying assets and the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the standalone price for the increase in scope that the lessee would otherwise have to pay for use if it had leased these assets from a third party under a separate lease. Lease modifications that increase the scope of the lease but do not lead to the recognition of a separate lease are recognized outside profit or loss as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability for the existing lease. If a lease modification decreases the scope of the lease, the lessee must remeasure both the right-of-use asset and the lease liability and recognize any gain or loss on a pro-rata basis in profit or loss. The modified leases are measured at the modification date with the new, applicable interest rate. In the statement of cash flows, the Group has classified cash payments for leases as financing activities. F-51 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,426,2.13.13 LEASES,426.2,b) Lessor,426.2.1,,"If substantially all risks and rewards are attributable to the lessor (operating lease), the leased asset is recognized in the statement of financial position by the lessor. Measurement of the leased asset is then based on the accounting policies applicable to that asset. The lease payments are recognized in profit or loss by the lessor. Contractually defined future changes in the lease payments during the term of the lease are recognized as revenue from leases on a straight-line basis over the entire lease term, which is defined only once at the inception date of the contract. Where extension options exist, the exercise of those extension options that are reasonably certain is initially taken into account at the time the lease is concluded. If, contrary to the original expectation, these options are exercised or not exercised during the lease term, the estimated term will be adjusted and taken into account in the calculation of future lease revenue from operating lease transactions. If substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset are attributable to the lessee (finance lease), the lessor recognizes at the commencement date, in place of the leased asset, a finance lease receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The net investment in the lease is defined as the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the unearned finance income. The lease payments made by the lessees are split into an interest component and a principal component using the effective interest method. In subsequent measurement, the lease receivable is reduced by the principal received. The interest component of the payments received is recognized as finance income in the income statement. For sale and leaseback transactions, if there is a transfer of control within the meaning of IFRS 15, the Group as the seller-lessee measures the asset at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the lessor is recognized in profit or loss as the selling profit or loss.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,427,"2.13.15 NET REVENUE, CONTRACT ASSETS, CONTRACT LIABILITIES AND CAPITALIZED CONTRACT COSTS",427.1,,427.1.1,,"Net revenues include all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Group. Ordinary activities refer to the core business and to other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services. Revenues are recorded net of value-added tax and other taxes collected from customers. Value-added tax and other taxes collected are remitted to governmental authorities. Net revenues are recognized in accordance with the provision of goods or services, provided that collectability of the consideration is probable. For service contracts with a continuous service provision, the contractually agreed total consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term, regardless of the payment pattern. A contract asset must be recognized if the Group recorded revenue for fulfilment of a contractual performance obligation before the due date of the consideration from the customer. F-52 ----- A contract liability must be recognized when the customer paid consideration or a receivable from the customer is due before the Group fulfilled a contractual performance obligation and thus recognized revenue. In a customer contract, contract liabilities must be set off against contract assets. Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services (e.g. mobile service contract plus handset) must be separated into distinct performance obligations, based on the standalone selling price that is recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the customer. In the Group, this especially concerns the sale of a mobile handset or other telecommunications equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed-network telecommunications service contract. The total transaction price of the bundled contract is allocated among the individual performance obligations based on their relative—possibly estimated—standalone selling prices, i.e. based on a ratio of the standalone selling price of each separate element to the aggregated standalone selling prices of the contractual performance obligations. The Group does not sell own produced products (e.g. handsets). As a result, the revenue to be recognized for products (often delivered in advance) such as mobile handsets that are sold in combination with a long-term service contract may be either higher or lower than the amount billed or collected, depending on the ratio for these products relative to the aggregated standalone selling prices. This leads to the recognition of what is known as a contract asset or a contract liability in the statement of financial position, depending on whether the revenue recognized is higher (contract asset) or lower (contract liability) compared to the amount billed or collected. The contract asset is a receivable arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence. This leads to higher revenue, in contrast to the amounts billed from the sale of goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the provision of services. The contract liability is an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration, or for which an amount of consideration is due from the customer. The contract liability is reversed and reduced over the remaining contract period, increasing revenue from the other performance obligations (in this: mobile service revenues) and results in lower revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise compared with the amounts billed. As distinct from promotional offers, options to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or at a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is deferred as a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires, providing the discount on future purchases is an implicit component of the consideration for the current contract and is also significant. The measure of significance is whether the decision by the (average) customer to enter into the current contract is likely to have been significantly influenced by their right to the future discount. Offers for volume discounts for the purchase of additional core products of an entity (e.g. a discount offered on an additional fixed-network contract for mobile customers) are classed by the Group as promotional offers to be excluded from consideration. Long-term customer receivables (e.g. arising from sales of handsets in instalments), contract assets (in connection with the conclusion of a long-term customer contract) or contract liabilities (e.g. arising from a prepayment by the customer) are recognized at present value if the financing component is significant in relation to the total contract value (i.e. including those performance obligations that do not contain a financing component). The discount rate also reflects the customer credit risk. The Group makes use of the option not to recognize a significant financing component if the period between when a good or service is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Payments to customers including credits or subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue unless the payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service from the customer, for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated. Gross versus net presentation: In cases where a company is in an intermediary position between another supplier/vendor (e.g. manufacturer, wholesaler) and a retail customer, it must be assessed whether the company itself supplies the relevant product or provides the service requested by the customer as the principal or whether the company merely acts as the agent for the supplier. The F-53 ----- outcome determines whether the entity can recognize revenue on a gross basis (as the principal) or on a net basis after deducting the costs to the supplier (as the agent). For the Group, the question arises particularly in the case of digital services (e.g. streaming services) purchased from third parties and sold to retail customers as part of the Group’s product portfolio. In summary, in case of rights to another party’s goods or services, the Group considers itself to be the principal vis-à-vis the retail customer, if all of the following conditions are met and thus reports gross revenues: - The Group either has a contractual enforceable right to receive the predefined services “on demand” at predefined (fixed or variable) prices, and accordingly the other party has entered into an enforceable ongoing commitment to provide them, or the Group has entered into a material minimum purchase commitment. - The Group sells access to the other party’s services in its own name and for its own account under a contract between the Group and the retail customer. - The Group has discretion in setting the price for the other party’s services sold for its own account. Contract costs comprise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commissions paid to employees in the direct sales channel and third-party retailers in the indirect sales channel) and the costs to fulfil a contract. These must be capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be compensated by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would have not been incurred had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfil a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be capitalized under any other standard. The Group makes not use of the option to immediately recognize contract costs whose amortization period would be less than one year as an expense; this is in line with the DT group accounting policy. The capitalized contract costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer retention period. The expenses are disclosed in the Group’s income statement, not under depreciation and amortization but—depending on the sales channel—as goods and services purchased or personnel costs. In the indirect sales channel, third-party retailers often arrange service contracts on behalf of and for the account of the Group (as the agent), whereas in connection with the sale of handsets the thirdparty retailers act in their own name and for their own account (as the principal). In such cases, the third-party retailer receives the gross consideration of the handset from the Group and the same is recognized as loan receivable from the end-customer by the Group. In the direct sales channel the sale of subsidized handsets in connection with the conclusion of service contracts (multiple-element arrangement) is still common with business customers. In the subsidy model, an asset must thus be carried at the date of revenue recognition which is generally settled over a 24-months service contract term through payments made by the business customer, whereby the contract asset is repaid through the portion of the monthly invoice that exceeds the allocated monthly service revenues. Depending on the business model, revenue recognition at the Group is as follows: The mobile and fixed network business includes mobile services, narrow- and broadband access to the fixed network and the internet, television via internet, connection and roaming fees billed to other mobile operators (wholesale business), sales, other telecommunications equipment and accessories. Revenue generated from the use of voice and data communications as well as television via internet is recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. The services rendered relate to use by customers (e.g. call minutes), availability over time (e.g. monthly flat rates), or other agreed rate plans. Revenue and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled company obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement. The Group does not have warranties or related obligations. F-54 ----- Trade-in rights for used handsets which are granted to customers upon contract conclusion under the condition of a new purchase transaction (including renewal of an existing service contract) do not constitute repurchase arrangements; however, if the repurchase prices exceed the fair value of the handsets these rights must be recognized as separate performance obligations for which part of the contractual revenue is deferred until they are exercised or expire. Particularly in the mobile communications business, the timing of payments for mobile handsets purchased in connection with the conclusion of a service contract differs from the timing of the delivery and hence from revenue recognition. Where a significant financing component exists, revenue is measured at the present value. In case of a sale of handsets in connection with the conclusion of service contracts in the consumer business, the payment-by-instalment model is offered to customers. In the payment-by-instalment model, a handset loan must thus be carried at the date of revenue recognition which is generally repaid over a 24-month service contract term through payments made by the customer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,429,2.13.17 INCOME TAXES,429.12,,429.12.1,,"Income taxes include current income taxes as well as deferred taxes. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized where they are probable. They are measured in accordance with the tax laws applicable or already announced as of the reporting date, provided said announcement has the effect of actual enactment. Where current and deferred taxes are recognized, it must be reported as income or expense except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction which is recognized outside profit and loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, or in connection with a business combination. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position, if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, has an intention to settle net, and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities must be recognized in the amount that the Group expects to settle or recover from the tax authorities. They include liabilities/receivables for the current period as well as for prior periods. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position and the tax base, as well as for tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilize those temporary differences and losses. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. By way of derogation from this principle, deferred taxes are not recognized for temporary differences if deferred taxes arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit/tax loss. Deferred taxes are not recognized for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill. F-55 ----- Deferred taxes are generally recognized for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

The segments represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The impairment test for the goodwill was performed for the ending balance of the current period (31 December 2020) for the Company that includes Tele2 and Simpel. The annual impairment test for the goodwill as of 31 December 2020 did not result into an impairment for any of the CGUs. F-59 ----- The recoverable amounts to be identified for the impairment test were determined on the basis of the value in use. These figures were calculated using a net present value approach. The main parameters are shown in the table below. Input for the calculations for the recoverable amounts are the ten-year business planning projections, which are based on financial plans that have been approved by management and are also used for internal management purposes. The key assumptions on which management has based its determination of the recoverable amount include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on past experience and extended to include internal expectations, and that are underscored by external market data and estimates: - development of revenue, - customer acquisition and retention costs, - churn rates, - capital expenditure, - market share, and - growth rates. Discount rates are determined on the basis of external figures derived from the market, taking account of the market and country risks associated with the cash-generating unit. Changes in the assumptions may have a negative impact, as a result of future macro-economic trends, continued intense competition, further possible legislation changes (e.g. as part of national austerity programs) and regulatory intervention. Neither the impairment test nor the review on the accuracy of the forecast give rise to an indication of impairment. The goodwill impairment test resulted in a significant headroom of the value in use as compared to the carrying value. The goodwill of Simpel is completely attributable to the Consumer segment as the customer base of Simpel only consist of sim-only customers in the Consumer market. Since the acquisition of Tele2 at the beginning of 2019, the chief operating decision maker (board of management) examines the company’s performance based on its customer characteristics as opposed to the company as a whole and identified the three operating segments. The goodwill is therefore monitored and tested on a segment level as from 2019. The following tables set out the key assumptions for the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated: Management’s approach used to determine the CGU’ value in use for 2020 and 2019 is as follows: Goodwill is monitored and tested for impairment by management at the level of the three operating segments as determined in note 20. The segments represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The impairment test for the goodwill was performed for the ending balance of the current period (31 December 2019) for the Company that includes Tele2. The annual impairment test for the goodwill as of 31 December 2019 did not identify a need for impairment. Management has considered the transition to IFRS 16 in preparing the impairment test. These changes are reflected in the table below. The recoverable amounts to be identified for the impairment test were determined on the basis of the value in use. These figures were calculated using a net present value approach. The main parameters are shown in the table below. Input for the calculations for the recoverable amounts are the ten-year F-137 ----- business planning projections, which are based on financial plans that have been approved by management and are also used for internal management purposes. The key assumptions on which management has based its determination of the recoverable amount include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on past experience and extended to include internal expectations, and that are underscored by external market data and estimates: - development of revenue, - customer acquisition and retention costs, - churn rates, - capital expenditure, - market share, and - growth rates. Discount rates are determined on the basis of external figures derived from the market, taking account of the market and country risks associated with the cash-generating unit. Changes in the assumptions may have a negative impact, as a result of future macro-economic trends, continued intense competition, further possible legislation changes (e.g., as part of national austerity programs), and regulatory intervention. The following tables provide an overview of the main factors affecting the measurement. Neither the impairment test nor the review on the accuracy of the forecast give rise to an indication of impairment. The goodwill impairment resulted in a significant headroom of the value in use as compared to the carrying value. The goodwill carrying amount as per 31 December 2019 includes the goodwill for Tele2. Changes in the assumptions may have a negative impact, as a result of future macro-economic trends (e.g., impacts of COVID-19), continued intense competition, further possible legislation changes (e.g., as part of national austerity programs), and regulatory intervention. In 2018 only one cash generating unit (and operating segment) was identified and goodwill was monitored and tested for impairment at the level of the company as a whole. However, since the acquisition of Tele2 at the beginning of 2019, the chief operating decision maker (board of management) examines the company’s performance based on its customer characteristics as opposed to the company as a whole and identified the three operating segments.

Application of the standard is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. This standard provides a single, principles-based five-step model for the determination and recognition of revenue to be applied to all contracts with customers. F-180 ----- It replaces, in particular, IAS 18 and IAS 11 and has a material effect on the presentation of the Group’s results of operations and financial position. Depending on the business model applied, the new provisions and the related changes in the accounting principles applied by the Group affect the following issues in particular: — In the case of multiple-element arrangements (e.g., mobile contract plus handset), the total transaction price of the bundled contract is allocated among the individual, separate performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices, i.e., based on a ratio of the standalone selling price of each element to the aggregated standalone selling prices of the contractual performance obligations. In contrast to the previous accounting treatment, the relative standalone selling price of an individual element and thus the revenue recognized for this unit of accounting is no longer limited to that proportion of the total arrangement consideration to be provided by the customer, the payment of which does not depend on the delivery of additional elements (contingent revenue cap). As a result, the revenue to be recognized for products delivered in advance (e.g., mobile handsets) that are sold at a subsidized price in combination with a long-term service contract was limited by this subsidized price. Under IFRS 15, this limitation no longer applies, i.e., in the case of subsidized products delivered in advance, a larger portion of the total remuneration is attributable to the element delivered in advance (mobile handset), requiring earlier recognition of revenue under the new regulations. This leads to the recognition of what is known as a contract asset – a receivable arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence – in the statement of financial position. The contract asset is reduced over the remaining contract period, lowering revenue from the other performance obligations (in this case: mobile service revenues) compared with the amounts billed. At the same time, it results in higher revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise and in lower revenue from the provision of services. — The extent of the changes resulting from the initial application of IFRS 15 that are described above therefore largely depends on the business models used by the subsidiary in question. — Customer activation fees and other advance one-time payments by the customer that do not constitute consideration for a separate performance obligation are classified as contract liabilities, and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the (remaining) contract period. — Expenses for sales commissions (costs of obtaining a customer contract (contract costs)) must be capitalized and recognized over the estimated customer retention period. The expenses are disclosed in the Group’s income statement, not under depreciation and amortization but – depending on the sales channel – as goods and services purchased or personnel costs. — On first-time application of the standard, both total assets and shareholders’ equity increased due to the capitalization of contract assets and contract costs for contracts not yet fully completed. — In cases where “material rights” are granted – such as offering additional discounts for future purchases of further products – a portion of the transaction price must be deferred as a contract liability and is not recognized as revenue until this additional performance obligation has been satisfied or has lapsed. — Contract liabilities (which, as deferred revenue, were already recognized as liabilities in the past) must be netted against the contract assets for each customer contract. — For the purposes of determining whether the Group sells products for its own account (principal is gross revenue) or for the account of others (agent is net revenue), there are no material changes for the existing agreements. As regards IFRS 15, the Group utilizes the following accounting options: — The Group applies the option for simplified initial application, limiting the retroactive application of IFRS 15 to contracts that have not yet been completely fulfilled at the date of initial application. The contracts that have not yet been completely fulfilled as of 1 January F-181 ----- 2018 are accounted for as if they had been recognized in accordance with IFRS 15 from the very beginning. The cumulative effect arising from the transition is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity in the year of initial application. Prior-year comparatives are not adjusted; instead, the Group provides an explanation of the reasons for the changes in items in the statement of financial position and the income statement for the current period as a result of applying IFRS 15 for the first time. — A significant financing component is not considered for the amount and timing of revenue recognition if the period between when a promised good or service is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. The adjustments made to items in the statement of financial position as of 1 January 2018 and that are affected by the first-time application of IFRS 15are as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.

If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date.

The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows, applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values. Specifically, the estimation of cash flows underlying the fair values from the mobile business considers the continued investment in network infrastructure required to generate future revenue growth through the offering of new data products and services, for which only limited historical information on customer demand is available. If the demand for these products and services does not materialize as expected, this would result in less revenue, less cash flow, and potential impairment.

Methods used to calculate the recoverable amount include discounted cash flowbased methods and methods that use market prices as a basis. The measurements on the basis of discounted cash flows are founded on projections that are based on financial plans that have been approved by management and are also used for internal purposes. The planning horizon selected reflects the assumptions for short- to medium-term market developments and is selected to achieve a steady state in the business outlook that is necessary for calculating the perpetual annuity. This steady state is only reached based on the planning horizon selected, in particular due to the sometimes long investment cycles in the telecommunications industry and the investments planned and expected in the long run to acquire and extend the rights of spectrum use.

In many cases, standalone selling prices can also not be observed for the company’s own products. Due to the fact that comparability is generally not completely assured, the use of market prices for similar products is subject to an element of uncertainty, as is an estimate using a cost-plus-margin approach. Changes in estimates of standalone selling prices can significantly influence the allocation of the transaction price for the entire multipleelement arrangement among the individual performance obligations and therefore affect both the financial position, i.e., the carrying amount of contract assets and contract liabilities, and the current and future results of operations. Contract costs are deferred and generally recognized as revenue over the expected duration of the customer relationship. The estimate of the expected average duration of customer retention is based on historical customer turnover. However, this is subject to fluctuations and has only limited informative value with regard to future customer behavior, particularly if new products are rolled out.

If individual assets do not generate future cash flows independently of other assets, recoverability is assessed on the basis of the cash-generating unit to which the assets can be allocated. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit must be determined. In addition, annual impairment tests are carried out for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill) at a yearly basis. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit must be reduced in the amount of the difference. Impairment losses for goodwill must not be reversed. If the impairment loss recognized for the cash-generating unit exceeds the carrying amount of the allocated goodwill, the additional amount of the impairment loss is to be distributed on a pro-rata basis to the assets allocated to the cashgenerating unit.

Provisions are recognized for these obligations provided they relate to past transactions or events, will probably require an outflow of resources to settle, and this outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions are carried at their expected settlement amount, taking into account all identifiable risks and uncertainties. The settlement amount is calculated on the basis of a best estimate; suitable estimation methods and sources of information are used depending on the characteristics of the obligation. In case of a number of similar obligations, the Group of obligations is treated as one single obligation. The expected value method is used as the estimation method. If there is a range of potential events with the same probability of occurrence, the average value is taken. Individual obligations (e.g., legal and litigation risks) are regularly evaluated based on the most probable outcome, provided an exceptional probability distribution does not mean that other estimates would lead to a more appropriate evaluation. The measurement of provisions is based on past experience, current costing and price information, as well as estimates and reports from experts. If experience or current costing or price information is used to determine the settlement amount, these values are extrapolated to the expected settlement date. Suitable price trend indicators (e.g., construction price indexes or inflation rates) are used for this purpose. Provisions are discounted when the effect of the time value of money is material. Provisions are discounted using pre-tax market interest rates that reflect the term of the obligation and the risk associated with it (insofar as not already taken into consideration in the calculation of the settlement amount). Reimbursement claims are not netted against provisions; they are recognized separately as soon as their realization is virtually certain. Provisions for decommissioning, restoration, and similar obligations arising from the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are offset by a corresponding increase in the capitalized cost of the relevant asset. Changes at a later date in estimates of the amount or timing of payments or changes to the interest rate applied in measuring such obligations also result in retrospective increases or decreases in the carrying amount of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. These in turn change the depreciation of the asset to be recognized in the future, which leads to the changes in estimates being recognized in profit or loss over the remaining useful life.

If these are not available, the fair value is determined using standard valuation models on the basis of current market parameters. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding.

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.

The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. In calculating ECLs, the group applies a simplified approach.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,449,LIABILITIES,449.62,"2.8.17** **Net revenue, contract assets, contract liabilities and capitalized contract costs",449.62.1,,"Net revenues include all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Group. Ordinary activities refer to the core business and to other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services. Revenues are recorded net of value-added tax and other taxes collected from customers. Value-added tax and other taxes collected are remitted to governmental authorities. Net revenues are recognized in accordance with the provision of goods or services, provided that collectability of the consideration is probable. For service contracts with a continuous service provision, the contractually agreed total consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term, regardless of the payment pattern. A contract asset must be recognized if the Group recorded revenue for fulfilment of a contractual performance obligation before the customer paid consideration or before – irrespective of when payment is due – the requirements for billing and thus the recognition of a receivable exist. A contract liability must be recognized when the customer paid consideration or a receivable from the customer is due before the Group fulfilled a contractual performance obligation and thus recognized revenue. In a customer contract, contract liabilities must be set off against contract assets. Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services must be separated into distinct performance obligations, each with its own separate revenue contribution F-197 ----- that is recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the customer. In the Group, this especially concerns the sale of a mobile handset or other telecommunications equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed-network telecommunications contract. The total transaction price of the bundled contract is allocated among the individual performance obligations based on their relative – possibly estimated – standalone selling prices, i.e., based on a ratio of the standalone selling price of each separate element to the aggregated standalone selling prices of the contractual performance obligations. As a result, the revenue to be recognized for products (often delivered in advance) such as mobile handsets that are sold in combination with a long-term service contract is higher than the amount billed or collected. This leads to the recognition of what is known as a contract asset – a receivable arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence – in the statement of financial position. The contract asset is reversed and reduced over the remaining minimum contract period, lowering revenue from the other performance obligations (in this case: mobile service revenues) compared with the amounts billed. In contrast to the amounts billed, this results in higher revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the provision of services. As distinct from promotional offers, options to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or at a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is deferred as a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires, providing the discount on future purchases is an implicit component of the consideration for the current contract and is also significant. The measure of significance is whether the decision by the (average) customer to enter into the current contract is likely to have been significantly influenced by their right to the future discount. Offers for volume discounts for the purchase of additional core products of an entity (e.g., a discount offered on an additional fixed-network contract for mobile customers) are classed by the Group as promotional offers to be excluded from consideration. Long-term customer receivables (e.g., arising from sales of handsets in instalments), contract assets (in connection with the conclusion of a long-term customer contract) or contract liabilities (e.g., arising from a prepayment by the customer) are recognized at present value if the financing component is significant in relation to the total contract value (i.e., including those performance obligations that do not contain a financing component). The discount rate also reflects the customer credit risk. The Group makes use of the option not to recognize a significant financing component if the period between when a good or service is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Payments to customers including credits or subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue unless the payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service from the customer, for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated. Gross versus net presentation: In cases where a company is in an intermediary position between another supplier/vendor (e.g., manufacturer, wholesaler) and a retail customer, it must be assessed whether the company itself supplies the relevant product or provides the service requested by the customer as the principal or whether the company merely acts as the agent for the supplier. The outcome determines whether the entity can recognize revenue on a gross basis (as the principal) or on a net basis after deducting the costs to the supplier (as the agent). For the Group, the question arises particularly in the case of digital services (e.g., streaming services) purchased from third parties and sold to retail customers as part of the Group’s product portfolio. In summary, in case of rights to another party’s goods or services, the Group considers itself to be the principal vis-à-vis the retail customer if all of the following conditions are met and thus reports gross revenues: - The Group either has a contractual enforceable right to receive the predefined services “on demand” at predefined (fixed or variable) prices, and accordingly the other party has entered into an enforceable ongoing commitment to provide them, or the Group has entered into a material minimum purchase commitment. F-198 ----- - The Group sells access to the other party’s services in its own name and for its own account under a contract between the Group and the retail customer. - The Group has discretion in setting the price for the other party’s services sold for its own account. Contract costs comprise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commissions paid to employees in the direct sales channel and third-party retailers in the indirect sales channel) and the costs to fulfil a contract. These must be capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be compensated by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would have not been incur-red had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfil a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be capitalized under any other standard. The Group makes use of the option to immediately recognize contract costs whose amortization period would be less than one year as an expense. The capitalized contract costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer retention period. The expenses are disclosed in the Group’s income statement, not under depreciation and amortization but – depending on the sales channel – as goods and services purchased or personnel costs. In the indirect sales channel, third-party retailers often arrange service contracts on behalf of and for the account of the Group (as the agent) in connection with the sale of subsidized handsets in their own name and for their own account (as the principal). In such cases, the third-party retailer receives handset compensation for an amount equal to the long term handset loan the Group has engaged directly with the end-customer. In the case of multiple-element arrangements in the direct sales channel for business customers, the customer ultimately covers the handset subsidy by paying a price above the stand-alone selling price for the service contract. The Group considers this an implicit promise to the business customer that on conclusion of this service contract they will be able to purchase a handset at a discounted price. Depending on the business model, revenue recognition at the Group is as follows: The mobile and fixed-network business includes mobile services, narrow- and broadband access to the fixed network and the internet, television via internet, connection and roaming fees billed to other mobile operators (wholesale business), sales, other telecommunications equipment and accessories. Revenue generated from the use of voice and data communications as well as television via internet is recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. The services rendered relate to use by customers (e.g., call minutes), availability over time (e.g., monthly flat rates), or other agreed rate plans. Revenue and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled company obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement. Trade-in rights for used handsets which are granted to customers upon contract conclusion under the condition of a new purchase transaction (including renewal of an existing service contract) do not constitute repurchase arrangements; however, if the repurchase prices exceed the fair value of the handsets these rights must be recognized as separate performance obligations for which part of the contractual revenue is deferred until they are exercised or expire. Particularly in the mobile communications business, the timing of payments for mobile handsets purchased in connection with the conclusion of a service contract differs from the timing of the delivery and hence from revenue recognition. Where a significant financing component exists, revenue is measured at the present value. In case of a sale of handsets in connection with the conclusion of service contracts in the consumer business, the payment-by-instalment model is offered to customers. In the payment-by-instalment model, ahandset loan must thus be carried at the date of revenue recognition which is generally repaid over a 24-month service contract term through payments made by the customer.

Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized where they are probable. They are measured in accordance with the tax laws applicable or already announced as of the reporting date, provided said announcement has the effect of actual enactment. Where current and deferred tax is recognized, it must be reported as income or expense except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction which is recognized outside profit and loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, or in connection with a business combination. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, has an intention to settle net, and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities must be recognized in the amount that the Group expects to settle or recover from the tax authorities. They include liabilities/receivables for the current period as well as for prior periods. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position and the tax base, as well as for tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. By way of derogation from this principle, a deferred tax liability is not recognized for temporary differences if the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit/tax loss. A deferred tax liability is not recognized either for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill. A deferred tax liability is generally recognized for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Going forward, lessees will therefore no longer be required to make the distinction between finance and operating leases that was required in the past in accordance with IAS 17. For all leases, the lessee will recognize a lease liability in its statement of financial position for the obligation to make future lease payments. At the same time, the lessee will capitalize a right of use to the underlying asset which is equivalent to the present value of the future lease payments plus initial direct costs, directly attributable expenditure, advance payments and restoration costs, as well as less incentive payments received. Similar to the guidance on finance leases in IAS 17, the lease liability will be adjusted over the lease term for any remeasurement, while the right-of-use asset will be depreciated, which in contrast to the current lease expense normally leads to higher expenses at the inception date of a lease. For the lessor, on the other hand, the provisions of the new standard are similar to the existing guidance in IAS 17.

Material 2020 materiality IFRS 17 Insurance 1 January IFRS 17 governs the Contracts 2021 accounting for insurance contracts and replaces IFRS 4. No material impact. In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 “Leases.” The standard will be effective for the first time for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 has a material effect on the Group’s consolidated financial statements, particularly on total assets and liabilities, the results of operations, cash generated from operations, and the presentation of the financial position. The new regulations affects the Group as a lessee especially in relation to leases of cell sites (land, space in cell towers or rooftop surface areas), network infrastructure, and buildings used for administrative or technical purposes. The Group will not apply the new lease standard retrospectively in full, but will make use of the exemption provisions for lessees, also known as the modified retrospective method. On the transition to IFRS 16, payment obligations from existing operating leases will be discounted using the relevant incremental borrowing rate and recognized as a lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate of interest is determined by deriving benchmark interest rates for a period of up to 30 years from maturityrelated risk-free interest rates which are increased by a credit-risk premium and adjusted for a liquidity and country-risk premium. Weighted average incremental borrowing rates of 1.1 to 3.5 percent were applied to lease liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position as of 1 January 2019. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The right-of-use assets will be carried in the amount of the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments. Due among other things to the significant amount of liabilities from straight-line leases in accordance with IAS 17, which in accordance with IFRS 16 must be deducted from the right-of-use assets, as of 1 January 2019 the right-of-use assets under IFRS 16 must be carried at a lower amount than the corresponding lease liability. In the statement of cash flows, the repayment portion of the lease payments from existing operating leases will reduce net cash from/used in financing activities and no longer affect net cash from operating activities. Only the interest payments will remain in net cash from operating activities, the total of which will rise. - The Group’s transition to the new IFRS 16 standard has the following material effects as of 1 January 2019:The increase in total assets from the right of use of assets (without T-Mobile Infra B.V.) amounts to EUR 206.3. The increase in lease liabilities (without T-Mobile Infra B.V.) amounts to EUR 214.8 million. F-203 ----- - The impact of T-Mobile Infra B.V. on the right-of-use assets is an increase of EUR 102.8 milion. The lease liabilities increase by EUR 103.4 milion. The total increase for the right of use amounts to EUR 309.1 million. The total increase in lease liabilities amounts to EUR 318.2 million. - The operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 are EUR 291 milion and the adjustments resulting from discounting is EUR 56.1 milion. - Going forward and related to, depreciation charges are EUR 30 million to EUR 40 million higher and interest expense are EUR 3.5 million to EUR 4.5 million higher and will be reported in the consolidated income statement instead of lease expense. - T-Mobile Infra B.V. charges yearly costs in the amount of EUR 52 million to T-Mobile. The costs are recognised as intercompany charges from related parties. T-Mobile has a non-cancelable contract term with T-Mobile Infra B.V. of 15 years. Significant options and expedients will be exercised as follows: - Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities will be reported separately in the statement of financial position. - The recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements of IFRS 16 will also apply to short-term leases and leases based on low-value assets. - In leases that contain both lease components and non-lease components, a distinction will not be made between these components. Each lease component will be accounted for – as a lease – in conjunction with other related performance components. - Leases for intangible assets fall under IAS 38 rather than under IFRS 16. In addition, on the date of first-time adoption of IFRS 16, use will be made of the following options and expedients: - Provisions for onerous contracts recognized in connection with leases will be derecognized on 1 January 2019 against the right-of-use asset. Onerous contracts have not been identified by the Group. In determining the lease term, hindsight may be used where this provides a better estimate for the exercise of options to extend or terminate the lease. In general the shortest legal lease term will be determined and used as a lease term.

The Board of Management of T-Mobile is deemed to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The board reviews the results of the company as a whole in order to assess the performance of the business and to make capital allocation decisions. The annual impairment test for the goodwill as of 31 December 2018 did not identify a need for impairment. The recoverable amounts to be identified for the impairment test were largely determined on the basis of the fair value less costs of disposal. These figures were calculated using a net present value approach. The main parameters are shown in the table on the next page. Input for the calculations fo the recoverable amounts are the ten-year business planning projections, which are based on financial plans that have been approved by management and are also used for internal management purposes. The key assumptions on which management has based its determination of the recoverable amount include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on past experience and extended to include internal expectations, and that are underscored by external market data and estimates: - development of revenue, - customer acquisition and retention costs, - churn rates, - capital expenditure, F-208 ----- - market share, and - growth rates. Discount rates are determined on the basis of external figures derived from the market, taking account of the market and country risks associated with the cash-generating unit. Changes in the assumptions may have a negative impact, as a result of future macro economic trends, continued intense competition, further possible legislation changes (e.g., as part of national austerity programs), and regulatory intervention.The following tables provide an overview of the main factors affecting the measurement.

The purpose of the Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme is to support further growth and success of business of the Group by providing an incentive for members of the Management Board and other employees to perform to the best of their abilities and to remain in the service of the Group. Eligibility to participate in the Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme is determined at the sole discretion of the Supervisory Board. The rights entitle the employees to a cash payment at the end date (31 December 2021). The amount payable will be determined based on the increase of the Group’s equity value between the grant date and the vesting date (31 December 2021). To determine the vesting value of the rights, certain internal parameters have been used. The Stock Appreciation Rights must be exercised on vesting date and will expire if not exercised on that date. The maximum amount payable of the Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme is EUR 80 million. Under the Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme a total of 10,000,000 rights are available to grant to employees. Each right is divided into one Class A right and one Class B right. Both classes are related to a certain value creation at the vesting date. The Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme includes a leaver arrangement. Based on certain criteria, an employee shall be entitled to receive a pro rate share of the amount payable. The fair value of a Stock Appreciation Right pair as at 31 December 2018 was EUR 6.75, amounting to a total expected pay-out of EUR 44.4 million in 2022.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 month before 31 December 2018 or 1 January 2018 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forwardlooking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group has identified the GDP and the unemployment rate of the countries in which it sells its goods and services to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors. F-219 ----- On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2018 and 1 January 2018 (on adoption of IFRS 9) was determined as included in the schedule on for both trade receivables and contract assets. The group exercises considerable judgment in the classification of their in-house cash pool balances as cash equivalents. These in-house cash pool balances are managed within the Deutsche Telekom AG (DTAG) group treasury function. The DTAG group treasury function operates as an in-house bank which has similar characteristics as a regular bank. It maintains sufficient cash and liquid resources, along with access to credit lines, to meet all inter-company obligations simultaneously. With respect to DTAG’s liquidity risk, DTAG has met its targets for the liquidity reserve to cover at least the maturities for the next 24 months in both 2017 and 2018. Deutsche Telekom had standardized bilateral credit agreements with 22 banks for a total of EUR 12.9 billion as of 31 December 2018. As of 31 December 2018, EUR 0.6 billion of these credit lines had been utilized. The DTAG central treasury department is responsible for the coordination of all intragroup cash and payment flows. The internal control processes and procedures from the DTAG central treasury department are implemented and monitored according to the minimum requirements set by the German Financial Market Authority, where applicable. The DTAG central treasury department monitors the balances of all companies that are part of the central cash pooling and ensures sufficient funding of the respective balances. In addition the company has direct access to these cash pool accounts and is entitled to terminate the cash pooling agreement without notice for good reason. Management have therefore assessed that these balances are highly liquid instruments that are also subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s maximum credit risk can be depicted as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

The debtors are consumers as well as business customers. In none of the transactions is T-Mobile exposed to risks other than the credit risk and late-payment risk resulting from the sold receivables agreed in the respective agreement. The term of the agreements ends between 2020 and 2021. The factoring transactions involve the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining at T-Mobile without the involvement of structured entities(I) and the factoring agreements involve the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining at T-Mobile with the involvement of structured entities. (I) Factoring transactions involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining at T-Mobile without the involvement of structured entities. A factoring transaction is in place under which banks are required to purchase trade receivables. The receivables sold entail charges from sales of handsets payable over a period of up to two years. The factoring agreement has a maximum funding amount of EUR 90 million. The purchase price will be paid out immediately upon sale. The term of the factoring transaction ended on 30 June 2019. On 5 December 2019 the term of this factoring transaction has been extended to 30 June 2021. The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the receivables sold are the credit risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). The purchase price corresponds to the nominal amount. The maximum credit risk from the various tranches to be borne by T-Mobile amounts to EUR 14.6 million (2017: EUR 14.4 million). The other credit risk-related losses are borne by the banks. The late-payment risk continues to be borne by T-Mobile. T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 14.6 million (2017: EUR 14.4 million), and the carrying amount of the associated liability was EUR 14.6 million (2017: EUR 14.4 million). The outstanding amount of receivables as per 31 December 2018 for this particular factoring transaction amounted to EUR 78.5 million (2017: EUR 37.2 million). In 2018 T-Mobile expensed EUR 1.1 million, including credit-risk discounts and loss allocations to cover monthly credit risks, in the financial year from its continuing involvement including program fees (interest and bank margin), and has expensed a total amount of EUR 4.5 million since the beginning of the transaction. (II) Factoring transactions involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control remaining at T-Mobile with the involvement of structured entities. The factoring agreements have a maximum program volume of EUR 150 million. If the buyer agrees to purchase receivables beyond this amount, the purchase price payment shall be deferred until the maximum program volume decreases again by the corresponding amount. With this structure, there is no structured entity consolidated by T-Mobile. Rather, the receivables are sold directly to a structured entity that is not consolidated by T-Mobile due to the lack of ability to direct the entity’s relevant activities. This structured entity holds the receivables and allocates the risks and rewards resulting from these to T-Mobile and a bank on the basis of contractual arrangements. The structured entity is financed through the issue of commercial paper to third parties outside T-Mobile or, alternatively, through a credit facility provided by a bank. In one receivables portfolio, the receivables are purchased in an automated process based on the purchase criteria set out in the receivables purchase agreement. In another receivables portfolio, the structured entity has the freedom to decide whether and which receivables will be purchased, though purchase of the agreed minimum volume is imperative. T-Mobile is obligated to buy back aged receivables and receivables for which a write-down is imminent at nominal value. The cash flows resulting from the buy-backs would occur in the month following the buy-back. Such buy-backs of receivables would not affect the allocation of the credit riskrelated losses in any way, as the latter would be passed back to the buyers in line with the agreed risk allocation. The nominal volume of the receivables sold by T-Mobile and not yet settled by the debtors was EUR 134 million (2017: EUR 115 million) as of the reporting date. None of the structured entities has business activities other than the purchase or sale of trade receivables or other investments. The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the sold receivables are based on the credit risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). The maximum credit risk to be borne by T-Mobile amounts to EUR 7.4 million (2017: EUR 6.4 million) as of the reporting date when translated into euros F-224 ----- and is largely attributable to transactions involving structured entities. The other credit risk-related losses are borne by the buyers. The late-payment risk continues to be borne in full by T-Mobile. The maximum exposure to loss for T-Mobile resulting from credit risk and late-payment risk relating to the receivables sold at the reporting date is EUR 7.6 million (2017: EUR 6.6 million) and is largely attributable to transactions involving structured entities. Substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables were neither transferred nor retained (allocation of the material risks and rewards between T-Mobile and the buyers). T-Mobile continues to perform servicing for the receivables sold. Under the factoring agreements in which structured entities are engaged, buyers have the right to transfer the servicing to third parties for no specific reason. Although T-Mobile is not authorized to use the receivables sold other than in its capacity as servicer, it retains control over the receivables sold because the buyers and the structured entities do not have the practical ability to resell the purchased receivables. At the time the receivables are sold, the fair value of the expected losses is expensed. Expected future payments are presented as a component of the associated liability. In transactions with structured entities, certain portions of the purchase price are initially held back and, depending on the amount of the actual defaults, are only paid to T-Mobile at a later date. To the extent that such portions of the purchase price are expected to be received in the future, they are recognized at fair value. T-Mobile continues to recognize the trade receivables sold to the extent of its continuing involvement, i.e., in the maximum amount with which it is still liable for the credit risk and late-payment risk inherent in the receivables sold, and recognizes a corresponding associated liability presented in liabilities to banks. The receivables and the associated liability are then derecognized in the extent to which T-Mobile’s continuing involvement is reduced (particularly when payment is made by the customer). The carrying amount of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the extent to which the actual losses to be borne by T-Mobile resulting from the credit risk and the late-payment risk exceed the losses initially expected. This amount is recognized as an expense. T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 7.4 million (2017: EUR 6.4 million), and the carrying amount of the associated liability was EUR 7.6 million (2017: EUR 6.6 million). T-Mobile presents the purchase price payments received from the buyers under cash generated from operations where these relate to the derecognized portion of the receivables, and under net cash from/used in financing activities where they relate to the portion of the receivables that is still recognized. The volume of receivables sold was not subject to major fluctuations since the beginning of the respective transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,449,LIABILITIES,449.164,Financial covenants,449.164.1,,The Company’s factoring agreements are subject to financial covenants. For two factoring agreements the financial covenant consist of the tangible net worth ratio based on the audited annual consolidated financial statements. The tangible net worth ratio shall be equal to or greater than 0.18 with the tangible net worth being equal or greater than EUR 500 million. The tangible net worth ratio is calculated as follows (A) divided by (B) whereas (A) is tangible net worth and (B) is balance sheet total. Tangible net worth means share capital plus reserves (including retained earnings) plus minority interests minus (plus (if a negative figure)) cash flow hedge reserve minus intangible assets (excluding licenses). The balance sheet total means balance sheet total minus (plus (if a negative figure)) cash flow hedge reserve) minus intangible assets (excluding licenses). Based on the audited annual consolidated financial statements the tangible net worth ratio amounted to 0.23 in 2018 (2017: 0.55). The tangible net worth amounted to EUR 521 million (2017: EUR 1.3 billion). Consequently the financial covenant for the respective factoring agreements have been met for 2018 and 2017. For another factoring agreement a different set of financial covenant applies. The financial covenant of this factoring agreement is based on the Company’s unaudited quarterly financial statements for DT group reporting purposes. The financial covenant is reported to the respective bank on a quarterly basis. The financial covenant for this factoring agreement consists of: - The intra-group funding is at least EUR 300 million; - The equity ratio may not fall below 20%; - The leverage factor may not exceed 4.0.

IFRS 9 requires the company to recognize an allowance for ECLs for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss and contract assets. The Group recognized additional impairment on the Company’s trade receivables of € 0.6 million and which resulted in a decrease in equity as at 1 January 2018. Further, pursuant the initial application of IFRS 15, the Group recorded a credit loss allowance on contract assets in the amount of € 1,2 million as at 1 January 2018. Reference is made to Note 32.4 for additional information. Effects may arise in ongoing application from a change in business developments (for example, changes in volumes or prices) or from changes to business models where these are reflected in the amounts reported for long term trade receivables and contract assets. The Group has three types of financial assets that are subject to IFRS 9 new expected credit loss model: — Cash and cash equivalents — Trade and other receivables — Intercompany receivables Cash and cash equivalents are considered to have a low impairment risk as these are current assets valued at market value based on day-to-day exchange rates. No impairment risk is identified with regard to cash and cash equivalents. The trade receivables which are not factored are analyzed for the expected credit loss. The main trigger for the expected credit loss is the default of the customer. To value this default risk T-Mobile adjusts the valuation of the receivable for the average expected credit loss. The expected credit loss on intercompany receivables is considered immaterial.

The structured entity has no other business activities than the purchase or sale of trade receivables or other investments. The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the sold receivables are based on the credit risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). As of reporting date the credit risk represents substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables and is transferred in full to the buyer. The maximum credit risk to be borne by T-Mobile in a worst-case scenario amounts to EUR 3.5 million (2019: EUR 4.0 million) as of the reporting date. The other credit risk-related losses would be borne by the buyer. The late-payment risk continues to be borne in full by T-Mobile. The maximum exposure to loss for T-Mobile resulting from credit risk and late-payment risk relating to the receivables sold at the reporting date is EUR 3.5 million (2019: EUR 4.0 million). According to the risk assessment substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables were transferred to the buyer as of reporting date. The expected loss resulting from the late-payment risk recognized under financial liabilities represents T-Mobile’s entire continuing involvement; the carrying amount and fair value each amounted to less than EUR 100 thousand. In 2019 the agreement was reported as a factoring transaction involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards, according to the then risk assessment, with control remaining at T-Mobile. The accounting treatment changed in 2020 due to an increase of credit risk transferred. T-Mobile continues to perform servicing for the receivables sold.

In 2019 the transaction was reported as a factoring agreement involving the splitting of significant risks and rewards with control transferred to the buyers resulting in a full derecognition of receivables sold. In a regular review process of the derecognition requirements in 2020 T-Mobile assessed that bank does not have the practical ability to resell the receivables anymore and consequently T-Mobile remains control over the receivables. The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the receivables sold are the credit risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk).

If the buyer agrees to purchase receivables beyond this amount, the purchase price payment shall be deferred until the maximum program volume decreases again by the corresponding amount. With this structure, there is no structured entity consolidated by T-Mobile. Rather, the receivables are sold directly to a structured entity that is not consolidated by T-Mobile due to the lack of ability to direct the entity’s relevant activities. This structured entity holds the receivables and allocates the risks and rewards resulting from these to T-Mobile and a bank on the basis of contractual arrangements. The structured entity is financed through the issue of commercial paper to third parties outside T-Mobile or, alternatively, through a credit facility provided by a bank. The receivables are purchased in an automated process based on the purchase criteria set out in the receivables purchase agreement. T-Mobile is obligated to buy back aged receivables and receivables for which a write-down is imminent at nominal value. The cash flows resulting from the buybacks would occur in the month following the buy-back. Such buybacks of receivables would not affect the allocation of the credit risk-related losses in any way, as the latter would be passed back to the buyers in line with the agreed risk allocation. The nominal volume of the receivables sold by T-Mobile and not yet settled by the debtors was EUR 46.0 million (2019: EUR 47.9 million) as of the reporting date. The structured entity has no other business activities than the purchase or sale of trade receivables or other investments. The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the sold receivables are based on the credit risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk). The maximum credit risk to be borne by T-Mobile amounts to EUR 2.6 million (2019: EUR 2.7 million) as of the reporting date. The other credit riskrelated losses are borne by the buyers. The late-payment risk continues to be borne in full by T-Mobile. The maximum exposure to loss for T-Mobile resulting from credit risk and late-payment risk relating to the receivables sold at the reporting date is EUR 2.6 million (2019: EUR 2.7 million). Substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables were neither transferred nor retained (allocation of the material risks and rewards between T-Mobile and the buyers). T-Mobile continues to perform servicing for the receivables sold. Under the factoring agreement the buyer (structured entity)has the right to transfer the servicing to third parties for no specific reason. Although T-Mobile is not authorized to use the receivables sold other than in its capacity as servicer, it retains control over the receivables sold because the buyers and the structured entities do not have the practical ability to resell the purchased receivables. At the time the receivables are sold, the fair value of the expected losses is expensed. Expected future payments are presented as a component of the associated liability. In transactions with structured entities, certain portions of the purchase price are initially held back and, depending on the amount of the actual defaults, are only paid to T-Mobile at a later date. To the extent that such portions of the purchase price are expected to be received in the future, they are recognized at fair value. T-Mobile continues to recognize the trade receivables sold to the extent of its continuing involvement, i.e. in the maximum amount with which it is still liable for the credit risk and late-payment risk inherent in the receivables sold, and recognizes a corresponding associated liability presented in liabilities to banks. The receivables and the associated liability are then derecognized in the extent to which T-Mobile’s continuing involvement is reduced (particularly when payment is made by the customer). The carrying amount of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the extent to which the actual losses to be borne by T-Mobile resulting from the credit risk and the late-payment risk exceed the losses initially expected. This amount is recognized as an expense. T-Mobile’s continuing involvement as of 31 December 2020 amounted to EUR 2.6 million (2019: EUR 2.6 million), and the carrying amount of the associated liability was EUR 2.6 million (2019: EUR 2.7 million).

A factoring transaction is in place under which banks are required to purchase trade receivables. The receivables sold entail charges from sales of handsets payable over a period of up to two years. The factoring agreement has a maximum funding amount of EUR 90 million. The purchase price will be paid out immediately upon sale. On 5 December 2019 the term of this factoring transaction has been extended for another two (2) years to 30 June 2021. The risks relevant for the risk assessment with respect to the receivables sold are the credit risk and the risk of late payments (late-payment risk).

In one receivables portfolio, the receivables are purchased in an automated process based on the purchase criteria set out in the receivables purchase agreement.

On 1 April 2021, the Group signed a long-term agreement to become an anchor tenant on the fiber network to be rolled out by Open Dutch Fiber, a newly established company owner by investment funds KKR and DTCP.(hereafter ‘MSA’). As per this agreement, the Group commits to a long-term agreement to utilize the fiber Infrastructure and warrant a minimum set of payments to the lessor. The MSA only provides a framework / general terms for the Cluster Agreements (CA) that T-Mobile will conclude with the lessor. The CAs set out the details per cluster (area) such as object, commencement date, cluster specifics, charges and payments. Pursuant to the provisions of the MSA/CA, the initial lease term begins on the date on which the relevant cluster is ready for service. Hence, the Group commits to lease the fiber Infrastructure within a cluster and commit to a minimum usage to the lessor as per the date that the subcluster is ready for service. As per the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue, no subclusters are ready for service, which entails that the Group does not yet have a financial commitment, however subclusters will be delivered during the course of 2021 and beyond, which will have a material impact on the financial statements. The Group expects the first subcluster to be ready for service by the end of September 2021. In 2018, a Dutch governmental Taskforce started a risk assessment on 5G security. November 2019 ”Besluit veiligheid en integriteit telecommunicatie”—AMVB is established. In April 2021 T-Mobile received an individual classified decision stating which components should be of a trusted vendor. A transition period is granted. The Group will use this transition period to replace the concerning components. The estimated investment required to replace the concerning components and is included in business plans. Since the beginning of 2019 US regulation has impacted the supply chain for spare parts and execution of services. Actions have been established to ensure continuity both on a spare part level and to bring the execution of services in line with the US regulation. F-88 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

The new regulations cover the classification of financial assets on the basis of the underlying business models and the cash flow characteristics of the instruments. Under the new provisions on the accounting of impairment losses, expected losses have to be recognized on initial recognition. In addition, the requirements apply not only to debt instruments, but also to contract assets pursuant to IFRS 15. Among other things, the new rules for reporting hedge relationships provide the option of recognizing hedging costs separately in other comprehensive income (OCI). 1 January 2018 This standard provides a single, principles-based five-step model for the determination and recognition of revenue to be applied to all contracts with customers. It replaces in particular IAS 18 and IAS 11. When applying IFRS 15 for the first time, an entity shall apply the standard in full for the current period. In respect of prior periods, the transition guidance grants entities an option to either apply IFRS 15 in full to prior periods (with certain limited practical expedients being available) or to retain priorperiod figures as reported under the F-176 previous standards, recognizing the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 15 to all contracts that had not yet been completed at the beginning of the reporting period as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at the date of first-time adoption (beginning of current reporting period). 1 January 2018 Mandatory adoption of IFRS 15 for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 1 January 2018 The clarifications address the following topics relating to IFRS 15: – Identification of performance obligations (when a promised good or service is distinct from other promises in the contract). – Differentiation of principalagent relationships, application guidance on the concept of the transfer of control in the case of services provided by third parties. – Clarification of the conditions for the timing of recognition of revenue arising from the licensing of intellectual property.

In the interim, such entities are thus subject to the provisions of IAS 39. In the case of F-177 ----- designated financial assets, other entities falling within the scope of IFRS 4 may incur differences in values depending on whether these assets are to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 or IAS 39; these differences must be presented in other comprehensive income instead of in profit or loss. 1 January 2018 IFRIC 22 clarifies what exchange rate is to be applied on initial recognition of a foreign-currency transaction in an entity’s functional currency in cases where the entity receives or pays advance consideration before the related asset, expense or income is recognized. The exchange rate for the underlying asset, expense or income is taken as that prevailing on the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary prepayment asset or deferred income liability",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

Application of this standard is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard introduces new classification and measurement requirements for financial instruments and replaces, in particular, IAS 39. The Group applies IFRS 9 prospectively, with an initial application date of 1 January 2018. The cumulative effect arising from the transition is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity in the year of initial application. TMNL has not restated the comparative information, which continues to be reported under IAS 39. Under IFRS 9, financial assets that are debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, amortized cost, or fair value through other comprehensive income. The classification is based on two criteria: the Group’s business model for managing the assets; and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding. F-178 ----- The assessment of the company’s business model was made as of the date of initial application, 1 January 2018. The assessment of whether contractual cash flows on debt instruments are solely comprised of principal and interest was made based on the facts and circumstances as at the initial recognition of the assets. As described in Note 32.9, the Group is party to factoring agreements under which it sells portfolios its trade receivables on a revolving basis. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group designated these receivables as either at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. The measurement of debt instruments – especially trade receivables held for potential sale – at fair value had minor effects at the transition date. Effects may arise in ongoing application, particularly from changes in the volumes of receivables held for potential sale in the future. The Group has not designated any financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss. There are no changes in classification and measurement for the company’s financial liabilities. The following table shows the effect of adopting IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2018 for each individual line item.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ of our report.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board of management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the board of management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The board of management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. ### Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may not detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report, we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves. ### The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following: - Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control. - Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. - Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of management. - Concluding on the appropriateness of the board of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary. We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. _T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. - DWNCNXMPWEQQ-1010849602-138_ Page 4 of 4 F-93 ----- The independent auditor’s report of PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. is presented on the next pages.

Furthermore, we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). ## Report on the other information included in the annual report In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of: - the management board report; - the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information: - is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; - contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. The board of management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the directors’ report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. _T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. YKZKP7SKFQWC-1820324480-97_ Page 2 of 4 F-165 ----- ## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit ### Responsibilities of the board of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements The board of management is responsible for: - the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for - such internal control as the board of management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board of management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the board of management should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the board of management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The board of management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. ### Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may not detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report. Rotterdam, 31 December 2020 PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. P. van der Maarel RA _The above auditor’s report is the original auditor’s report that was issued on 31 December 2020 with respect to the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019.These financial statements also contained the company financial statements. For purposes of the Offering Memorandum the company financial statements have been omitted. Furthermore, the above auditor’s report refers to other information included in the annual report, being the management board report and the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code,which is not included in the Offering Memorandum. T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. YKZKP7SKFQWC-1820324480-97_ Page 3 of 4 F-166 ----- ## Appendix to our auditor’s report on the financial statements 2019 of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report, we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves. ### The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following: - Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control. - Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. - Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of management. - Concluding on the appropriateness of the board of management’s use of the goingconcern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary. We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. _T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V.

(hereafter: ‘Tele2 Netherlands’) by T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. (hereafter: ‘T-Mobile Netherlands’). After the European Commission issued its approval without conditions on November 27, 2018, the transaction was consummated on January 2, 2019. Tele2 Netherlands has been included in T-Mobile Netherlands’s consolidated financial statements as a fully consolidated subsidiary since the acquisition date. The enlarged company continues to operate as T- Mobile Netherlands and will also use the Tele2 brand name in the Dutch telecom market. This transaction will establish a stronger, more sustainable provider of convergent fixed network and mobile services on the Dutch market. The revenue and profit and loss of the acquiree are since the acquisition date included in the consolidated financial statement of comprehensive income in the reporting period. As the technical merger is realized within the ERP system under the same company code together with T-Mobile Netherlands it is technically impracticable to separate these data. Tele2 Sverige AB received a purchase price in the form of a 25 percent stake in T-Mobile Netherlands and a cash component of EUR 199 million. Deutsche Telekom maintains 75% of the shares in T-Mobile Netherlands. The purchase price allocation and the measurement of Tele2 Netherlands’ assets and liabilities at the acquisition date were finalized as of December 31, 2019. The cash consideration transferred amounts to EUR 199 million plus the stake of Tele2 Sverige AB of 25% in T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. valued at EUR 759 million (in total EUR 958 million). The purchase consideration for the acquisition of the Tele2 business was calculated based on the business plan of the enlarged company, applying the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, and taking synergies into account. Synergies in the business plan included direct costs synergies attributable to the fixed part of the business, market invest synergies attributable to the mobile part of the business, and operating expenditures synergies include synergies related to all categories, i.e. workforce, network, marketing, and other costs. All synergies were assumed to be available to an average market participant. Acquisition related costs amounting to EUR 1.6M were expensed as incurred in the financial year 2019 (2018: EUR 0.6M) and disclosed in the consolidated income statement within the other operating expenses.

Going forward, lessees will therefore no longer be required to make the distinction between finance and operating leases that was required in the past in accordance with IAS 17. For all leases, the lessee will recognize a lease liability in its statement of financial position for the obligation to make future lease payments. At the same time, the lessee will capitalize a right of use to the underlying asset which is equivalent to the present value of the future lease payments plus initial direct costs, directly attributable expenditure, advance payments and restoration costs, as well as less incentive payments received. Similar to the guidance on finance leases in IAS 17, the lease liability will be adjusted over the lease term for any remeasurement, while the right-of-use asset will be depreciated, which in contrast to the current lease expense normally leads to higher expenses at the inception date of a lease. For the lessor, on the other hand, the provisions of the new standard are similar to the existing guidance in IAS 17. IFRS 16 also includes new provisions on the definition of a lease and its presentation, on disclosures in the notes, and on sale and leaseback transactions. F-106",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,460,"2.4** **NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP",460.5,To be applied from** **Changes,460.5.1,,"1 January The amendment sets out 2019 that, if certain conditions are met, financial assets can be measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income if, in the case of an early termination, compensation is required to be paid to the party that triggers the early termination of the contract. 1 January The amendments clarify that 2019 an entity applies IFRS 9 including its impairment requirements to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture but are not accounted for using the equity method. 1 January The guidance on the 2019 amendment, curtailment, or settlement of a defined benefit pension plan has been changed as follows: Clarification that an entity is required to determine current service cost and the net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after a plan amendment, curtailment, or settlement using updated actuarial assumptions and the net liability (or net asset) at the time of the intervention. Any changes in a surplus must be recognized as profit or loss as part of past service cost, or a gain or loss on settlement, even if this surplus had not been previously disclosed due to the effect of the asset ceiling. The effects of changes in the asset ceiling are recognized in other comprehensive income. F-107 ----- 1 January The interpretation explains 2019 how to recognize and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. Annual Improvements Project Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle 1 January Clarification of many No material impact. 2019 published standards. The Group applied for the first time the new IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ accounting standard as well as certain amendments to the standards, which are effective on 1 January 2019. The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective. The nature and the impact of the amendments that have a material impact on the presentation of the Group’s result of operations and financial positions are disclosed in this section below. The IFRS 16 standard is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 has a material effect on T-Mobile’s consolidated financial statements, particularly on total assets, the results of operations, cash generated from operations, net cash from/used for financing activities, and the presentation of the financial position. The new regulations affect T-Mobile as a lessee especially in relation to leases of cell sites (land, space in cell towers, or rooftop surface areas), network infrastructure, and buildings used for administrative or technical purposes. T-Mobile has not applied the new lease standard retrospectively in the transition to IFRS 16 and therefore applied the modified retrospective method. The new standard requires payment obligations from existing operating leases to be discounted and recognized as lease liabilities; as financial liabilities, they increase net debt. At the same time, the lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset. Operating expenses previously recognized in connection with operating leases are now recognized in depreciation charges on right-of-use assets and in interest expenses for discounted obligations from operating leases, as appropriate. This significantly increases EBITDA without any attendant change in the economic circumstances. In the statement of cash flows, the principal repayment portion of the lease payments from existing operating leases reduces net cash from/used in financing activities and no longer affects net cash from operating activities. The interest portion of the payments remains in net cash from operating activities and thus also in free cash flow. The Group has not applied the new lease standard retrospectively in full, but makes use of the exemption provisions for lessees, also known as the modified retrospective method. On the transition to IFRS 16, remaining payment obligations from existing operating leases are discounted using the relevant incremental borrowing rate and recognized as a lease liability and the right-of-use assets were carried as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The incremental borrowing rate of interest is determined by deriving benchmark interest rates for a period of up to 30 years from maturityrelated risk-free interest rates which are increased by a credit-risk premium and adjusted for a liquidity and country-risk premium and also adjusted for the security related premium. Weighted average incremental borrowing rates of 1.1 to 3.5 percent were applied to lease liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position as of 1 January 2019. For the lease liabilities related to the master lease agreement with T-Mobile Infra B.V., the rate implicit in the lease is 8.5 percent. F-108 ----- In the statement of cash flows, the repayment portion of the lease payments from existing operating leases will reduce net cash from/used in financing activities and no longer affect net cash from operating activities. Only the interest payments will remain in net cash from operating activities, By applying the modified retrospective approach practical expedients are exercised as follows: - The recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements of IFRS 16 also applied to shortterm leases and leases of low value assets; - Existing contracts will not be grandfathered. On January 1, 2019, IFRS 16 was therefore applied to all existing leases falling within its scope. It applies to contracts in which T-Mobile is a lessee; - A single discount rate is applied to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics; - Non-lease components are generally not separated from lease components; instead, each lease component and any associated non-lease components is accounted for as a single lease component. This principle does not include contracts relating to data centers, which due to their special requirements in terms of equipment and premises form their own separate class of underlying asset. For this class of underlying assets, the non-lease payments are recognized as an expense; - IAS 37 is applied immediately before the date of initial application for onerous leases; - Initial direct costs are excluded from the measurement of the right of use asset at the date of initial application; - Provisions for onerous contracts recognized in connection with leases were adjusted against the right-of-use asset as of January 1, 2019; - In determining the lease term, hindsight may be used where economic considerations and penalties indicate that it is reasonably certain that options to extend or terminate the lease will be exercised. In addition, on the date of first-time adoption of IFRS 16 use was made of the main policy elections as follows: - Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented separately in the statement of financial position; - IAS 38 is applied for leases of intangible assets rather than IFRS 16. The Group is not required to make any adjustments on transition to IFRS 16 for leases in which it acts as a lessor, except for a sub-lease. T-Mobile assessed the classification of the sub-lease contracts with reference to the right-of-use asset and concluded that they are finance leases under IFRS 16. The finance leases relate to the sublease of sites. T-Mobile is a party to framework site sharing agreements. The framework site sharing agreements are reciprocal and set for an indefinite time period. Parties to the framework site sharing agreements need the space on the other parties’ sites whereby the reciprocity ascertains that parties will make their sites available to the other party. As per 1 September 2018, the sites subject to the framework site sharing agreements were demerged to T-Mobile Infra B.V. As per 1 September 2018, T-Mobile and T-Mobile Infra concluded a master lease agreement for a minimum period of 15 years whereby T-Mobile leases the passive infrastructure and space on T-Mobile Infra sites. T-Mobile remained principal to the framework site sharing agreements. As at 1 January 2019, T-Mobile recognizes a receivable in the amount of the net investment in the lease for a period of 15 years resulting from subleases related to above mentioned site sharing agreements. The lease payments made by the lessees are split into an interest component and a principal component. The rate implicit in these leases is 8.5%. As at 1 January 2019, a net gain of EUR 21.8 million was recognized in equity as the difference between the net investment in the lease of the amount of EUR 47.1 million and the carrying amount of EUR 18.0 million of the relevant portion of the underlying assets net of deferred tax in the amount of EUR 7.3 million. F-109 ----- The adjustments made to the consolidated statement of financial position as of 1 January 2019 and attributable to the first-time application of IFRS 16 are as follows: - The increase in right-of-use assets amounts to EUR 510.2 million. - Increase in the net investment of the lease amounting to EUR 47.1 million. - With relation to prepayments and accruals, right-of-use assets decreased by EUR 8.5 million (Total right-of-use assets 501.7 million). - The increase in lease liabilities amounts to EUR 510.2 million. - The increase in lease liabilities leads to a corresponding increase in net debt. - The decrease in property, plant and equipment due to reclassification from finance leases amounts to EUR 0.1 million.

As per 1 September 2018, 3,139 sites were transferred from T-Mobile Netherlands B.V. to T-Mobile Infra B.V. The respective lease liabilities were part of the operating leases as per 31 December 2018. The lease liabilities in the amount of EUR 295.4 million were recognized as opening balance for the IFRS 16 transition accounting. As per 1 January 2019 T-Mobile Infra was deconsolidated outside the consolidation area of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V., resulting into a derecognition of the lease liabilities of EUR 295.4 million. Instead T-Mobile has lease agreement with T-Mobile Infra B.V. for the 3,139 sites. This lease liability amounts to EUR 434.5 million as per 1 January 2019. The difference in the amount (EUR 295.4 million) compared to the new lease liability (EUR 434.5 million) mainly results from the fact that in addition to these sites the passive network equipment on these sites as well as additional services are also agreed upon in the lease arrangement with T-Infra. Furthermore, the lease arrangement with Infra also includes a mark-up for the transfer of the price risk on these sites and equipment to Infra.

Control only exists if an investor has the power over the investee, is exposed to variable returns, and is able to use power to affect its amount of variable returns. The existence and effect of substantive potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible, including potential voting rights held by other Group companies, are considered when assessing whether an entity is controlled. All subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. Income and expenses of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. Income and expenses of a subsidiary remain included in the consolidated financial statements until the date on which the parent ceases to control the subsidiary. If necessary, the subsidiaries’ accounting principles are aligned with the uniform accounting principles applied by the Group. Intercompany income and expenses, receivables and liabilities, and profits or losses are eliminated. Upon loss of control, a gain or loss from the disposal of the subsidiary is recognized in the consolidated income statement in the amount of the difference between the (I) proceeds from the disposal of the subsidiary, the fair value of the remaining shares, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests, and the cumulative amounts of other comprehensive income attributable to the subsidiary, and (II) the carrying amount of the subsidiary’s net assets to be disposed of. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group. F-111 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,461,2.5.2 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,461.1,,461.1.1,,"A business combination exists when the Group obtains control of another entity. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The cost of an acquired subsidiary is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, comprising the: - the fair values of the assets transferred - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business - equity interest issued by the Group - fair value of any asset and liability resulting from contingent consideration arrangement, and - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary The identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized in full at their fair values at the acquisition date, regardless of the level of the investment held by the Group. The Group recognized any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill arising in a business combination is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the cost of acquisition, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and in a business combination achieved in stages, the fair value of the equity interest held by T-Mobile in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date over the fair value of the net assets acquired. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. Any difference arising on the revaluation of equity interests previously held by T-Mobile is recognized in profit or loss. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date.

Furthermore, the Group is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubts upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. **2.8** **THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OUR BUSINESS** The COVID-19 outbreak has developed rapidly in many countries in the world including the Netherlands. The measures taken to contain the virus have affected the economic activities globally. However, the consequences of the COVID-19 outspread and measures taken by the government have not materially affected the supply and demand for the Company’s primary services. Therefore, its operating results and cash flows from operations have not been negatively impacted subsequently, and the company has sufficient liquidity. T-Mobile has taken several measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 within the company. Retail shops were closed as from 16 March 2020 and reopened again in June, taking into account necessary safety measures for our employees and customers. As of 15 December 2020, government has issued new measures to cope with COVID-19. Based on the new measures T-Mobile has closed its shops. 40 shops will remain open for service activities only. The new measures are in place until at least 19 January 2021. We have implemented a working from home policy and enabled our employees to work from home in the best possible way. Our networks are stable and can currently cope well with the additional volume caused by increased numbers of people working from home. Based on the facts and circumstances known at this moment and the possible scenarios about how the COVID-19 virus and resulting government measures could evolve, management has determined that, whilst uncertain, we do not believe, however, that the impact of the COVD-19 virus would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.

Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services, current replacement costs, prices paid in comparable transactions, and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists. The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows, applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values. Specifically, the estimation of cash flows underlying the fair values from the mobile business considers the continued investment in network infrastructure required to generate future revenue growth through the offering of new data products and services, for which only limited historical information on customer demand is available. If the demand for these products and services does not materialize as expected, this would result in less revenue, less cash flow, and potential impairment.

Methods used to calculate the recoverable amount include discounted cash flowbased methods and methods that use market prices as a basis. The measurements based on discounted cash flows are founded on projections that are based on financial plans that have been approved by management and are also used for internal purposes. The planning horizon selected reflects the assumptions for short- to medium-term market developments and is selected to achieve a steady state in the business outlook that is necessary for calculating the perpetual annuity. This steady state is only reached based on the planning horizon selected, in particular due to the sometimes long investment cycles in the telecommunications industry and the investments planned and expected in the long run to acquire and extend the rights of spectrum use. Cash flows beyond the internal mid-term planning are extrapolated using appropriate growth rates. The key assumptions on which management has based its calculation of the recoverable amount include the following assumptions that were primarily derived from internal sources and are based on past experience as well as internal expectations, and that are underscored by external market data and estimates: development of revenue, customer acquisition and retention costs, churn rates, capital expenditure, market share, and growth rates. Discount rates are determined based on external figures derived from the market, taking account of the risks associated with the cash-generating unit.

Judgment is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the final settlement. Provisions are recognized for losses from executory contracts, provided a loss is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated.

Gross versus net presentation: For assessment of gross or net presentation of revenues, the Company has assessed its customer contracts and has determined that it acts as a principal in all its contracts with customers. The Company has also assessed that revenues from handsets sold by indirect partners must be presented net, since the indirect partners are the principals in selling the handsets. The revenues from the other contract components from these indirect sales, e.g. service and connection fees are presented gross, since the company is the principal for these products and services. The standalone selling prices of individual products or services that are part of multiple-element arrangements are complex to determine, because some of the elements are price-sensitive and, thus, volatile in a competitive marketplace. In many cases, standalone selling prices can also not be observed for the company’s own products. Due to the fact that comparability is generally not completely assured, the use of market prices for similar products is subject to an element of uncertainty, as is an estimate using a cost-plus-margin approach. Changes in estimates of standalone selling prices can significantly influence the allocation of the transaction price for the entire multipleelement arrangement among the individual performance obligations and therefore affect both the financial position, i.e., the carrying amount of contract assets and contract liabilities, and the current and future results of operations. Contract costs are recognized as an expense and amortized on a systematic basis over the expected duration of the customer relationship. The estimate of the expected average duration of customer retention is based on historical customer turnover. However, this is subject to fluctuations and has only limited informative value with regard to future customer behavior, particularly if new products are rolled out. If management’s estimates are revised, material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for subsequent periods. The significance of material rights is an estimate that is based on both quantitative and qualitative factors. This is ultimately a matter of judgment, even though it is supported by quantitative facts. Depending on the decision as to whether or not the customer has a material right to be deferred, there may be material differences in the amount and timing of revenues for the current and subsequent periods.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,477,2.11.6 JUDGMENTS: EXTENSION AND TERMINATION OPTIONS FOR THE LESSEE,477.1,,477.1.1,,"In determining the term of leases of cell site space, land/ground, office buildings, and retail stores, which are the most relevant lease contracts in the Group, the following are the most relevant factors that are considered: - Rapidly advancing and ever-changing technology in the telecommunications industry requires flexible lease contracts, i.e., management tries to minimize longer periods during which the contracts cannot be canceled. - When determining whether an extension of a lease contract is reasonably certain, in addition to any significant penalties for terminating (or not extending) the lease, business plans and the business model are considered, e.g., cost/benefit analysis, consolidation plans for the mobile network and office facilities, new mobile network standards, significance of the property for the underlying operations, replacement or usage of additional technology, as well as the availability and cost of alternative locations. - Often leasehold improvements can also be used in alternative locations. In many cases, the costs of moving or replacing the asset or initial construction costs are not the main factor considered when determining whether to extend or not to extend the lease. - Significant investments made in a location, e.g., construction of towers and masts on the leased land, are economic penalties typically considered when determining the lease term. After having considered all of the factors above, for cell site contracts the Group concluded that it is not reasonably certain that an option to extend the lease term beyond the initial non-cancelable lease term will be exercised. For cell site contracts—including the land/ground underneath the infrastructure, the lease term of on average 7 years is considered reasonably certain depending on the significance of the leasehold improvement. Extension options after that period are typically not considered reasonably certain at commencement of the lease. Payments associated with these optional periods are not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities. Most extension options for office and shop leases are not included in the lease liability because T-Mobile could replace the leased assets without significant cost or business disruption. Exposure to future additional cash outflows will only arise when an extension option (not determined to be reasonably certain) is exercised or when a termination option (determined to be reasonably certain) is not exercised. After the commencement date, the assessment of a reasonable certainty exercise is only reassessed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs that affects this judgment, and this is within the control of the lessee. T-Mobile reassesses the lease term when an option is exercised (or not exercised) or it becomes obligated to exercise (or not exercise). The cell site lease with T-Mobile Infra B.V. has an initial non-cancelable period of 15 years, during which the lease cannot be terminated. The initial period of time is followed by two renewal periods of ten years each (optional renewal period) and another unlimited numbers of further renewal periods of ten years each (additional renewal) if not terminated. T-Mobile has the right to terminate after the initial term and before each optional and additional renewal, and Infra after the first additional renewal period. T-Mobile’s termination rights after the initial lease term and the after the two optional renewal periods, are options to extend the lease. This means that the non-cancelable period ends when T-Mobile can exercise its termination right, and for any following periods T-Mobile has effectively an option to extend, i.e. a unilateral right not to terminate the contract. As a consequence, management of T-Mobile had to assess for what periods it is reasonably certain that it does not exercise the option and will thereby not extend the contract beyond the non-cancellable period. Management came to the conclusion that it is not reasonably certain that the option to renew the lease after the non-cancelable lease term of 15 years will be exercised. Therefore, the lease term under the application of IFRS 16 is deemed to be 15 years. This is in line with the strategically horizon of T-Mobile. In determining the lease term, management applies judgment and considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for T-Mobile to exercise an extension option, or not to F-118 ----- exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if T-Mobile is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. The threshold for a “reasonably certain” exercise is lower than “virtually certain” and higher than “more likely than not” under IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent Assets.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit must be determined. In addition, annual impairment tests are carried out for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill) at a yearly basis. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the F-121 ----- carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit must be reduced in the amount of the difference.

If the reasons for previously recognized impairments no longer exist, the impairment losses on the assets concerned (with the exception of goodwill) must be reversed. The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The recoverable amount is generally determined by means of a discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation, unless it can be determined on the basis of a market price. These DCF calculations use projections that are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a ten-year period and are also used for internal purposes.

For this to be the case, the assets and liabilities must be available for immediate distribution in their present condition and the distribution must be highly probable. For the distribution to be highly probable, actions to complete the distribution must have been initiated and should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.

Provisions are recognized for these obligations provided they relate to past transactions or events, will probably require an outflow of resources to settle, and this outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions are carried at their expected settlement amount, taking into account all identifiable risks and uncertainties. The settlement amount is calculated on the basis of a best estimate; suitable estimation methods and sources of information are used depending on the characteristics of the obligation. In case of a number of similar obligations, the Group of obligations is treated as one single obligation. The expected value method is used as the estimation method. If there is a range of potential events with the same probability of occurrence, the average value is taken. Individual obligations (e.g., legal and litigation risks) are regularly evaluated based on the most probable outcome, provided an exceptional probability distribution does not mean that other estimates would lead to a more appropriate evaluation. The measurement of provisions is based on past experience, current costing and price information, as well as estimates and reports from experts. If experience or current costing or price information is used to determine the settlement amount, these values are extrapolated to the expected settlement date. Suitable price trend indicators (e.g., construction price indexes or inflation rates) are used for this purpose. Provisions are discounted for the time value of money. Provisions are discounted using pre-tax market interest rates that reflect the term of the obligation and the risk associated with it (insofar as not already taken into consideration in the calculation of the settlement amount). Reimbursement claims are not netted against provisions; they are recognized separately as soon as their realization is virtually certain.

Changes at a later date in estimates of the amount or timing of payments or changes to the interest rate applied in measuring such obligations also result in retrospective increases or decreases in the carrying amount of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. These in turn change the depreciation of the asset to be recognized in the future, which leads to the changes in estimates being recognized in profit or loss over the remaining useful life.

In general, financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the entity currently has a right to offset the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis. Transferred financial assets are derecognized in full if substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred or if some of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred (risk sharing) and the acquirer has both the legal and the practical ability to sell the assets to a third party. If, in cases where risk is shared, the acquirer is unable to sell the assets to a third party, the assets will continue to be recognized to the extent of the maximum risk retained.

Contingent liabilities are also present obligations that arise from past events for which an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are only recognized at their fair value if they were assumed in the course of a business combination. Contingent liabilities not assumed in the course of a business combination are not recognized. Contingent assets are not recognized. However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is no longer a contingent asset, but it is recognized as an asset. Information on contingent liabilities is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. The same applies to contingent assets where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,490,2.12.14 LEASES,490.1,a) Lessee,490.1.1,,"At the commencement date, a right-of-use asset measured at cost and a lease liability measured at the present value of the future lease payments must be recognized in the statement of financial position for all leases. This also applies to leases for which the underlying asset is of low value and to short-term leases (lease term of no more than twelve months). Non-lease components are not separated from lease components, i.e., all non-lease payments due under the contract are also recognized in the statement of financial position. This principle does not include contracts relating to data centers, which due to their special requirements in terms of equipment and premises form their own separate class of underlying asset. For this class of underlying assets, the non-lease payments are recognized as an expense. The lease liability is recognized at the present value of the future lease payments over the reasonably certain period of use. Lease payments are all fixed and in-substance payments, less any future lease incentives payable by the lessor. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, expected payments under residual value guarantees, and payments for reasonably certain purchase and termination options are also recognized. The series of payments is discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. All other variable payments are recognized as an expense. The lease liability is measured using the effective interest method and adjusted. The cost of the right-of-use asset is determined as the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred for obtaining the lease, the costs of installing the leased asset, and an estimate of any future restoration costs, less any lease incentives received from the lessor. In subsequent measurement, the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and, if applicable, adjusted for any impairment losses. If ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term, or if it is reasonably certain that a purchase or sale option will exist, the right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. The lease term is the period in which it is reasonably certain that an asset will be leased. In addition to the non-cancelable period of a lease, extensions will be included if their exercise is reasonably certain at the commencement of the lease term. This estimate is only to be reassessed upon occurrence of an event that necessitates a change. The lease term will be revised if an extension option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term is exercised or a termination option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term is not exercised. The adjustment of the lease term leads to a change in the future series of payments and therefore to remeasurement of the lease liability using a market rate of interest. The difference is recognized outside profit or loss as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset. Amounts derecognized that exceed the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset are recognized as an expense in profit or loss. A lease modification that substantially increases the scope of the original lease is accounted for as a separate lease if the lessee is granted an additional right to use one or more underlying assets and the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope that the lessee would otherwise have to pay for use if it had leased these assets from a third party under a separate lease. Lease modifications that increase the scope of the lease but do not lead to the recognition of a separate lease are recognized outside profit or loss as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability for the existing lease. If a lease modification decreases the scope of the lease, the lessee must remeasure both the right-of-use asset and the lease liability and recognize any gain or loss on a pro-rata basis in profit or loss. The modified leases are measured at the modification date with the new, applicable interest rate. In cash flow statement, the Group has classified cash payments for leases as financing activities consistent with the presentation of interest payments chosen by the Group.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,490,2.12.14 LEASES,490.2,b) Lessor,490.2.1,,"If substantially all risks and rewards are attributable to the lessor (operating lease), the leased asset is recognized in the statement of financial position by the lessor. Measurement of the leased asset is then based on the accounting policies applicable to that asset. The lease payments are recognized in profit or loss by the lessor. Contractually defined future changes in the lease payments during the term of the lease are recognized as revenue from leases on a straight-line basis over the entire lease term, which is defined only once at the inception date of the contract. Where extension options exist, the exercise of those extension options that are reasonably certain is initially taken into account at the time the lease is concluded. If, contrary to the original expectation, these options are exercised or not exercised during the lease term, the estimated term will be adjusted and taken into account in the calculation of future lease revenue from operating lease transactions. If substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset are attributable to the lessee (finance lease), the lessor recognizes at the commencement date, in place of the leased asset, a finance lease receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The net investment in the lease is defined as the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the unearned finance income. The lease payments made by the lessees are split into an interest component and a principal component using the effective interest method. In subsequent measurement, the lease receivable is reduced by the principal received. The interest component of the payments received is recognized as finance income in the income statement. For sale and leaseback transactions, if there is a transfer of control within the meaning of IFRS 15, T-Mobile as the seller-lessee measures the asset at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the lessor is recognized in profit or loss as the selling profit or loss. If there is no transfer of control, the transaction is recognized as a financing transaction.

641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,492,"2.12.16 NET REVENUE, CONTRACT ASSETS, CONTRACT LIABILITIES AND CAPITALIZED CONTRACT COSTS",492.1,,492.1.1,,"Net revenues include all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Group. Ordinary activities refer to the core business and to other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services. Revenues are recorded net of value-added tax and other taxes collected from customers. Value-added tax and other taxes collected are remitted to governmental authorities. Net revenues are recognized in accordance with the provision of goods or services, provided that collectability of the consideration is probable. For service contracts with a continuous service provision, the contractually agreed total consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term, regardless of the payment pattern. A contract asset must be recognized if the Group recorded revenue for fulfilment of a contractual performance obligation before the due date of the consideration from the customer. F-129 ----- A contract liability must be recognized when the customer paid consideration or a receivable from the customer is due before the Group fulfilled a contractual performance obligation and thus recognized revenue. In a customer contract, contract liabilities must be set off against contract assets. Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services (e.g. mobile service contract plus handset) must be separated into distinct performance obligations, based on the stand-alone selling price that is recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the customer. In the Group, this especially concerns the sale of a mobile handset or other telecommunications equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed-network telecommunications service contract. The total transaction price of the bundled contract is allocated among the individual performance obligations based on their relative—possibly estimated—standalone selling prices, i.e., based on a ratio of the standalone selling price of each separate element to the aggregated standalone selling prices of the contractual performance obligations. The Group does not sell own produced products (e.g. handsets). As a result, the revenue to be recognized for products (often delivered in advance) such as mobile handsets that are sold in combination with a long-term service contract may be either higher or lower than the amount billed or collected, depending on the ratio for these products relative to the aggregated standalone selling prices. This leads to the recognition of what is known as a contract asset or a contract liability in the statement of financial position, depending on whether the revenue recognized is higher (contract asset) or lower (contract liability) compared to the amount billed or collected. The contract asset is a receivable arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence. This leads to higher revenue, in contrast to the amounts billed from the sale of goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the provision of services. The contract liability is an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration, or for which an amount of consideration is due from the customer. The contract liability is reversed and reduced over the remaining contract period, increasing revenue from the other performance obligations (in this: mobile service revenues) and results in lower revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise compared with the amounts billed. As distinct from promotional offers, options to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or at a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is deferred as a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires, providing the discount on future purchases is an implicit component of the consideration for the current contract and is also significant. The measure of significance is whether the decision by the (average) customer to enter into the current contract is likely to have been significantly influenced by their right to the future discount. Offers for volume discounts for the purchase of additional core products of an entity (e.g., a discount offered on an additional fixed-network contract for mobile customers) are classed by the Group as promotional offers to be excluded from consideration. Long-term customer receivables (e.g., arising from sales of handsets in instalments), contract assets (in connection with the conclusion of a long-term customer contract) or contract liabilities (e.g., arising from a prepayment by the customer) are recognized at present value if the financing component is significant in relation to the total contract value (i.e., including those performance obligations that do not contain a financing component). The discount rate also reflects the customer credit risk. The Group makes use of the option not to recognize a significant financing component if the period between when a good or service is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Payments to customers including credits or subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue unless the payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service from the customer, for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated. Gross versus net presentation: In cases where a company is in an intermediary position between another supplier/vendor (e.g., manufacturer, wholesaler) and a retail customer, it must be assessed whether the company itself supplies the relevant product or provides the service requested by the customer as the principal or whether the company merely acts as the agent for the supplier. The F-130 ----- outcome determines whether the entity can recognize revenue on a gross basis (as the principal) or on a net basis after deducting the costs to the supplier (as the agent). For the Group, the question arises particularly in the case of digital services (e.g., streaming services) purchased from third parties and sold to retail customers as part of the Group’s product portfolio. In summary, in case of rights to another party’s goods or services, the Group considers itself to be the principal vis-à-vis the retail customer if all of the following conditions are met and thus reports gross revenues: - The Group either has a contractual enforceable right to receive the predefined services “on demand” at predefined (fixed or variable) prices, and accordingly the other party has entered into an enforceable ongoing commitment to provide them, or the Group has entered into a material minimum purchase commitment. - The Group sells access to the other party’s services in its own name and for its own account under a contract between the Group and the retail customer. - The Group has discretion in setting the price for the other party’s services sold for its own account. Contract costs comprise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commissions paid to employees in the direct sales channel and third-party retailers in the indirect sales channel) and the costs to fulfil a contract. These must be capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be compensated by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would have not been incurred had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfil a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be capitalized under any other standard. The Group makes not use of the option to immediately recognize contract costs whose amortization period would be less than one year as an expense; this is in line with the DT group accounting policy. The capitalized contract costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer retention period. The expenses are disclosed in the Group’s income statement, not under depreciation and amortization but—depending on the sales channel—as goods and services purchased or personnel costs. In the indirect sales channel, third-party retailers often arrange service contracts on behalf of and for the account of the Group (as the agent), whereas in connection with the sale of handsets the third-party retailer act in their own name and for their own account (as the principal). In such cases, the third-party retailer receives the gross consideration of the handset from the Group and the same is recognized as loan receivable from the end-customer by the Group. In the direct sales channel the sale of subsidized handsets in connection with the conclusion of service contracts (multiple-element arrangement) is still common with business customers, In the subsidy model, an asset must thus be carried at the date of revenue recognition which is generally settled over a 24-month service contract term through payments made by the business customer, whereby the contract asset is repaid through the portion of the monthly invoice that exceeds the allocated monthly service revenues. Depending on the business model, revenue recognition at the Group is as follows: The mobile and fixed-network business includes mobile services, narrow- and broadband access to the fixed network and the internet, television via internet, connection and roaming fees billed to other mobile operators (wholesale business), sales, other telecommunications equipment and accessories. Revenue generated from the use of voice and data communications as well as television via internet is recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. The services rendered relate to use by customers (e.g., call minutes), availability over time (e.g., monthly flat rates), or other agreed rate plans. Revenue and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are F-131 ----- recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled company obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement. The Group does not have warranties or related obligations. Trade-in rights for used handsets which are granted to customers upon contract conclusion under the condition of a new purchase transaction (including renewal of an existing service contract) do not constitute repurchase arrangements; however, if the repurchase prices exceed the fair value of the handsets these rights must be recognized as separate performance obligations for which part of the contractual revenue is deferred until they are exercised or expire. Particularly in the mobile communications business, the timing of payments for mobile handsets purchased in connection with the conclusion of a service contract differs from the timing of the delivery and hence from revenue recognition. Where a significant financing component exists, revenue is measured at the present value. In case of a sale of handsets in connection with the conclusion of service contracts in the consumer business, the payment-by-instalment model is offered to customers. In the payment-by-instalment model, a handset loan must thus be carried at the date of revenue recognition which is generally repaid over a 24-month service contract term through payments made by the customer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801
641_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,494,2.12.18 INCOME TAXES,494.1,,494.1.1,,"Income taxes has included current income taxes as well as deferred taxes. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized where they are probable. They are measured in accordance with the tax laws applicable or already announced as of the reporting date, provided said announcement has the effect of actual enactment. Where current and deferred tax is recognized, it must be reported as income or expense except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction which is recognized outside profit and loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, or in connection with a business combination. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, has an intention to settle net, and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities must be recognized in the amount that the Group expects to settle or recover from the tax authorities. They include liabilities/receivables for the current period as well as for prior periods. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position and the tax base, as well as for tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilize those temporary differences and losses. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. F-132 ----- By way of derogation from this principle, deferred taxes are not recognized for temporary differences if deferred taxes arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit/tax loss. Deferred taxes are not recognized either for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred taxes are generally recognized for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

The transaction took place on 20 March 2020. InterNLnet is part of the Business operating segment. The divestiture has limited impact on our business: InterNLnet has approximately EUR 1M revenue on a yearly basis, 8 thousand customers and 9.9 FTE. On the 17[th] of March the Dutch Appeal Board for Trade and Industry (CBB) unexpectedly decided to completely annul ACM’s WFA (market analysis Wholesale Fixed Assets) in full as according to the CBB ACM did not sufficiently proof that there is a problem on the retail market negatively impacting consumers and ACM in its greenfield approach did not appropriately take the voluntary wholesale offers of KPN into account. This means that as of 17[th] of March 2020 KPN is no longer regulated and required to grant access to its network against cost-oriented prices. Since 31 December 2019, the spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted many local economies around the globe. In many countries, businesses are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, including travel bans, F-161 ----- quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock markets have also experienced great volatility and a significant weakening. Governments and central banks have responded with monetary and fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions. The Company determined that the current situation is considered to be a non-adjusting subsequent event. Accordingly, the financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended 31 December 2019 have not been adjusted to reflect their impact. The duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains uncertain at this time. Despite uncertainty over the impact of COVID-19 and consequences for our business, at this stage we expect the impact of the virus to be limited. While we did adjust our latest forecast downwards, our operating results and cash flows from operations to date have not been negatively affected compared to 2019. As at the date of these financial statements, the company has a robust liquidity and revolving credit facility headroom of EUR 100 million at Deutsche Telekom Europe B.V., and anticipates having sufficient liquidity to fulfill and finance its ongoing operations for the foreseeable future. In our view, the current assessment reflects management’s best estimate of the situation. We will continue to follow the government policies and advice and in parallel will do our utmost to continue our operations in the best and safest way possible without jeopardizing the health of our people and our customers. With reference to section 2.8, whilst uncertain, we do not believe, however, that the impact of the COVID-19 virus would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,801

F-229 ----- ### The basis for our opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ### Independence We are independent of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. in accordance with the ‘Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties’ (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). ## Report on the other information included in the annual report In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of: - the management board report; - the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information: - is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; - contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. The board of management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the management board report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Page 2 of 4 F-230 ----- ## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit ### Responsibilities of the board of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements The board of management is responsible for: - the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for - such internal control as the board of management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board of management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the board of management should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the board of management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The board of management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. ### Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may not detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report. Rotterdam, 31 December 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. P. van der Maarel RA _The above auditor’s report is the original auditor’s report that was issued on 31 December 2019 with respect to the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018. These financial statements also contained the company financial statements. For purposes of the Offering Memorandum the company financial statements have been omitted. Furthermore, the above auditor’s report refers to other information included in the annual report, being the management board report and the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, which is not included in the Offering Memorandum._ Page 3 of 4 F-231 ----- ## Appendix to our auditor’s report on the financial statements 2018 of T-Mobile Netherlands Holding B.V. In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report, we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves. ### The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following: - Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control. - Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. - Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of management. - Concluding on the appropriateness of the board of management’s use of the goingconcern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary. We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
