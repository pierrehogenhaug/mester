of the United States or the District of Columbia, and


-----

(3) if you are resident in a member state of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom,
you are not a retail investor (as defined below).

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs and QPs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities will be
relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A.

You are reminded that the preliminary offering memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that
you are a person into whose possession the preliminary offering memorandum may be lawfully delivered in
accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to,
deliver the preliminary offering memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer
or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers
are or is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial
Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the
preliminary offering memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there
be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The preliminary offering memorandum has not been approved for the purposes of Section 21 of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) and does not constitute an offer to the public in accordance
with the provisions of Section 85 of the FSMA. The preliminary offering memorandum is not being distributed
by, nor has it been approved by, an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is for distribution only to, and
is directed solely at, persons who (i) are investment professionals, as such term is defined in Article 19(5) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial
**Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies,**
unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv)
are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section
21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated
or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons”). The
preliminary offering memorandum is directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by
persons who are not Relevant Persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the preliminary offering
memorandum relates is available only to Relevant Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.
Any person who is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on this preliminary offering memorandum or any
of its contents.

The preliminary offering memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that
documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission
and consequently neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, nor any of their
directors, officers, employees or agents, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any
difference between the preliminary offering memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and the hard copy
version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

**Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of**
each manufacturer’s (the “Manufacturers”) product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of
the securities described in the preliminary offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target
market for such securities is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs
and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however,
a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such
securities (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom retail investors: The**
securities described in the attached preliminary offering memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i)
a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined


-----

in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom
has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The attached preliminary offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the
securities in any member state of the EEA or the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under
the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. The attached
preliminary offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Fixed Rate Euro Notes by paying the relevant applicable premium. Prior

equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Offering Memorandum, provided that at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the
Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a
change of control will be deemed not to have occurred if a specific consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In
addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. See “Description of
_the Notes” for more information._

On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by the Parent and certain other material
subsidiaries of the Issuer (collectively, the “Guarantors”), and the Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral (as defined herein).

“Authority”) to list the Notes on the Official List (the “Official List”) of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and to admit the Notes
for trading on the Exchange. There is no assurance that the application will be accepted or that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed on the Exchange.
The Exchange is not a regulated market for purposes of MiFID II.

You should consult with your own advisors as needed to assist you in making your investment decision and to

set out in this Offering Memorandum or in our business since the date of this Offering Memorandum.

This Offering Memorandum is a confidential document that we are providing only to prospective
purchasers of the Notes. The Issuer has prepared this Offering Memorandum solely for use in connection with the

you will hold the information contained in this Offering Memorandum and the transactions contemplated hereby
in confidence. You must not use this Offering Memorandum for any other purpose, make copies of any part of
this Offering Memorandum or give a copy of it to any other person; or disclose any information in this Offering
Memorandum or distribute this Offering Memorandum to any other person, other than persons retained to advise
you in connection with the purchase of the Notes.

By accepting delivery of this Offering Memorandum, you agree to the foregoing restrictions and agree
not to use any information herein for any purpose other than considering an investment in the Notes. This Offering
Memorandum may only be used for the purpose for which it was published. The information contained under
“Exchange Rate Information” includes extracts from information and data publicly released by official and other
sources. While we accept responsibility for accurately summarizing the information concerning exchange rate
information, we accept no further responsibility in respect of such information. The information set out in relation
to sections of this Offering Memorandum describing clearing and settlement arrangements, including the section
entitled “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,” is subject to any change in or reinterpretation of the rules, regulations
and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream.

We will not, nor will any of our agents or the Initial Purchasers, or any of our or their affiliates, have
responsibility for the performance of the respective obligations of Euroclear and Clearstream or their respective
participants under the rules and procedures governing their operations, nor will we or our agents have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, book-entry
interests held through the facilities of any clearing system or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records

continued applicability of their rules, regulations and procedures.

Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission nor
any non-U.S. securities authority has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined that this Offering
Memorandum is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The Issuer will
apply to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, and will submit this Offering Memorandum to the
competent authorities in connection with the listing application. Comments by the competent authority may
require significant modification or reformulation of information contained in this Offering Memorandum or may
require the inclusion of additional information. The Issuer may also be required to update the information in this
Offering Memorandum to reflect changes in our business, financial condition or results of operations and
prospects. We cannot guarantee that the application for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange
will be approved as of the settlement date for the Notes or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is
not conditioned on obtaining this listing.

The Issuer is offering the Notes and the Guarantors are issuing the Note Guarantees, in reliance on an
exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act for an offer and sale of securities that do not involve a
public offering. The Issuer and the Guarantors have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Investment
Company Act, in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(7) thereof. The Notes are subject to
restrictions on transferability and resale, which are described under “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer
_Restrictions.” By possessing this Offering Memorandum or purchasing any Note, you will be deemed to have_
represented and agreed to all of the provisions contained in that section of this Offering Memorandum. You should
be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time.

**Tax Considerations**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the consequences
of purchasing, holding and disposing of the Notes, including, without limitation, the application of U.S. federal
tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any consequences to them under the laws of any other taxing
jurisdiction, and the consequences of purchasing the Notes at a price other than the initial issue price. See

“STABILIZATION MANAGER”) (OR PERSON(S) ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZATION
MANAGER), MAY OVER-ALLOT THE RELEVANT NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A
VIEW TO SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE OF SUCH NOTES AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT
WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE
STABILIZATION MANAGER (OR PERSON(S) ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZATION
MANAGER) WILL UNDERTAKE ANY SUCH STABILIZATION ACTION. SUCH STABILIZATION
ACTION, IF COMMENCED, MAY BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE DATE OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE OF THE FINAL TERMS OF THE OFFER OF THE NOTES AND MAY BE ENDED AT ANY
TIME, BUT IT MUST END NO LATER THAN THE EARLIER OF 30 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE
ISSUE DATE AND 60 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF ALLOTMENT OF THE RELEVANT
NOTES. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION OR OVER ALLOTMENT MUST BE CONDUCTED BY THE
STABILIZATION MANAGER (OR PERSON(S) ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZATION
MANAGER) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND RULES.

**NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE U.S. INVESTORS**

The Notes will be sold outside the United States to investors who are both non-U.S. persons pursuant to
Regulation S and non-U.S. residents (as defined for purposes of the U.S. Investment Company Act) and within
the United States to persons who are both QIBs and QPs. The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and
will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United
States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Issuer and the Guarantors have not been
and will not be registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act, in reliance on the exemption provided by
Section 3(c)(7). The Notes shall not be offered, sold or delivered (i) as part of an Initial Purchasers’ distribution
at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the Issue Date,
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except pursuant to Rule 144A and
each dealer to which Notes have been sold during the distribution compliance period will be sent a confirmation
or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for
the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**CERTAIN VOLCKER RULE CONSIDERATIONS**

The Issuer and the Guarantors rely on an analysis that they do not come within the definition of
“investment company” under the U.S. Investment Company Act because of the exemption provided under Section
3(c)(7) thereunder. Consequently, each of the Issuer and the Guarantors will likely be a “covered fund” for
purposes of Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (together with the rules,
regulations and published guidance thereunder, as amended (the “Volcker Rule”)). See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes—The Volcker Rule may negatively affect the liquidity and the value of the Notes” and_
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN AND UNITED KINGDOM INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area and the United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member
state of the European Union (each such state an “EU Member State”) or the United Kingdom will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation (as defined below) from a requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the
Prospectus Regulation. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are
offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC, and
includes any relevant delegated regulations and regulatory technical standards enacted pursuant thereto.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the European Economic Area
(“EEA”) or the United Kingdom of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises
for the Issuer, the Guarantors or any Initial Purchaser to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer
nor the Guarantors nor any Initial Purchaser has authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the


-----

Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the
final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive (EU) 2014/65 (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU
(as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the
Prospectus Regulation (a “Qualified Investor”). Consequently no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the
United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each
manufacturer’s (the “Manufacturers”) product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes
is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of such Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum has not been approved for the purposes of Section 21 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and does not constitute an offer to the public in accordance with
the provisions of Section 85 of the FSMA. This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is only
directed at, persons who (i) are Investment professionals as such term is defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended, (the “Financial Promotion
**Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated**
associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to
whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the
FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to
be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons”). This Offering
Memorandum is directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not
Relevant Persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this document relates is available only to
Relevant Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons. Any person who is not a Relevant Person
should not act or rely on the Offering Memorandum or any of its contents.

in Belgium to qualified investors only, within the meaning of Article 3, §2, a) and 10 of the Belgian law of June

Law. Accordingly, this Offering Memorandum has not been and will not be notified to, or approved by, the

-----

applicable Canadian securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies
for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment hereto) contains a

refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars
of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities

The risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive. Other
sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to
predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
“Industry and Market Data,” and “Our Group’s Business” for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could
affect our future performance and the markets in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this Offering Memorandum may not be accurate or occur
at all. Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. In addition, from time to time we and our
representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking
statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, press
releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and other communications. Although we
believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no
assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statement or risk
factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All subsequent written
and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer is a holding company formed for the purpose of facilitating the financing of the GFKL
Acquisition along with other future potential transactions. After giving effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer’s only
material assets and liabilities are expected to include its interests in the issued and outstanding shares of Lowell
Holding GmbH and Simon Holdco Limited, its outstanding indebtedness under the Notes, the Existing €530
million 2023 Euro Notes, the Existing €415 million 2023 Euro Notes, the Existing 2023 SEK Notes, the Revolving
Credit Facility, the Subordinated Shareholder Funding to be provided as part of the Equity Contribution,
intercompany receivables under certain intercompany loans related to the 2018 Acquisitions, the Lowell
Acquisition and the GFKL Acquisition and intercompany balances incurred in connection with the transactions
described in the Offering Memorandum.

**_The Group_**

The historical financial information included in this Offering Memorandum for the Group is that of the
Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries.

This Offering Memorandum includes and presents:

    - the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Parent as of and for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2020, including the notes thereto (the “Unaudited Group
**Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”), which were prepared in accordance**
with IFRS on interim financial reporting (IAS 34);

    - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of and for the year ended December
31, 2019, including the notes thereto (the “2019 Group Consolidated Financial Statements”),
which were prepared in accordance with IFRS and have been audited by KPMG Luxembourg; and

    - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of and for the year ended December
31, 2018, including the notes thereto and the prior year comparative figures as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2017 (which were retrospectively adjusted to reclassify net portfolio write up
under income for consistency with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2018
following the adoption of IFRS 9) (the “2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements” and,
together with the 2019 Group Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Audited Group
**Consolidated Financial Statements” and the Audited Group Consolidated Financial Statements,**
together with the Unaudited Group Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the
“Group Consolidated Financial Statements”) which were prepared in accordance with IFRS and
have been audited by KPMG Luxembourg.

Solely for the convenience of readers, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2017 have been included in the F-pages of this Offering Memorandum,
though the discussion within the Offering Memorandum with respect to such year is drawn from the prior year
comparative figures from the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, this Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited consolidated profit and loss
information, as well as certain other financial and operating information, for the twelve months ended June 30,
2020. This information was derived by adding the condensed consolidated interim financial information of the
Parent for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to the consolidated financial information of the Parent for the year
ended December 31, 2019 and then subtracting the consolidated interim financial information of the Parent for
the six months ended June 30, 2019. This twelve-month data has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and
solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial
reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. The financial information for the six
months or twelve months ended June 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
any future periods, including the year ending December 31, 2020, and should not be used as the basis for or
prediction of an annualized calculation.

In this Offering Memorandum, we also present certain qualitative information prepared by management
relating to the 2018 Acquisitions. On March 20, 2018, we completed the 2018 Acquisitions to acquire a 100%


-----

share in Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS and their subsidiaries. The results of the acquisitions are included in the Group
Consolidated Financial Statements from April 1, 2018. The consolidated financial and operating information
reported by the Group following the 2018 Acquisitions is not comparable with the consolidated financial and
operating information reported prior to the 2018 Acquisitions.

Certain prior year comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 were adjusted
retrospectively with effect to January 1, 2017 in the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result
of the adoption of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2018, an adjustment was made to the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017 to reclassify net portfolio write-up under income
for consistency with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2018. For additional information see Note
1, “Significant Accounting Policies—Reclassification of prior year presentation,” to the 2018 Group Consolidated
Financial Statements.

**Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information**

Although this Offering Memorandum includes historical financial statements for the Group, it does not
include pro forma financial statements reflecting the estimated pro forma impact of the 2018 Acquisitions on our
historical results for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2018 or
2017, respectively.

Solely for the convenience of readers, in order to provide a meaningful income statement period-overperiod discussion in this Offering Memorandum, management has prepared certain unaudited _pro forma_
consolidated financial information of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Unaudited **_Pro_**
**_forma Consolidated Financial Information”), consisting of (i) the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial_**
Statements, which reflect the operations of Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS and their subsidiaries from April 1, 2018,
and (ii) the unaudited consolidated results of Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS and their subsidiaries (the “Nordics
**Carve-out”) for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Unaudited** _Pro forma Consolidated Financial_
Information reflects the following adjustments: (i) the assets and liabilities of the Nordics Carve-out were
recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), requiring purchase price adjustments
to certain assets, primarily existing customer relationships and owned debt portfolios; (ii) the ERC curves of the
Nordic Carve-out’s owned debt portfolios were adjusted from 180-months to 120-months; (iii) finance costs were
adjusted as if the 2018 Acquisitions, including the issuance of the Existing Hansa Notes and other related financing
transactions, had occurred on January 1, 2018 and (iv) income tax (expense) / credit was adjusted in accordance
with the above.

The unaudited consolidated financial information of the Nordics Carve-out for the three months ended
March 31, 2018 were calculated by adding the unaudited consolidated financial information of Lowell Sverige
and its subsidiaries for the period to the consolidated financial information of Lowell AS and its subsidiaries for
the period. For the three-months ended March 31, 2018, the unaudited consolidated results of Lowell Sverige and
its subsidiaries and the unaudited consolidated results of Lowell AS and its subsidiaries were prepared in
accordance with IFRS and Norwegian GAAP, respectively. As such, Lowell Sverige’s and Lowell AS’s respective
accounting policies and treatments and financial definitions may differ from each other and those of the Group
for such period.

Management has not prepared the Unaudited _Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information in_
accordance with the regulations of the SEC; the Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information is for
informational purposes only and does not necessarily present what our results would have been had the 2018
Acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2018, nor should it be used as the basis of projections of our results of
operations or financial condition for any future period. The Unaudited _Pro forma Consolidated Financial_
Information has not been audited or reviewed, does not indicate future results, has not been prepared in accordance
with any generally accepted accounting standards and should not be considered as an alternative to performance
measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. You should not
place undue reliance on the Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information, and no opinion or any other
form of assurance is provided with respect thereto.

The Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the
historical consolidated financial statements of the Group and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See also “Risk Factors—The Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated_
_Financial Information included in this Offering Memorandum may not represent what the actual consolidated_
_results of operations of the Group would have been if the 2018 Acquisitions had occurred at January 1, 2018.”_

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios for the Group, including Group
Adjusted Cash EBITDA and cash flow conversion, that are not required by, or presented in accordance with,
IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are defined by us as set out below.

We define “3PC income” or “income from 3PC services” as income derived from the provision of
third-party collection services. Lawyer service revenue is not included in 3PC income.

We define “Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA” as Gross Debt Purchase Collections plus other turnover,
less collection activity costs and other expenses (which, together, equals servicing costs) and before exceptional
items, depreciation, amortization and impairment of non-performing loans.

We define “Cash flow conversion” as cash flow generated by operations before portfolio acquisition
costs as a percentage of Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA for the period.

We define “Cash flow generated by operations before portfolio acquisition costs” as Group Adjusted
Cash EBITDA less working capital movement but excluding portfolio acquisition costs in the period.

We define “Group cash income” as Gross Debt Purchase Collections plus income from 3PC services.
Group cash income represents our cash collections from owned debt portfolios plus cash commissions received
from 3PC portfolios serviced. Lawyer service revenue is not included in Group cash income, as this revenue is
generated on a largely pass-through basis, with costs incurred in connection with lawyer service revenue generally
slightly exceeding such revenue.

We define “Group **_Pro forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA”_** as Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA plus
adjustments related to the run-rate effects of completed M&A and run-rate cost savings from restructuring and
redundancies.

We define “Gross Debt Purchase Collections” as actual amounts collected from owned debt portfolios
including put backs and, in the case of our DACH Division, after tax payments for VAT and insurance. Gross
Debt Purchase Collections also include consideration received for the sale of our own debt portfolios from time
to time, which represents an immaterial share of our Group cash income.

We define “net adjusted debt” as third-party debt (excluding accrued interest and subordinated
shareholder instruments included under “non-current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet) less cash and
cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash).

We define “other turnover” as service revenue, other revenue and other income not classified as
exceptional or non-recurring.

We define “portfolio acquisition costs” as cash outflow within the period to acquire debt portfolios.

We define “portfolio purchases” as the sum of purchase prices of debt portfolios acquired during the
period.

We define the “purchase price” of a debt portfolio as the value at which it is initially recorded on our
or our predecessor’s consolidated balance sheet, as applicable, at the time of purchase.

When we acquire a debt portfolio, there may be an interval between the time that the acquisition becomes
effective (when we recognize the portfolio on our balance sheet) and the time that payment is made (when we
recognize an outflow on our cash flow statement). If the end of a reporting period falls within that interval, the
acquisition will contribute to portfolio purchases for one period and portfolio acquisition costs for another period.
As a result, our portfolio purchases and portfolio acquisition costs for a given reporting period may slightly differ.

We define “working capital adjustments” as the movement in trade and other receivables, movement
in trade and other payables, movement in other net assets, unrealized gains / losses from foreign exchange for the
period, loss on disposal of subsidiary and loss on disposal of plant, property and equipment and intangible assets
in the period.

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they are widely used by certain investors,
securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The nonIFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be
considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS.
Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not
be considered as alternatives to consolidated profit/(loss) for the year or any other performance measures derived
in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow
from operating, investing or financing activities. The non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools.
Some of these limitations are:

    - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

    - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments, on our debts;

    - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and certain of these non-IFRS measures do
not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and

    - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA
reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made.

Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA as used in this Offering Memorandum is not calculated in the same
manner as “Consolidated EBITDA” is calculated pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes, as described
under “Description of the Notes” or for purposes of any of our other indebtedness.

**Non-Financial Operating Data**

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of our financial statements or financial
accounting records, and have not been audited by outside auditors, consultants or experts. Our use or computation
of these terms may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other
companies. Any or all of these terms should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of
performance under IFRS.

Our UK Division’s accounting records and non-financial operating data are denominated in pounds
sterling whereas our other divisions’ accounting records and non-financial operating data are denominated in euro,
Danish krone, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone. Unless a relevant division’s data had already been reported
by the Group in pounds sterling as part of its regular reporting, these data were translated from euro, Danish krone,
Swedish krona or Norwegian krone to pounds sterling to facilitate calculation of the pound sterling-denominated
combined non-financial operating data that appear in this Offering Memorandum. For other divisions’ data that
had already been reported by the Group in pounds sterling, the conversion rates used at the time of translation
were the applicable monthly reference rate based on the respective central bank’s foreign exchange reference
rates.

The key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum are defined as follows:

We define “accounts” as the individual non-performing loans and receivables that form a debt portfolio.
We consider an account under our owned debt portfolios to be “active” if we expect it to generate further
collections. We consider an account to be “inactive” if we do not expect it to generate further collections, such as
if the account is settled or closed, or we otherwise determine that we will not be able to collect upon it. Although
our owned debt portfolios include both active and inactive accounts, only active accounts as valued are portfolio
investments on our consolidated balance sheet.


-----

We define “debt portfolio” or “portfolio” as a portfolio of non-performing loans and receivables.

We define “Estimated Remaining Collections,” or “ERC,” as the expected future collections projected
to be received on all of our owned debt portfolios based on our forecasting models. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, our internal models forecast collections over a 120-month period for our UK Division and over a
180-month period for our DACH and Northern European Divisions.

In this Offering Memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, all references to ERC with respect to our UK
Division refer to ERC over a 120-month period and all references to ERC with respect to our DACH or Northern
European Divisions refer to ERC over a 180-month period. We report our UK Division’s ERC over a 120-month
period in line with our peers in the UK market, and our DACH and Northern European Divisions’ ERCs over a
180-month period in line with our peers in the European market. Our “120M ERC” is the ERC of our combined
Group over a 120-month period and our “Group ERC” is the sum of our UK Division’s 120-month ERC, our
DACH Division’s 180-month ERC and our Northern European Division’s 180-month ERC. For more information
about how we calculate ERC, including a reconciliation of ERC to the IFRS carrying amount of our owned debt
portfolios, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations— Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Estimated Remaining Collections (“ERC”).”_

We define the “face value” of an owned debt portfolio as the nominal value of receivables owed in
connection with such owned debt portfolio, including any accrued interest, fees and costs applied by the originator
at the time of purchase. The face value of an owned debt portfolio may be given as of the time of purchase or as
of a subsequent date. “Face value at time of purchase” is the face value of an owned debt portfolio at the time
we acquired it, and may include the face value of accounts that have since settled, closed or otherwise become
inactive. Face value as of a subsequent date is the face value of accounts that are active as of that date, and excludes
the face value of any inactive accounts.

We define a division’s “Gross Money Multiple” as the sum of the division’s Gross Debt Purchase
Collections since its Start Date and ERC from the division’s owned debt portfolios, divided by the division’s
portfolio purchases since its Start Date.

We define “owned debt portfolio” as a debt portfolio that we have acquired for settlement, including
those that are the subject of our securitization programs. All of our owned debt portfolios are unsecured.

We define “Start Date” as (i) June 1, 2004 with respect to our UK Division, (ii) September 30, 2003
with respect to our DACH Division and (iii) January 1, 2003 with respect to our Northern European Division and
the combined Group. A division’s Start Date corresponds to when it started acquiring debt portfolios for settlement
under the original management and ownership of such divisions or components thereof and, in each case, is earlier
than the date on which we acquired the relevant businesses.

We define “third-party debt under management” or “3PC debt under management” as the nominal
value of debt and receivables that we manage on behalf of third-party clients under our 3PC business.

We define “vintage” as the collection of owned debt portfolios acquired in a particular calendar year.

**Overview**

The Group is one of the largest Credit Management Services (“CMS”) providers in Europe, by revenue
and ERC in the debt purchasing business and by third-party debt under management in the third-party collection
services business. We believe that the business benefits from scale and diversification in terms of broad geographic
reach and balanced revenue mix, together with a complementary and client-focused product offering.
Furthermore, our expertise, management and financial resources provide the Group with excellent opportunities
to drive further growth and diversification in a highly developed, data-rich credit market. These growth prospects
are supported by our clear core competencies: (i) longstanding and multifaceted client relationships built on
differentiated strategies for originating new business; (ii) a broad business model that is diversified across product
offerings, markets and sectors; (iii) a strong track record of return on capital and reliable portfolio pricing; (iv)
strong cash-generation capability featuring high predictability and visibility into future cash flows; and (v) a robust
and improving governance framework with a focus on reputation and compliance that we believe is embedded in
our operational activity.

We provide a range of credit management services across the UK, DACH (collectively, Germany,
Austria and Switzerland) and Northern Europe (collectively, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) to a broad
client base that includes some of the largest credit providers in Europe. The principal activity of the Group is: the
acquisition and collection of non-performing, generally unsecured, consumer debt portfolios (“DP”); and the
provision of third party contingent collection (“3PC”) services. 3PC services include debt servicing offerings such
as early stage collections, business process outsourcing, contingent collections, trace services and litigation
activities. We operate 3PC services primarily in Germany, Austria and Northern Europe. The Group is very well
regarded within the industry, a reputation that is further supported by the Group’s key strategic themes of strong
customer focus and risk management. Best practices relating to our sophisticated pricing, decision science and
cost-optimization experience are continuously shared across our business and make the Group a trusted partner to
credit originators and consumers alike.

Our Group generated total income of £746.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £657.1
million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated
operating profit of £150.5 million, Group cash income of £949.6 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of
£496.0 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated operating profit of £112.0 million,
Group cash income of £930.3 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of £512.7 million (£280.9 million in
our UK Division, £101.4 million in our DACH Division and £133.2 million in our Northern European Division,
net of £2.7 million of Group costs). As of June 30, 2020, our Gross Money Multiple was 2.6x in the UK Division,
3.2x in the DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division and we had £13.2 billion (as of December
31, 2019: £12.4 billion) of third-party debt under management.

We believe that we are a more diversified business than ever before, with a scaled pan-European presence
and a range of services on offer that compares favorably to peers. Our ability to provide a full range of services
across the CMS value chain helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectable data,
which in turn supports the development of tailored collection strategies and analytical capabilities to more
accurately price portfolios. Operating with a balanced business model across Europe also enables us to allocate


-----

resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the opportunities that are most attractive. Furthermore, the
acquisition of the Northern European Division in 2018 has enabled the Group to provide clients with an enhanced
range of value-added services before loans and receivables are overdue. These include invoicing, in which the
client can outsource its CMS to the Northern European Division, and ability to offer consumers payment through
invoice or part payment solutions and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management
capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information.
These solutions have enabled us to access a wider breadth of credit active customers earlier in the value chain,
before the delinquency phase.

As the Group continues to develop, we expect to further capitalize on the Group’s strengths by: (i)
delivering a multi-product, multi-service and pan-regional offering while maintaining clear pricing discipline; (ii)
establishing an industry benchmark for operational excellence through investments in its one-stop service
offering; (iii) maintaining a reputation for pioneering insights by continuously improving its IT, data and
collection platforms through innovations and investment; (iv) continuing to take a best practices approach to its
client relationships and (v) continuing to invest in its employees and corporate culture.

**Our History**

Since the completion of the Lowell Acquisition in October 2015, our Group, which is controlled by
Permira, historically operated through two entities: (i) Metis Bidco Limited and its consolidated direct and indirect
subsidiaries, which operated in the UK and (ii) Lowell Holdco GmbH and its consolidated direct and indirect
subsidiaries, which operated primarily in Germany. As of April 2017, we rebranded the Group as “Lowell” and,
following the 2018 Acquisitions, primarily operate at a Group level, with three divisions: our “UK Division,” our
“DACH Division” and our “Northern European Division.”

As of June 30, 2020, the Group had 3,966 FTEs, with 1,669 in the UK Division, 1,427 in the DACH
Division and 870 in the Northern European Division.

Our UK Division was established in 2004 and is a leading provider of CMS in the UK, the sole
jurisdiction in which it operates. While our UK Division focuses mainly on debt purchase, it performs limited
third-party collection services in several sectors and offers certain other CMS activities. Metis Bidco Limited and
its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries are now contained within our UK Division following our
rebranding in April 2017.

Our DACH Division was founded in 1992 and is a leading provider of CMS in Germany. Our DACH
Division primarily operates in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Our DACH Division is active across the full
value chain of CMS. Lowell Holdco GmbH and its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries are now contained
within the DACH Division following our rebranding in April 2017.

The Northern European Division is an established player across the Northern European markets with a
long track record in each country: Finland (1966), Sweden (1981), Norway (1982) and Denmark (1994). The
Northern European Division is active across the full value chain of CMS with strong capabilities across all client
sectors. The Northern European Division was formed by the combination of Lindorff’s legacy businesses in
Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden, as well as Intrum’s legacy business in Norway.

**Our Key Strengths**

**_Leading position across key European consumer credit markets_**

The Group is the second largest pan-European credit management company by revenue, Group Adjusted
Cash EBITDA and ERC, for the twelve months ended and as of June 30, 2020. Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA
for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was £496.0 million and £512.7
million, respectively. We believe the scale of the Group provides several strategic benefits, including bolstering
our ability to competitively price portfolios in our debt purchasing activities and develop optimal collection
strategies, which we believe will have a positive impact on our revenue and efficiency. Additionally, we believe
that the large scale of our business allows us to absorb fixed costs better than our smaller peers, including those
related to regulatory and legal, compliance and IT, which should further benefit our margins. Our Group Adjusted
Cash EBITDA margin, defined as Group cash income divided by Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA, was 55.1% for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, an improvement from the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.


-----

We believe the Group’s expanded geographic footprint across our eight core markets, with top-three
positions in seven of those markets, combined with top-tier local market positions is a competitive advantage
which will further enhance our ability to follow our clients across markets and deepen client relationships.

The UK Division, DACH Division and the Northern European Division, our current market-leading and
complementary operational divisions, operate primarily in the largest consumer credit markets in Europe, the UK,
Germany and Northern Europe. As of December 2019, the UK had approximately £224 billion (according to the
Bank of England), Germany had approximately £171 billion and Northern Europe had approximately £158 billion
(according to European Central Bank, Swedish Central Bank, Danish Central Bank and Norges Bank) of consumer
credit outstanding. In the year ended December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we invested
£397.3 million and £351.1 million, respectively, to acquire debt portfolios. As of June 30, 2020, we had £13.2
billion of third-party debt under management (a 1.6% increase compared to June 30, 2019), with LTM placements
of over £2.2 billion.

In addition, we believe that by focusing on a broad range of sectors, we are able to address a greater
portion of all consumer credit volumes generated annually in the UK, DACH and Northern Europe, than we would
otherwise be able to address with a less comprehensive approach. We are a market leader and a pioneer in servicing
debt originators across multiple sectors. We also have a strong track record of successfully entering new market
sectors and gaining high market shares in those sectors, such as the telecommunications, retail and public sectors
in the UK, the insurance and fitness sectors in Germany and the financial services sector in Northern Europe.

In the UK, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we believe we had a market-leading share of lowbalance debt portfolio purchases in the telecommunications sector and were among the market leaders in the retail
sector of the UK debt purchase market. In Germany, we believe we are in the top four CMS by revenue. Across
Northern Europe, the Northern European Division purchases debt portfolios across a wide array of industry
verticals and holds the number two market position, as defined by debt collection revenue, in Sweden and Finland.
It is also ranked amongst the top three in Denmark and amongst the top five in Norway.

We believe our scale provides key benefits critical to our success. For example, we are able to develop
and maintain a superior operating platform, with highly skilled talent, customized IT systems and sophisticated
analytical and data capabilities that drive pricing and debt-collection efficiencies. We believe our scale also
enables us to absorb costs associated with legal obligations and regulatory oversight and allows us to provide our
clients with a comprehensive service offering capable of addressing their needs throughout the debt recovery
cycle. Due to our ability to provide a one-stop service offering, we believe we are able to better maintain and
develop relationships with large debt originators than our smaller peers in the UK, DACH and Northern European
markets, and as a result, are better positioned than our smaller peers for rapid growth in these respective markets.
Furthermore, we believe that the acquisition of the Northern European Division has helped our competitive
advantages and fortified our position as a preeminent player in the European CMS sector.

The Company has a proven track record of maintaining long-term relationships with clients which
include some of the largest credit originators in Europe. We have also historically achieved high levels of repeat
purchases from existing customers, which we believe showcases the strong credentials and reputation of our
business. Our CMS service line is a market leading platform in DACH and Northern Europe, with a proven track
record and longstanding client relationships. Our CMS service line maintains over 300 relationships with average
relationship length of approximately eight years.

**_Attractive Market Dynamics Supporting Growth and Profitability_**

We believe that the characteristics of the core markets in which we operate are conducive to sustainable
growth and profitability for the Group. The UK, Germany and Northern Europe have historically benefited from
stable macroeconomic conditions, including high levels of per capita GDP, low inflation, low interest rates and
low unemployment levels. Despite uncertainty around post-Brexit UK and the COVID-19 outbreak and their
respective economic and social ramifications, we believe that our core markets will continue to benefit from
supportive structural factors and an improving macroeconomic environment post-COVID-19. In addition, we
believe that the legal and regulatory environment in each jurisdiction is strong and stable, which, in our view,
fosters market stability. Similarly, we believe that the UK will continue to have a stable legal and regulatory
environment as it applies to our business. We also believe that the demanding nature of regulatory compliance in
UK, Germany and Northern Europe can be burdensome to small businesses and may therefore increase
consolidation opportunities for large players in the CMS.


-----

Moreover, the markets in which we operate comprise a diverse range of sectors in which consumer debt
is originated (e.g., the financial services, insurance, retail, telecommunications, public and utilities sectors, among
others). We believe we are able to develop business in this broad range of sectors, in part, because CMS companies
such as ours can provide certain benefits to debt originators across sectors, including consumer insights and cost
reductions due to reduced administrative and labor costs, improved collection rates and a more professional
approach to debt collection. Further, debt originators’ outsourcing of the debt collection process yields the
additional benefit for the debt originator of reducing management time devoted to what is typically a non-core
activity, while also providing additional consistency in debt handling with a more robustly documented audit trail.

With respect to size and growth of consumer credit markets in our geographies, we believe that the
market in the UK has several distinctive features that make it attractive to CMS companies like us. We believe
that the UK is the largest consumer credit market in Europe, with an estimated £224 billion of outstanding debt
as of December 2019, according to the Bank of England. In addition, we believe that the UK has one of the largest
NPL markets in Europe by face value of defaulted debt sold annually. We believe that the UK consumer NPL
market is consolidating around a small number of sophisticated and large-scale players, such as our UK business,
which we believe is competitively advantaged to grow more quickly, and at higher levels of profitability, than its
smaller peers. We believe such players have a number of structural advantages, including, for example, an ability
to exploit more extensive consumer databases, a heightened capacity to absorb the burdens of an increasingly
demanding compliance environment and an ability to more readily develop a comprehensive service offering for
their clients. Moreover, management has observed a growing propensity on the part of UK debt originators to sell
debt portfolios earlier in the recovery process, and we believe that their demand for other CMS services is likely
to increase, not just in response to COVID-19-related stress but throughout the credit cycle.

Similarly, the consumer credit market in Germany is also distinguished by several features that, in our
view, make it attractive to CMS companies. We believe that Germany is the second largest consumer credit market
in Europe, with an estimated £171 billion of outstanding debt as of December 2019, according to the European
Central Bank. In addition, Germany boasts a large stock of overall defaulted debt and is also one of the largest
consumer NPL markets in Europe by flow of newly created unsecured consumer defaulted debt. A diverse range
of German businesses, from sectors such as financial services, fitness, retail and telecommunications, originate
consumer credit from a diverse consumer base. These businesses use a varied set of collection methods to support
the debt recovery process and typically outsource the majority of their receivables collections. Moreover,
management has observed demand among German debt originators for BPO services and a willingness on the
part of German debt originators to outsource collection in the early stages of the recovery process (for example,
by as early as 45 days after the original payment due date). Since the German CMS market is highly fragmented,
with approximately 600 to 900 players, we believe that large players, such as the Group, have a competitive
advantage due to the scale and the breadth of their client relationships, which helps them originate new debt
purchases and 3PC agreements. In addition, we believe that Germany has both a strong repayment culture and
creditor-friendly laws and regulations, and that together, these features create a favorable environment for debt
collection. Creditors in Germany benefit from a long enforcement period against consumers, since the statutory
limitation period in Germany for applying for and obtaining an enforcement title against consumers is generally
three years and, once obtained, the enforcement title is valid for 30 years. Further, under German law, creditors
are generally entitled to charge additional amounts to the consumer as damage caused by delayed payment,
including default interest, the costs of third-party collection services and legal costs. Each of these factors has, in
our view, helped to drive up the profitability of debt collection in Germany.

The consumer credit market in Northern Europe is also a large and mature market with a stable regulatory
regime. The credit management industry in Northern European countries has existed for more than 100 years, and
matured significantly following the financial crisis in the 1990s, when debt collection companies, including the
Northern European Division, grew their businesses and supported clients in their deleveraging of large, overdue
debt portfolios. In 3PC services, clients have historically preferred well-known and established players. This has
benefited the Northern European Division with its leading pan-Northern European platform. According to a
market study by a leading consultancy firm in September 2017, the proportion of debt portfolio sales compared
to 3PC serviced portfolios is expected to increase from their current level of approximately 40% of the overall
NPL market, as clients, particularly financial institutions, show an increasing willingness to optimize their balance
sheet. The Northern European Division is, thus, also well placed to take advantage of this trend owing to
significant operational synergies among its business segments as its debt collection segment serves as an
origination source for debt purchasing.

Based on data from the European Banking Authority (“EBA”), European bank NPL stock amounted to
approximately £0.5 trillion as of December 31, 2019, representing more than 1.2 times 2007 levels. We believe
that European bank NPL stock could increase to as much as £1.2 trillion, based on a peak European NPL ratio of


-----

6.8% reached in Q4 2013 and outstanding loans and advances of £18.0 trillion as of December 31, 2019. We
expect continued regular and proactive sales by banks as they manage a broad range of new rules and regulations,
such as Basel IV, IFRS 9 and ECB calendar provisioning. As a result, we anticipate an increase in debt sales as a
proportion of NPL stock. Moreover, we believe that non-traditional, digital lenders that have experienced rapid
loan book growth in recent years do not have in-house collection expertise and are likely to engage CMS players
to service their portfolios.

**_A Balanced Business Model with Significant Diversification Benefits_**

The Group operates a balanced and diversified business model. Our debt purchase business and 3PC
services business generated 82% and 18% of Group cash income, respectively, for each of the year ended
December 31, 2019 and 83% and 17%, respectively, the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. During the twelve
months ended June 30, 2020, our Group earned revenue from over 4,000 portfolios for our debt purchasing
business and from over 300 different clients for our third-party collection services. In addition, we believe we
have the most diversified industry mix among our peers. Our client base encompasses clients in the financial
services, insurance, retail, telecommunications, fitness, public and utilities sectors, among others. As of June 30,
2020, our 120M ERC split by industry was financial services (58%), retail (22%), telecommunications (15%),
and other (5%). For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Group’s portfolio purchases split by industry was
financial services (61%), retail (17%), telecommunications (13%) and other (10%). The Group is able to provide
these clients with a one-stop service offering that includes third-party collection services, risk management and
value-added services. We believe this one-stop service offering helps us both to build strategic partnerships and
to embed ourselves further in our clients’ credit-management processes. For example, management has observed
that our provision of third-party debt collection services can lead to debt purchases and help improve our debt
portfolio modelling.

In addition to diversification, we believe our pan-European presence allows us to realize a number of
key benefits that we believe provides us with key competitive advantages. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2020, the UK Division, DACH Division and Northern European Division contributed 47.7%, 27.4% and 24.9%,
respectively, to Group cash income. We believe the combination of allocating capital at a group level into markets
where we believe our risk/reward return is the most attractive and the expertise of the individual businesses allows
us to allocate capital and originate business across markets, sectors and clients to wherever we see the greatest
opportunities. We believe that this increased flexibility enhances our adaptability and resilience in changing
market trends and economic cycles. Moreover, since we have a higher volume of accounts, spread across a more
diverse array of sectors and debt originators, we believe we are advantaged in our pricing accuracy and our ability
to enhance the efficiency of our collection processes.

Our broad-based business model has been enhanced by the acquisition of the Northern European
Division, which is active across the entire CMS value chain in Northern Europe. In addition to 3PC services and
debt purchasing, the Northern European Division provides a wide range of value-added services before debt and
receivables are overdue, including consumer and credit information and analysis, selection and scoring of potential
consumers, invoicing and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management
capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information.

The Northern European Division has reinforced our flexibility and balanced product offering, which we
believe positions us well to maximize revenue by offering solutions to clients along the entire CMS value chain,
enabling us to operate as a “one-stop shop” for our clients. While our predominant activities continue to remain
debt collection and debt purchasing, the value-added services segment has become an important source of
origination for the debt purchasing and debt collection businesses and for data collection.

**_A Consumer-Centric Approach at the Core of our Business_**

Our collection rate is dependent on our ability to both understand consumers and to treat them fairly and
with respect. We believe that by treating our consumers in this manner, and by ensuring regulatory compliance
and maintaining a strong risk management discipline within our Group, we are able to maintain and foster a
positive reputation. We believe that having a positive reputation is a key factor to our success as a debt servicing
company.

Our UK Division has received numerous accolades for its strong track record with respect to the quality
of its customer service. Our UK Division has received a number of awards from Investors in Customers (“IIC”),
a UK customer-experience consultancy, including a “Gold Award” in 2017 (previous “star” ratings have been
replaced with bronze, silver and gold awards and we were the first company to receive the Gold Award), a “Gold


-----

for Investors in Customers” in 2018, “Debt Purchase Provider of the Year” in 2019 and “Best Use of Technology”
for our roll out of Robotic Process Automation in 2019. Our UK Division also benefits from a Trustpilot (a
consumer review website) rating of 4.4/5 stars. Our DACH Division has also been recognized for its consumer
service. According to a 2018 report, we held the highest S&P Servicer Rating level for German CMS providers.
Our Northern European Division has also been recognized for its commitment to consumer service, and in 2019,
Lowell Norway won “The CX Mover: Best implementation – Time to achieve value” at the world’s largest
conference for contact centers and customer experiences in Denver, Colorado, USA.

These achievements are a product of our focus on risk management. Our risk management framework is
grounded in our management structure, our processes and a “three lines of defense” risk-management (see “Our
_Group’s Business—Compliance and Risk Management” for a description of the “three lines of defense” model)_
that we believe mirrors the highest risk-management standards in the CMS industry.

Compliance is at the heart of our Group’s operations. We believe that we have a strong track record with
respect to consumer complaints in all the geographies we operate in. For example, for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2020, the FOS-filed complaint ratio in our UK Division was 11.9 cases filed per one million active
financial services accounts. In our DACH Division, we received, on average, 0.01% consumer complaints as a
percentage of active accounts for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. In our Northern European Division, we
received, on average, 0.003% consumer complaints as a percentage of active accounts for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2020. A focus on risk management and compliance are woven into our Group’s structure from the
local level to the internal and independent external risk control and auditing functions carried out at the executive
and board levels.

We believe the decision science that underlies our Group’s collection techniques contributes to our ability
to manage compliance and reputational risk. We further believe that our focus on and extensive experience in
compliance and risk management resonate well with debt originators and provide us with a competitive advantage
in the UK, DACH and Northern European regulatory environments, which, though different in their particular
legal frameworks and regulations, are similarly designed, robust and stable. It is our view that the well-developed
nature of such environments provides us with a competitive advantage and favors strong market participants, such
as our Group, which has the scale and experience necessary to meet demanding compliance requirements.

Our Group has an overarching commitment to be a fair and principled business that puts people at the
heart of the culture, particularly our consumers. This shared values-based approach is central to our integration
and provide consistency to our vision of being the best in our field.

**_Competitive Advantage Embedded in Sophisticated Data Analytics_**

The Group has invested, and continues to invest, in what we believe to be industry-leading IT and data
platforms in our markets. Through our consumer data, which we believe to also be industry-leading, we have
developed proprietary behavioral and asset valuation models, custom software applications and a variety of other
business tools. The Group’s systems are technologically sophisticated, highly automated and driven by data
derived from databases of owned and serviced debt portfolios in the markets in which we operate, and we believe
that our Group has the largest databases in the UK and DACH and one of the largest datasets in Northern Europe.
State of the art data science techniques serve as an integral part in the process of pricing portfolios ahead of
acquisitions and allow the business to establish more efficient debt, consumer and customer engagement
strategies. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s systems held data derived from some 4,281 owned debt portfolios,
of which there were 22.2 million active accounts. We believe that our data systems benefit from a virtuous circle
that further strengthens our informational advantage relative to that of our competitors. In our experience, the
more debt portfolios we service or purchase, the more data and collection experience we derive and the more
accurate our tracing and pricing systems become. We also believe that our systems’ increasing sophistication has
the additional benefit of making them increasingly difficult to replicate.

Thus, given the breadth of our experience throughout the credit management value chain, we have access
to comprehensive databases of purchased and serviced debt. Our IT and data platforms are subject to an ongoing
process of improvement and innovation, which we support with ongoing investment. We believe that our
sophisticated and scalable IT and data platforms, in which we have made robust investments, provide significant
competitive advantages. Combined with our decision science capabilities, we are able to take a centralized
approach to forecasting and pricing that is supported by specialist local input, ensuring strong cross-organizational
evaluation of portfolio pricing. In our experience, our automated pricing models and tracing systems have helped
to increase the accuracy with which we price both owned debt portfolios and third-party collection service


-----

contracts, thereby increasing our chance to win a bid at the right price while reducing our downside risk on the
owned debt portfolio or signed contract.

The Group’s data capabilities combined with lean operational processes also facilitate more efficient and
effective debt collection strategies through robotics, data science and cross-learning. In addition, the risk
management approach of the Group helps to ensure that the sophisticated pricing information is used in an
investment decision-making context that focuses on compliance and maintaining strong internal controls. We
believe that our sophisticated collection strategies and approach to a digital enabled business, in turn, lead to
increased collection efficiency and reduced collection costs. Further, we believe our sophisticated IT and data
platforms allows us to compete effectively in sectors in which our peers struggle to generate sufficient returns, in
particular in low-balance sectors such as retail, telecommunications and utilities.

**_Strong Track Record of Return on Capital and Portfolio Pricing Through the Cycle_**

We believe that we have a track record of strong and stable return on capital supported by continuous
improvement in decision science and the use of feedback from our collection operations. The Group’s aggregate
Gross Money Multiple on portfolios purchased as of June 30, 2020 was 2.6x in our UK Division, 3.2x in our
DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division. Moreover, since Group management is involved in
investment decisions at each division, we believe that we are able to deploy our capital across the UK, DACH and
Northern European regions to wherever returns are most promising, which we believe contributes to our ability
to maintain high returns on capital. We believe that continuous improvement in decision science and leveraging
feedback from collection operations have helped strengthen our underwriting, resulting in a narrower disparity
between forecasted and actual returns. Our historical actual collections compared to forecast collections
demonstrate our accurate and disciplined yet prudent forecasting. We have steadily met or exceeded our forecasted
collections, even during more challenging economic environments. For example, following the 2008 to 2009
financial crisis, our UK predecessor company’s actual collections exceeded forecasts, with actual collections on
the December 31, 2008 static pool reaching 104% of forecasted collections by June 2020. Our Group’s actual
Gross Debt Purchase Collections on portfolios owned by the Group as of December 31 of the prior year (the
“static pool”) were 103% of our forecasted collections for the year ended December 31, 2018, 104% of our
forecasted collections for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 94% of our forecasted collections for the six
months ended June 30, 2020, and we have met or outperformed our forecasted collections on the static pool each
year between 2007 and 2019.

We believe that our disciplined approach to portfolio pricing has helped us avoid overbidding on debt
portfolios. Our portfolio pricing process begins with a rigorous and extensive due diligence and valuation exercise,
which may involve, among other things, building a synthetic debt portfolio with actual performance data and
similar consumer characteristics and performing on-site file testing to assess the underlying quality of the debt
portfolio before submitting our final bid. Our due diligence and valuation methods benefit from the market-leading
scale of our data, our sophisticated and automated data systems and our experienced and skilled portfolio pricing
specialists. Our ability to leverage our own data and our specific expertise and databases from comparable
portfolios across many sectors minimizes risk and helps to ensure accurate pricing bolstered by strong in-house
analytical capabilities. Upon the successful completion of due diligence, a debt portfolio is subject to a clear and
systematic internal review and approval process culminating in a decision to either approve or reject the proposed
portfolio investment. Our disciplined capital deployment and selectivity with respect to portfolio purchases has
helped us achieve an IRR with respect to our portfolio purchases of 19% for the twelve months ended June 30,
2020 compared to 16% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.

**_High Visibility into Future Cash Flow Generation_**

Our debt portfolio purchase business provides excellent visibility into future earnings, as well as
substantial cash-flow generation backed by a significant asset base. Although the Group’s ERC metrics extend
for up to 180 months, depending on the division, a majority of collections occur within the first 48 months. As of
June 30, 2020, we expected approximately 34% of our 120M ERC to be collected within the next 24 months and
approximately 58% to be collected within the 48-month period. As of June 30, 2020, the Group had 4,281 owned
debt portfolios and 120M ERC was £3,466.1 million, resulting in an aggregate Gross Money Multiple on
portfolios purchased of 2.6x for our UK Division, 3.2x for our DACH Division and 2.5x for the Northern European
Division. We believe we take a cautious approach to repayment by attempting to establish recurring payment
methods with lower rates of default, such as direct debits and continuous payment authorizations on debit and
credit cards.


-----

In addition, we believe that the multi-year nature of our forward flow agreements helps to provide us
with visibility into new business origination and expected returns. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 55%
of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases came from forward flow agreements. Similarly, forward flow
agreements accounted for 55% and 67% of portfolio purchases in the DACH Division and Northern European
Division respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020.

In addition, we made £351.1 million of portfolio purchases for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020
and believe that our significant asset base of owned debt portfolios is capable of continuing to yield predictable
cash flows. We believe that our ERC forecast is reliable and resilient, as a significant portion of the payments on
our portfolios are made through long-term payment plans. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 long term
payment plans as a percentage of collections was 80% in the UK Division, 40% in the DACH Division and 24%
in the Northern European Division.

Our third-party collection services business is also cash generative and typically enables us to scale our
business without requiring significant incremental investments. We believe that the contractual arrangements in
the third-party collection services business, which are both stable and of increasing durations (notably for contracts
with large, well-known clients), provide visibility into future collections, the fees we derive from them as well as
associated cash-flow generation. Our income from 3PC services was £169.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 and £158.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019
income from 3PC services represented 17.8% of Group cash income and for the twelve months ended June 30,
2020 income from 3PC services represented 17.1% of Group cash income.

Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA was £496.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £512.7
million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, and 120M ERC was £3,466.1 million as of June 30, 2020.
Our Group cash income, gross profit, and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA each increased between the twelve
months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020. For more information regarding Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA, 120M
ERC and other non-IFRS financial measures and non-financial operating data, see “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information.”_

**_Management Team Supported by Skilled and High-Quality Business Professionals_**

We are managed by a strong executive team, which comprises individuals with many years of relevant
experience and provides leadership across all functional areas of our business. In particular, we believe that our
business has one of the most experienced senior management teams among European CMS companies. For
example, our current CEO previously served as CFO from 2013 until his appointment to CEO in June 2019 and
has over 17 years’ experience in the financial services industry, and our CFO who joined in 2020 has 29 years of
senior executive experience including 13 years in FTSE 100 organizations. The Group has a wide bench of strong
management talent spread across our regions.

In addition, strong teams of qualified professionals, who are drawn from the wider financial services
industry and other large corporate entities involved in consumer outreach, support our senior management team
by performing central business functions and assisting in the execution of our strategy. These skilled managers
are supported by a workforce of approximately 3,966 FTEs as of June 30, 2020. We continuously invest in our
employees with sustained efforts to create an inclusive and staff-friendly work environment and to provide
meaningful career-development opportunities.

Our combined corporate governance structure is intended to provide strong oversight and to support
decision-making while retaining the entrepreneurial spirit and market specific knowledge required to extend our
strong track record of growth and profitability. Our executive team has established compliance frameworks,
operational procedures and governance structures, supported by a number of proprietary systems, to enable us to
conduct business in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and guidance.

**Our Strategy**

**_Consumer Focus and Relationships that Provide Long-Term Value Creation_**

We aim to continue our discipline of operating ethically, transparently and in compliance with all
applicable rules, regulations and guidance. We intend to focus on providing a fair, understanding and consumer
centric approach to our debt collection services. To that end, we intend to work with each consumer to develop a
payment plan that is realistic, sustainable through economic cycles and tailor-made to the consumer’s
circumstances, allowing the consumer to restore his or her financial standing and continue to access mainstream


-----

credit products. To maintain and enhance this individualized approach to our consumers, we intend to continue to
leverage our decision science capabilities in order to help ensure that the consumer profiles we build are as
accurate and up-to-date as possible. We aim to communicate closely, clearly and transparently with the consumer
and strive to understand their situation and circumstances. We believe that clear communication will enable us to
have visibility with regard to the timing and profile of future collections.

As the legal and regulatory environments in which we operate continue to evolve, we intend to adapt our
culture, practices and policies appropriately, while always seeking to be the model that others look to for
compliance standards and best practices. Compliance is an increasingly important differentiating factor in our
industry and in the markets in which we operate. We believe that our focus on compliance reassures our clients
that their customers and reputations are in safe hands, and thus will give us a key competitive advantage going
forward.

**_Establish an Industry Benchmark for Operational Excellence Through a Diversified One-Stop Offering_**

We believe that debt originators are increasingly seeking a holistic, cost-efficient approach to CMS that
fully complies with applicable regulations. To address this growing need, we aim to continue to develop our onestop service offering, a differentiated services offering that addresses each step of the debt recovery cycle and
thereby helps us to further embed our operations within those of our clients. We also intend to further diversify
our one-stop service offering by capitalizing on the Northern European Division’s value-added services offering.
Moreover, we have a strong track record of opening new sectors to the CMS market, such as entering into the
telecommunications and utilities market in the UK, and we seek to continue to build relationships with entities
that have not previously sold debt portfolios or purchased CMS services. Our geographic diversity has positioned
us to fully leverage our geographic footprint by launching products which have been successful in one market into
our other markets. Our longstanding client relationships and high volumes of data in our UK, DACH and Northern
European markets, along with our meaningful presence throughout our other markets, contribute to our ability to
anticipate our clients’ changing needs while identifying new market opportunities.

The Group’s strategy will be focused on increasing its current share of the CMS markets in the UK,
DACH and the Northern European regions by continuing to work closely with the main debt originators in each
of our key sectors. We have adopted a proactive approach to managing our relationships with debt originators,
with an emphasis on transparency and building longstanding professional relationships based on a granular
understanding of a debt originator’s business and CMS requirements. This local, specialized approach to our client
relationships allows us to provide specialized offerings that have been tailored to reflect the consumer’s individual
needs.

**_Maintain Our Reputation for Pioneering Insights by Continuously Improving our IT, Data Analytics, Data_**
**_Science and Collection Platforms through Innovations and Investment_**

We are continuously looking to improve our IT, data analytics, data science and collection platforms and
processes and harmonize our core applications in order to strengthen our services offering and operate more
efficiently. We aim to extend our strong track record of implementing incremental technological and collection
process improvements, which have contributed to enhanced performance and increased efficiency throughout our
business. For example, in the UK we are actively deploying technology through which we are able to more closely
tailor our contact to the consumer’s unique circumstances. In addition, on a Group-wide basis we are
implementing a multi-channel digital strategy to better connect with our consumers. We believe these initiatives
will improve the efficiency of our operations platform through cost reductions, increased collections or a
combination of these two effects. Sophisticated data analytics underpin our disciplined approach to pricing and
investment decisions, which we believe are an integral part of our strategy and which differentiate us from our
competition.

**_Develop Sustainable Competitive Advantage in Chosen Markets to Facilitate Continued Growth_**

Our strategy is to ultimately become the leading multi-product and multi-service provider of CMS
services in our chosen markets. We believe that we have a complementary set of competitive advantages across
the UK, DACH and Northern European regions that are essential to helping us achieve this objective. Our UK
Division is a leader in the UK CMS market and possesses one of the most sophisticated debt purchase platforms
in Europe. Our DACH Division is a leading player in the DACH debt purchase and third-party collection services
markets and provides our clients with a diversified service offering that harnesses our expertise in a range of CMS
services, including BPO and risk-management services. Our Northern European Division also has a leading
position in the Northern European CMS market, including BPO and risk-management services in the Northern


-----

European financial institutions client segment that possesses one of the most sophisticated debt purchasing and
collection platforms in the data-rich Northern European region. By sharing best practices within the Group and
utilizing our complementary competencies in debt purchasing and outsourced credit services, we believe the
strength of each of our divisions enables us to seize new opportunities to help us expand our offering both
geographically and throughout several key market sectors.

Our pricing discipline and systematic, objective pricing processes remain an integral part of our strategy
and lay the foundation for us to build a sustainable competitive advantage. We believe that as a result of our
pricing discipline, among other factors, we have been able to grow our asset base and profits, notwithstanding the
changing economic environment, and have maintained stable, strong and predictable overall returns on capital
across our sectors. We plan to continue to invest in our pricing methodologies and capitalize on the virtuous circle
by which the consumer profiles and collections data we gather each month continuously add to the accuracy and
sophistication of our systems and models. Moreover, since we make investment decisions at the Group level, we
believe we will be able to deploy our capital across the Group to wherever returns are most promising, which we
believe will contribute to our ability to maintain high returns on capital.

**_Continue to Invest in Our Employees and Corporate Culture_**

Our reputation is extremely important to us, both among our clients and among our employees. We search
for people with enthusiasm, passion and commitment and when we find them, we invest in them heavily in order
to deliver on our promises of connection, communication, development, involvement, recognition and reward.
They create the culture that defines our business, protects our reputation and drives our performance, and they
constitute the primary component of our consumers’ experience. We strive to build a unique corporate culture in
which our people are imbued with a sense of engagement and belonging. We believe that our focus on our people
and our efforts to build a unique corporate culture help to drive our collection performance and contribute to our
ability to provide an enhanced consumer experience.

**_Enter into Strategic Partnerships with Reputable Investors and Financial Institutions_**

In our debt purchasing segment, we see a pipeline in terms of the number and the size of investment
opportunities available, which is outpacing our on-balance sheet investment capacity. In such a scenario, coinvestment structures are opportunities for the Group to gain access to larger portfolios and build scale through
our ability to source, price and service unsecured consumer finance portfolios. We believe this will contribute to
an increase of the revenue from third-party servicing and help to better manage the Group’s financial profile by
adjusting exposure and overall allocation. In order to partner with well-established co-investors, the investors
must be confident that we are able to service the portfolio in an efficient and professional manner without any
conflict of interest or principal-agent problems.

We believe the ability to transact with established investors creates a unique advantage for the Group:

    - Expand purchasing capacity – ability to participate in larger deals across our markets with less
capital intensity;

    - Higher returns – opportunity to leverage servicing platforms (acting as servicer of portfolios) and
gain scale; and

    - Lower risk – ability to manage the risk versus return by adjusting own exposure depending on
market WACC and desired overall allocation, regardless of transaction sizes.

In January 2020, we entered into an NPL purchase agreement with German private bank Oldenburgische
Landesbank (OLB). Under the terms of the arrangement, we will procure NPLs in the DACH region for OLB, up
to an amount of €30 million per year. We will carry out debt collections and servicing on all debt portfolios
through a master servicing agreement, which will provide a new stream of future servicing income.

Also in January 2020, we entered into a co-investment partnership with a listed global asset manager
with Assets under Management and Administration (AuMA) of over £300 billion as of June 30, 2020. Under this
partnership, the global asset manager and the Group will acquire 90% and 10% interests, respectively, in nonperforming loan portfolios across the Group’s markets with targeted deployments of €300 million over a three
year period. The Group will carry out debt collections/servicing on all acquired portfolios through a master
servicing agreement providing a new stream of future servicing income.


-----

**_Strong Focus on Leverage and Funding Diversification_**

Prudent capital management is at the center of our financial policy.

We organically reduced the Group’s consolidated total net leverage ratio to 4.7x as of June 30, 2020, a
decrease of 0.4x since June 30, 2019, on the back of better front book returns and overall margin improvement
driven by strong cost control and slower overall spend. The consummation of the Transactions is expected to
further reduce overall leverage of the Group as of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, to a consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.6x. Due to our decision to temporarily pause new
litigation activity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect our Gross Debt Purchase Collections in 2020
to fall short of previous estimates and, notwithstanding COVID-19 related cost reduction measures, we expect
Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA to slightly decline in the year ending December 31, 2020 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2019 and, as a consequence, total net leverage to increase slightly during this period. See
_“—Recent Developments—COVID-19.” However, we expect the reduction in overall leverage to continue as we_
remain committed to our publicly stated leverage guidance of a consolidated total net leverage ratio in the range
of 4.0x to 3.5x by 2021-2022. Our deleveraging targets assume resumption of UK litigation activity from H2 2020
onwards and no further forbearance measures (either voluntary or government-imposed) in any of our regions.
While we believe our stated leverage guidance to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from these estimates
and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information and this
information may not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of the financial year or any future period.
See “Forward-Looking Statements.”

In addition, the Group is actively exploring alternative ways to fund growth. Recent examples include
our focus on growing our relatively less capital intense servicing segment and pursuing co-investment structure
opportunities, including our recent co-investment partnership with a listed global asset manager, which has
targeted deployments of €300 million to purchase non-performing loan portfolios over the next three years, as
well as a partnership with a bank managing over €20 billion in assets to carry out debt collections and servicing
on all owned debt portfolios. See “—Our Strategy—Enter into Strategic Partnerships with Reputable Investors
_and Financial Institutions.”_

As our pipeline of potential investment opportunities continues to outpace our on-balance sheet
investment capacity, co-investment structures present opportunities for the Group to access larger portfolios and
build scale by capitalizing on our ability to source, price and service unsecured consumer finance portfolios. We
expect this to drive increasing income from third-party servicing and to help better manage the Group’s financial
profile by improving the composition of our portfolio exposures and allocations. The ability to transact with
established investors presents a unique opportunity for the Group to (i) expand our purchasing capacity and our
ability to participate in larger deals across geographies with less capital intensity, (ii) generate higher returns and
create further opportunities to leverage our servicing platforms and gain scale and (iii) improve our risk/return
management and profile by adjusting our exposures depending on market WACC and desired allocation mix
regardless of transaction sizes.

**_Participate Opportunistically in Consolidation of our Industry when Accretive Opportunities Exist_**

We have a strong track record of selective and accretive expansion in the UK and Germany, as
demonstrated by our acquisition of IS Inkasso Service in May 2016, the Tesch Group in September 2016 and
Apontas in October 2016 and the Northern European Division from Intrum in April 2018 and Lucas Credit
Services in July 2019. Furthermore, the Group has a proven track record of successfully expanding by acquiring
carve-outs of the internal collections businesses of banks, insurers, telecoms and utility companies. In July 2020,
we announced the acquisition of Solvencia AS, which we believe will establish us as a leading 3PC player in
Norway, strengthen our 3PC business in Sweden and Finland and build up our Northern European Division’s
capability to collect small balance debts in Norway. The acquisition closed on October 1, 2020.

As our business continues to develop, we intend to continue to participate opportunistically in the
consolidation of the European CMS industry in order to build scale, address untapped consumer segments and
create new relationships with debt originators. We intend to strategically pursue further carve-out transactions
with current clients and credit-accretive bolt-on acquisitions. We will continue to apply our strong and disciplined
approach to valuation in connection with these potential acquisitions.

**Recent Developments**

**_COVID-19_**

In response to the spread of COVID-19, we promptly undertook a number of temporary initiatives to
safeguard our employees and ensure business continuity. We transitioned the vast majority our workforce to
remote working by early April 2020, and expect that a significant proportion of our workforce will continue to
work remotely for the foreseeable future. We proactively engage with our clients to maintain strong and mutually
beneficial relationships and are committed to working with our consumers to achieve affordable and sustainable
repayments and continue to focus on vulnerability checks. In response to the initial impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and possible related effects on our consumers, we took the decision to temporarily reduce our outbound
consumer contact activity and paused new legal collections activity in our UK Division.

We continue to benefit from scale and diversification, with our broad geographic reach and balanced
revenue mix between debt purchase and 3PC. We believe we operate leading platforms in mature Northern and
Western European markets where we hold significant data assets and deep client relationships, focusing on our
core competence of unsecured consumer debt, and managing approximately 22.2 million active accounts across
more than 4,281 owned debt portfolios as of June 30, 2020.

The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business and operating results will
depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We are continuing to
monitor developments relating to COVID-19 and are coordinating our operational responses based on existing
business continuity plans and guidance from global health organizations and relevant governments. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business and results of operations may be adversely_
_affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.”_

Our fundamentals and business model have proven resilient to date, and we remain optimistic about
opportunities for the medium and long term. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our
business and operating results will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately
predicted.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not finalized trading results for the three months
ended September 30, 2020. However, based on preliminary financial information, we estimate that, for the three
months ended September 30, 2020, our Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA was approximately £139 million an
increase of approximately 6% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, and our Group cash
income was approximately £228 million, a decrease of approximately 7% compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, our available liquidity was £303.0 million (including cash and
cash equivalents and available drawings under our other financing arrangements), compared to £285 million of
available liquidity (including cash, cash equivalents, available drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility and
available drawings under our other financing arrangements) as of September 30, 2019. In the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, our purchases of debt portfolios (measured as the amount of cash payments made in such
period) was £180 million, a decrease of approximately 35% compared to the prior year nine-month period.

Gross Debt Purchase Collections have shown good resilience since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,
however, since April 2020, we experienced a reduction in total Gross Debt Purchase Collections when compared
with our forecast Gross Debt Purchase Collections expectations on portfolios owned by the Group as of December
31, 2019 (the “static pool”). For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our Gross Debt Purchase Collections
on the static pool amounted to approximately 93% of our forecast. This reduction has largely been driven by the
impact on our UK Division of management decisions taken to temporarily reduce outbound consumer contact
activity and pause new legal collections. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, collections for our UK
Division were at 83%, 84% and 86% of forecasted expectations against the static pool in July, August and
September respectively, trailing our DACH and Northern European Divisions. We believe that approximately
90% of this shortfall was due to conscious measures on the part of our management.

Since June 2020, our UK Division has increased outbound consumer contact activity and since August
2020 has resumed new legal collections, with the intention of increasing the division’s future Gross Debt Purchase
Collections, which increased to 86% of forecast expectations in September 2020.


-----

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our UK Division’s Gross Debt Purchase Collections on
accounts with a payment plan in place as of December 31, 2019 (the “paying base”) performed at 96% of our
forecast for paying-base accounts. As of September 30, 2020, we have not experienced a material change in the
percentage of collections coming from payment plans due to COVID-19, with payments from plans representing
80% of our UK Division’s total Gross Debt Purchase Collections for the nine-month period.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we do not expect the pandemic to have a significant impact
on our 120M ERC, as we believe that collections will be deferred rather than lost, and we believe we will be able
to achieve projected Gross Debt Purchase Collections over the 120-month period. However, the circumstances
around this pandemic are evolving and will continue to impact our business and estimation of expected Gross
Debt Purchase Collections in future periods. We continue to assess the impact on our collections forecasts and,
although we did not recognize material impairments to our owned debt portfolios due to COVID-19 for the three
months ended September 30, 2020, it cannot be ruled out that such impairments will impact our net portfolio
write-up for future periods.

In the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recognized an £11 million net portfolio write down,
representing 0.7% of the Group’s Portfolio Book Value. The net portfolio write down principally reflected the
impact of the expected delay to a proportion of our UK Division’s collections as a result of the management
actions undertaken. In the three months ended September 30, 2020, our UK Division’s Gross Debt Purchase
Collections performance has been 102% of our June 30, 2020, forecast.

We expect our Gross Debt Purchase Collections for full year 2020 to fall short of previous estimates and,
notwithstanding COVID-19 related cost reduction measures, we expect Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA to slightly
decline in the year ending December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 principally as a
result of lower Portfolio Purchases and a delay in Gross Debt Purchases Collections due to the management actions
taken in our UK Division. Cost control and increasing operational leverage continue to be a key focus for the
Group. The Group’s Adjusted Cash EBITDA margin for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 was 57%,
an increase of 600 basis points on the prior twelve-month period. Margin expansion has been driven by increased
operational leverage of our indirect cost base together with improved collections efficiency. We continue to focus
on customer care, reflected in our very strong Trustpilot score of 4.4/5. Digital channels continue to perform
strongly, supporting customer engagement and collections and contributing to more efficient collections. We
estimate the temporary reduction in legal fees related to litigation activities to have contributed to short term
margin expansion of approximately 2%. Additional cost initiatives have been enacted in Q4-20, these are
principally focused on further indirect cost efficiency to support sustainable margin expansion of approximately
300bps over the next 24 months.

As a consequence of the timing of portfolio purchases, we expect total net leverage to increase slightly
during this period. However, we expect the reduction in overall leverage to continue as we remain committed to
our publicly stated leverage guidance of a consolidated total net leverage ratio in the range of 4.0x to 3.5x by
2021-2022. While we believe our stated leverage guidance to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from
these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this
information and this information may not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of the financial year
or any future period.

We continue to pragmatically assess the purchasing landscape and prioritize cash management, IRRs and
liquidity. We expect to see significant increases in the volume of NPL write-offs in the near and medium term
compared to 2019 in our regions and among our clients, which we expect will lead to significant near- and
medium-term opportunities for debt portfolio purchases. We also expect that an overall increase in NPLs will lead
to an increase in 3PC opportunities. We expect to purchase approximately £300 million of debt portfolios during
2020.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we expect to have drawn the equivalent of £    million
under the Revolving Credit Facility, compared to £403.4 million as of June 30, 2020, having decreased our
utilization between July 1, 2020 and the date of this Offering Memorandum in order to reduce our cash position.
We continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure, including through monitoring the capital
markets.

The preliminary financial results as of and for the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2020 presented above have not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors, nor have any procedures
been performed by our independent auditors with respect thereto. Such information has been derived from
management accounts, is preliminary and is subject to our financial closing procedures, which have not yet been


-----

completed. While we believe these preliminary results and estimates to be reasonable, our actual results could
vary from these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance
on this information and this information may not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of the financial
year or any future period. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”.

least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes
(including any additional notes) remains outstanding after the
redemption.

**Additional Amounts;**
**Tax Redemption ................................... Any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in**

respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee will be made
without withholding or deduction for taxes in any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Withholding
_Taxes”) unless required by law. Subject to certain exceptions and_
limitations, if the Issuer, any Guarantor or the Paying Agent is required
by law to withhold or deduct such taxes with respect to a payment on any
Note, the Issuer or that Guarantor will pay the Additional Amounts (as


-----

defined in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) necessary so
that the net amount received by each holder after such withholding or
deduction is not less than the amount that would have been received in
the absence of the withholding or deduction.

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction become
effective after the issuance of the Notes that would impose withholding
taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Notes, and would
require the Issuer or any Guarantor to pay Additional Amounts, the Issuer
may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation
_Reasons.”_

**Change of Control ............................... Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer**

may be required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase. However, a change of control will be deemed not to have
occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in
connection with such event. For further information, see “Description of
_the Notes.”_

**Certain Covenants ............................... The Indenture among other things, restricts or will restrict the ability of**

the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined therein), to:

                    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                    - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                    - make certain other restricted payments;

                    - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                    - impose restrictions on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to
pay dividends;

                    - transfer or sell certain assets;

                    - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                    - impair the security interests created for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the Notes obtain and
maintain an investment-grade rating.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture are or will be subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**Transfer Restrictions ........................... The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be,**

registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. The Issuer and each of the Guarantors has not been and will
not be registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act, in reliance on
the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(7) thereof. The Notes are subject
to restrictions on transferability and resale. See “Transfer Restrictions.”
We have not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Notes


-----

under the securities laws in any jurisdiction (including by way of an
exchange offer).

**OID ....................................................... The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S.**

federal income tax purposes. In the event that the Sterling Notes, the
Floating Rate Euro Notes or the Fixed Rate Euro Notes are issued with
OID, U.S. holders (as defined under “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations”) of such series of Notes issued with OID_
generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as
ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual
method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. As a result, such U.S. holders generally will include
any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such
income. See “Taxation—Certain _U.S._ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_
_Considerations—Original Issue Discount.”_

**No Established Market**
**for the Notes ......................................... The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no**

established trading market. Although certain of the Initial Purchasers
have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are
not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market making at any
time without notice. Accordingly, there is no assurance that an active
trading market will develop for the Notes.

**Listing and Trading ............................. Application will be made to admit the Notes to listing on the Official List**

of the Exchange in accordance with the rules thereof.

**Governing Law .................................... The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be governed by**

the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the
application to the Notes of the provisions set out in articles 470-3 to 47019 of the Luxembourg law on commercial companies dated August 10,
1915, as amended, is excluded. The Intercreditor Agreement and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are governed by English law (other
than the covenants schedule, the defaults schedule and the related defined
terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which shall be
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York). The
security documents will be governed by the applicable law of the
jurisdiction under which the security interests are granted, including
English law, German law, Jersey law, Luxembourg law, Finnish law,
Danish law, Swedish law and Norwegian law.

Offering Memorandum and, in particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set forth in the “Risk
_Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum before making a decision whether to invest in the Notes._

**SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION OF THE GROUP**

_The following tables summarize the Group’s historical consolidated financial data as of and for the years_
_ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 and should be read_
_in conjunction with the Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which are reproduced elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum, and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Where financial data in the following tables is labeled_
_“audited,” this means that it has been taken from the Audited Group Consolidated Financial Statements_
_mentioned above. The label “unaudited” is used in the following tables to indicate financial data that has not_
_been taken from the Audited Group Consolidated Financial Statements but rather was taken from the Unaudited_
_Group Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or the Issuer’s internal reporting system, or has_
_been calculated based on figures from these sources, as applicable. The information below is not necessarily_
_indicative of the results of future operations._

_The income statement figures for the year ended_ _December 31, 2017 included in the following tables are_
_derived from the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements where the prior year comparative figures as of_
_and for the year ended December 31, 2017 were retrospectively adjusted to reclassify net portfolio write-up under_
_income for consistency with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2018 following the adoption of_
_IFRS 9. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies—_
_Reclassification of prior year presentation” to the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements._

_On March 20, 2018, we acquired Lowell Sverige (formerly Lindorff Sverige) and Lowell AS (formerly_
_Fair Pay Please) (together with their respective subsidiaries), and their results have been consolidated with the_
_Group’s beginning April 1, 2018. As a result, the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 are not_
_directly comparable to those for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2019._

_The summary financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was derived by adding_
_the condensed consolidated interim financial information of the Parent for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to_
_the consolidated financial information of the Parent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and then subtracting_
_the consolidated interim financial information of the Parent for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This twelve-_
_month data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary_
_course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. The financial_
_information for the six months or twelve months ended June 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results_
_that may be expected for any future period, including the year ending December 31, 2020, and should not be used_
_as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation._

_We present below certain non-IFRS measures and ratios that are not required by or presented in_
_accordance with IFRS, including Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA and ERC, among others. There can be no_
_assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar_
_items will not be incurred in the future. The non-IFRS measures are not measurements of financial performance_
_under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash_
_flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS measures as_
_presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures_
_used by other companies, and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA may differ from “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined_
_in the “Description of the Notes” section of this Offering Memorandum, the Indenture and the Existing Indentures._
_The calculations for the non-IFRS measures are based on various assumptions. This information is inherently_
_subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or_
_results of operations for the periods presented and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision._
_See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”_

_The historical data or unaudited pro forma financial information below is not necessarily indicative of_
_results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,”_
_“Selected Group Consolidated Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Description of the Notes” and the notes related thereto_
_included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future_
_expected results._

(1) “120M ERC” means estimated remaining collections, which are the future collections projected to be received on the Group’s owned
debt portfolios based on its forecasting models. 120M ERC is the combined Group’s ERC over a 120-month period, with our DACH
and Northern European Divisions’ contributions translated into pounds sterling at the applicable rate, and is presented for illustrative
purposes only. 120M ERC is not intended to be a projection of future results. Future results may vary significantly from the results
reflected in the above table because of various factors, including those discussed in “Risk Factors.”

(2) “Portfolio purchases” represents the value of debt portfolios acquired during the period, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet.

(3) “Number of active accounts” represents the total number of active accounts (defined as accounts from which we expect to generate
further collections) that the Group owns as of the date specified. “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-Financial
_Operating Data.”_

(4) “Number of owned debt portfolios” represents the number of individual owned debt portfolios that the Group owns as of the date
specified.


-----

(5) “Net adjusted debt” represents third-party debt (excluding accrued interest and subordinated shareholder instruments included under
“non-current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash).

(a) Includes amounts outstanding under the Group’s asset-backed securitization programs. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Group had two securitization programs outstanding. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Securitization Programs.”_

(6) “Gross Debt Purchase Collections” represents actual amounts collected from owned debt portfolios including put backs and, in the
case of our DACH Division, after tax payments for VAT and insurance. Gross Debt Purchase Collections also include consideration
received for the sale of our own debt portfolios from time to time, which represents an immaterial share of our Group cash income.

(7) “3PC income” represents income derived from the provision of third-party collection services. Lawyer service revenue is not included
in Group cash income, as this revenue is generated on a largely pass-through basis, with costs incurred in connection with lawyer service
revenue generally slightly exceeding such revenue.

(8) “Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA” represents Gross Debt Purchase Collections plus other turnover, less collection activity costs and
other expenses (which, together, equals servicing costs) and before exceptional items, depreciation, amortization and impairment of nonperforming loans. We use Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA as a measure of operating cash flow generation. For additional information,
see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-Financial Operating Data.” The following tables provide an analysis of
Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA.

The table below sets out the reconciliation of net cash generated by / (used in) operating activities to Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA.

(1) Unless otherwise indicated, euro-denominated amounts for the DACH or Northern European Divisions were translated into pound
sterling on a month by month basis at the average applicable exchange rate for each month.

(2) We define 120M ERC as the ERC projections for the Group based on a 120-month period.

(3) Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA represents Gross Debt Purchase Collections plus other turnover, less collection activity costs and other
expenses (which, together, equals servicing costs) and before exceptional items, depreciation, amortization and impairment of nonperforming loans. For a reconciliation of Gross Debt Purchase Collections and operating profit to Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA, see
footnote 8 to “—Other Group Financial and Operating Data” above. For additional information, see “Summary Consolidated Financial
_and Other Information of the Group” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-Financial Operating Data.”_

(4) We define Group Pro forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA as Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA plus adjustments related to the run-rate effects
of completed M&A and run-rate cost savings from restructuring and redundancies.

The Group does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future revenues, earnings, or other results. However, the
management of the Group has prepared the prospective financial information adjusted for this non-IFRS measure to present the efficiency
initiatives and cost savings estimated to be realized. The accompanying prospective financial information was not prepared with a view
toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the International Federation of Accountants
with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of the Group’s management, was prepared on a reasonable basis,
reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the
expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of the Group. However, this information is not fact and should
not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this offering memorandum are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on the prospective financial information. Neither the Group’s independent auditors, nor any other independent
accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained
herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no
responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.

The table below sets out the reconciliation of Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA to Group Pro forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2020.

**Twelve months ended June**

**30, 2020**
**(unaudited)**
**(£ millions)**
**Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA ..............................................................................................................** **512.7**
Run-rate effects of completed M&A[(a)] ....................................................................................................... 3.3
Run-rate cost savings from restructuring and redundancies[(b)] ................................................................... 5.6

**Group Pro forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA ............................................................................................** **521.6**

(a) Represents adjustments of £3.4 million due to the acquisition of Solvencia AS partially offset by £(0.1) million divestiture of our
Estonian business unit in August 2019.

(b) Represents adjustments of £1.3 million in cost savings due to the closure of Fredrickson in the UK and £4.3 million in cost savings

due to restructuring initiatives across our divisions (with £2.6 million in our UK Division, £1.4 million in our DACH Division and
£0.3 million in our Northern European Division).

The estimates presented above with respect to the run-rate effects of completed M&A and run-rate cost savings from restructuring and
redundancies have been prepared using current estimates and taking into account certain assumptions about future operations, including
overall performance and macroeconomic conditions. There can be no assurance that these completed mergers and acquisitions or
restructurings and redundancies will have the desired outcomes and the costs associated with achieving them may outweigh any benefits.
The foregoing assumptions underlying the adjustments involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or
performance to be materially different from anticipated future results or performance expressed or implied by such adjustments.

(5) We define Group cash income as Gross Debt Purchase Collections plus income from 3PC services. Group cash income represents our
cash collections from owned debt portfolios plus cash commissions received from 3PC portfolios serviced. Lawyer service revenue is
not included in Group cash income, as this revenue is generated on a largely pass-through basis, with costs incurred in connection with
lawyer service revenue generally slightly exceeding such revenue. See “—Group cash income by segment for the twelve months ended
_June 30, 2020” below._

(6) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents represents cash and cash equivalents of the Group as of June 30, 2020, as adjusted for the Offering
(including the expected use of proceeds thereof), and excluding £66.9 million in restricted cash. As of June 30, 2020, we had £240.0
million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding £66.9 million in restricted cash. See “Capitalization.”

(7) As adjusted secured debt represents outstanding third-party indebtedness of the Group, excluding amounts outstanding under the Luigi
Securitization and the Milla Securitization, as adjusted for the Refinancing as of the Issue Date. As of June 30, 2020, the Revolving
Credit Facility was drawn in the amount of the euro equivalent of £403.4 million. As of the Issue Date, we expect we will have the
equivalent of £      million drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility.

(8) As adjusted net secured debt represents as adjusted secured debt, which excludes amounts outstanding under the Luigi Securitization
and the Milla Securitization, less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents (net of £66.9 million in restricted cash).

(9) As adjusted total debt represents outstanding third-party indebtedness of the Group, including amounts outstanding under the Luigi
Securitization and the Milla Securitization, as adjusted for the Refinancing.

(10) As adjusted net total debt represents as adjusted total debt, which includes amounts outstanding under the Luigi Securitization and the

Milla Securitization, less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents (net of £66.9 million in restricted cash).

(11) As adjusted cash interest expense reflects the interest expense in respect of the Floating Rate Euro Notes, based on a margin

of           % and assuming a constant EURIBOR rate (with a 0% floor), the interest expense in respect of the Fixed Rate Euro Notes,
based on an interest rate of           %, the interest expense in respect of the Sterling Notes, fees under our Revolving Credit Facility
(excluding any interest on drawings in the ordinary course of business) and fees under our securitization programs for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2020 as if the Refinancing had occurred on July 1, 2019. As adjusted cash interest expense excludes charges related to
allocated debt issuance costs and hedging costs. As adjusted cash interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and

does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the Refinancing occurred on the date assumed, nor
does it purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained_
_in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the_
_Notes. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our_
_business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the events described below were to occur, our_
_business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens,_
_the trading prices of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when_
_due and you could lose all or part of your investment. The order in which these risks are presented is not intended_
_to provide an indication of the likelihood of their occurrence or their severity or significance._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains “forward-looking” statements that may be based on_
_assumptions and estimates that are subject to further risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ_
_materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including,_
_but not limited to, the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. For further information,_
_see “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

_As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the near-, medium- or long-term impact of COVID-19 on_
_our business and our industry remains uncertain due to numerous evolving factors that we are unable to predict_
_and may exacerbate the risks set forth herein. As such, our historical financial condition and results of operations_
_as of or for any historical period is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future_
_period. See “—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business and results of operations may be_
_adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.”_

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**_Changes in the economic environment, in particular in the countries in which we operate, may have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our financial condition, financial returns and results of operations._**

We currently operate mainly in the UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Austria and
Switzerland (together “our core markets”). Consequently we are exposed to changes in economic or fiscal
conditions in each of our core markets and we are also exposed to any changes in the global macroeconomic
environment affecting economic conditions in our core markets. If the global economy suffers a prolonged,
material downturn that affects the markets we operate in through, among other things, an increase in the
unemployment rate, increased inflation, the implementation of enhanced austerity measures (such as reduction in
the relevant government’s provisions of public benefits and/or public sector employment), reduced disposable
income, impacting interest rates, and the availability of credit, consumers may be unable or unwilling to continue
repaying debt, and we may not be able to perform debt collection in a manner consistent with our past practice. If
our consumers experience a reduced ability or willingness to pay their debt, we could face increased servicing
costs and lower average payments, thereby reducing our cash generation and returns on capital, and, in turn, our
ERC. Even if we are able to develop tailored payment plans for certain of the affected consumers in order to try
to reduce the number of defaults, such measures may prove unsuccessful, or if the measures are successful in
avoiding some defaults, total collections may be reduced or the timing of receipt of payments may be extended as
a result of these measures.

Additionally, adverse economic conditions could lead to a reduction in the propensity of financial
institutions or other credit institutions to lend to corporations and individuals, as was the case during the global
financial crisis of 2008 - 2009. This, in turn, could lead to a reduced supply of debt available for collection or
fewer opportunities for us in our debt purchase business. Reduced lending by financial or other credit institutions
may also negatively affect consumers by reducing disposable income levels or otherwise impairing their ability
to fulfill their payment obligations. Furthermore, such a reduction in the propensity of financial institutions or
other credit institutions to lend to corporations could adversely affect our own ability to obtain credit, and this
may adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition by, inter alia, limiting our ability
to finance portfolio purchases on financially favorable terms, or at all.

An improvement in the economic conditions in our markets could have both positive and negative
impacts on our business. Although improved economic conditions may lead to higher debt repayment due to the
improved financial position of our consumers, this may also lead to more competitive pricing expectations for the
debt portfolios that we purchase or for the debt collection services that we offer because of improved payment
prospects. In addition, rising interest rates due to a change in the economic environment or other factors beyond


-----

our control may increase our financing costs, which may result in our inability to make required capital
investments or finance debt portfolio purchases on financially favorable terms or at all.

Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We are subject to EU, UK, German and Norwegian regulations, among others, and changes to the regulatory_**
**_environment or a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, authorizations, licenses and codes of_**
**_practice may negatively affect our business._**

As a business operating in the EU, UK, Germany and Norway, we are subject to a variety of national and
EU regulations, including laws and regulations regarding data privacy, anti-money laundering and counter
terrorist financing, unfair competition, customer treatment, and price fixing. In case of non-compliance, the
relevant authorities may, inter alia, impose a fine (on the business or senior management), public censure and
remove or restrict an entity’s license. Furthermore, adverse regulatory developments under any of the laws and
regulations applicable to our operations could expose us to a number of risks. Individual employees may act
against our instructions and either inadvertently or deliberately violate applicable laws, including competition
laws and regulations by engaging in prohibited activities such as price fixing or colluding with competitors
regarding markets or clients. Such actions may harm our reputation and, if we are held responsible, the resulting
fines and other sanctions could be substantial. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our UK Division, our DACH Division and our Northern European Division are also subject to various
complex laws and regulations that are more specifically related to the CMS industry. See “Regulation” for
additional information.

_Regulations affecting our UK Division_

Our UK debt collection business is conducted through a number of subsidiaries. On April 1, 2014, the
Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) took over the regulation of consumer credit activities (as defined in the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001), including related debt purchase and
debt collection activity, from the Office of Fair Trading (the “OFT”). All relevant UK Division companies now
have such full FCA authorization.

Our entities in the UK that collect debt due to third parties or collect debt that we have purchased under
regulated consumer credit agreements are required to demonstrate that they continue to meet the FCA’s threshold
conditions to maintain their authorization. In addition, certain individuals within the firm who exercise a “senior
management function” in the business of the firm must be approved by the FCA as “Senior Managers.” These
individuals must demonstrate on an ongoing basis that they are fit, proper and competent to hold the position of a
“Senior Manager” and they must also comply with the FCA’s Senior Manager and Individual Conduct Rules as
set out in the COCON Chapter of the FCA Handbook. The Senior Managers and Certification Regime
(“SM&CR”) came into force in December 2019, replacing the former Approved Persons Regime, with an
increased focus on individual accountability.

The three main elements of the SM&CR apply to every firm: (i) the Senior Managers Regime (which
focuses on the most senior people in the firm who must have a statement of responsibilities and be pre-approved
by the FCA to hold their function), (ii) the Certification Regime (which covers roles that have a big impact on
customers, markets or the firm for whom the firm must certify that they are suitable to do their job at least annually)
and (iii) Conduct Rules which apply to almost every person who works in financial services, and include things
like “acting with integrity” and “treating customers fairly.”

In addition to its broad fitness and proprietary requirements and the overarching requirements of the
FCA’s Principles for Business, the FCA has created a sector specific Consumer Credit sourcebook (“CONC”)
within the FCA Handbook which applies specifically to firms undertaking credit related activities and activities
connected to those activities such as ours. CONC sets out detailed standards, in the form of specific rules and
guidance.

A properly authorized debt collection (or other consumer credit) business is also affected by, or subject
to, numerous detailed legislative requirements, principally contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the
“CCA”) and secondary legislation made under the CCA, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations


-----

1999 (the “UTCCRs”) and the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (the “CRA”). These legal requirements oblige creditors
to, among other things:

    - provide consumers with prescribed forms of pre-contractual documentation;

    - provide consumers with prescribed credit agreement documentation at the outset;

    - enable consumers to obtain copies of credit agreement documentation;

    - provide consumers with prescribed forms of post-contractual statements and notices;

    - provide a “fair relationship” between themselves and the consumer; and

    - ensure that their agreements do not contain unfair terms (and stipulate that any unfair terms are
void).

A failure to comply with these requirements have differing consequences, but include causing
agreements or certain terms to be deemed unenforceable either without a court order or until issues of noncompliance have been remedied (meaning that in some cases the outstanding debt and interest cannot be
recovered). This could affect our ability to recover on the accounts underlying our owned debt portfolios in the
UK or restrict important rights that we rely on. An agreement could be deemed unenforceable when we, as the
debt collector or purchaser of the debt, or the originator, fail to comply with the applicable requirements.

Failure to comply with any of these rules or guidance issued by the FCA may have serious consequences,
for example:

    - The FCA may take enforcement action against a firm which could result in fines, public censure,
the withdrawal of regulatory authorization and/or remediation action for consumers. Any such
enforcement action would be publicly known and would involve severe reputational damage.
Vendors of debt portfolios and creditors outsourcing collection activity may consider or be
required to remove their business from a debt purchaser or collector that is the subject of such
enforcement action;

    - Firms can be subject to a section 166 notice from the FCA, which may ensue where the FCA has
identified issues within the firm regarding non-compliance with the FCA rules and guidance.
Pursuant to a section 166 notice, the FCA either commissions, or requires the firm to commission,
a “skilled persons” report. A “skilled persons” report is performed by an independent firm, usually
an audit or law firm that is deemed by the FCA to have the necessary skills and expertise to review
the areas of concern. The report is shared with the firm being reviewed and the FCA, which may
decide to take enforcement action in relation to any weaknesses identified. Remedial action
highlighted is tracked by the FCA through close liaison with the firm. Failure to remedy points
raised and/or do so in sufficient time can lead to further enforcement action including fines. The
cost of such a review is borne by the firm. A section 166 notice may become publicly available
and we may be contractually obliged to notify clients should we become subject to such a notice.
Clients may then consider, or be required, to remove their business from us, and consequently, our
ability to win future business may be adversely affected. We might also be required, or otherwise
decide, to introduce changes to our business practices in the UK in response to enforcement action
taken against some of our competitors which highlights certain practices which are of concern to
the regulator.

The FCA regards debt collection (and debt purchasing) as a “high risk” sector based on the financial
position of the consumers involved and issues of customer detriment, vulnerability and hardship are key areas of
focus for the regulator.

While we are not currently a subscriber to the Standards of Lending Practice (previously the Lending
Code), a number of our clients in the UK are banks, and as such they must ensure that the third parties they use
offer standards that meet the requirements of the Standards of Lending Practice. Furthermore, we may be subject
to contractual obligations to observe certain requirements to ensure that our UK operations are conducted in a way
that is consistent with certain FCA rules or requirements and certain provisions of the Standards of Lending
Practice, including, for example, being subject to audits by debt originators.


-----

In addition, our UK debt collection (and broader consumer credit) business is subject to an obligation to
act fairly, as set out in the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Breach of certain of these
regulations is a criminal offence. From October 1, 2014 consumers have also had a right of redress for misleading
or aggressive commercial practices.

Consumers who believe they have suffered as a result of our breaching these rules, or any of the
applicable FCA rules, may complain to us first, and if we do not uphold their complaint, or we do not respond
with the timescales stipulated under FCA rules, they may refer the matter to the UK Financial Ombudsman Service
(the “FOS”), which acts as an independent adjudicator of the consumer complaints in respect of FCA & CCA
regulated accounts. The FOS makes a decision based on what is fair and reasonable and good practice rather than
strictly on the basis of compliance with the law. FOS cases attract a fee, which is paid by the business against
whom the complaint is made, whether or not the complaint is upheld against the business (FOS do not charge a
business for the first 25 cases that they deal with during the year).

In certain situations we outsource some of our accounts to third party DCAs. This is usually as a result
of our own internal collection activity coming to an end. Generally, the use of DCAs may represent one of the
more significant conduct risks faced by us because, regardless of this outsourcing, we retain responsibility for the
treatment of the customer and compliance with the applicable rules and therefore we deploy additional controls
to monitor these DCAs. To the extent these third parties violate laws or other regulatory requirements in their
collection efforts in the UK, it could also negatively impact our business by harming our reputation or, in some
cases, resulting in penalties being directly imposed on us, as the FCA expects businesses to carefully select third
parties with which they work and take responsibility for ensuring their compliance over the outsourced activity.

We currently outsource in the UK to DCAs on a contingent basis. Although they are subject to quality
checks to monitor that fair outcomes are being achieved, the DCAs are paid a commission based on collections
achieved. Any change in laws or regulations restricting or prohibiting this practice of contingent collections could
result in a change in our arrangements with DCAs in the UK to less variable cost structures, such as fixed fee
arrangements. This would increase our fixed cost base, thereby causing our collection costs to rise without
necessarily increasing collections. If such change of law or regulations were implemented in relation to the debt
purchase and collection industries, this could negatively affect our ability to operate any DCA outsourcing
successfully using our current outsourcing model in the UK, which could have an adverse effect on our financial
returns and results of operations. We are not currently aware of any such proposal in relation to DCAs or other
participants in the debt purchase and collection industries.

Changes to the UK laws and regulations that affect us, or changes in the manner in which these laws and
regulations are interpreted, could also negatively affect our operations or increase our cost of regulatory
compliance.

In October 2015, Lowell Solicitors Limited, a subsidiary, was granted a legal services license by the
Solicitor’s Regulation Authority (the “SRA”) to undertake debt recovery litigation. Whilst this improves the
operational efficiency of our debt recovery litigation, it also brings additional oversight and regulatory compliance
requirements by the SRA.

With the FCA as the regulator of consumer credit businesses, the regulatory focus is on requiring lenders
(and debt collectors) to exercise “forbearance” in relation to consumer debt, to accept only affordable repayment
offers and to have regard at all times to the “treating the customer fairly” principle underpinning the regulatory
approach, in order to achieve fair consumer outcomes. This regulatory focus, which has gained increased
importance in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, may have a detrimental impact on the profitability of issuing
credit and the supply of debt portfolios for sale as well as increasing the oversight expectation of lenders who sell
or outsource. A reduction in debt portfolios offered for sale in the UK market may lead to increased prices and
lower returns on our investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

In April and July 2020, the FCA provided guidance that regulated firms should provide tailored
forbearance to customers, including 90 day payment deferrals that could be granted until the October 31, 2020.
This was subsequently updated, with effect from October 2, 2020, such that customers who have received payment
deferrals under the above guidance or who are experiencing payment difficulties as a result of circumstances
relating to COVID-19 should continue to be treated fairly and the organizations should work with the affected
customers to resolve any difficulties in advance of payments being missed or who continue to experience financial
difficulties either currently or following a period of forbearance.


-----

_Regulations affecting our DACH Division_

The CMS industry could be subject to increased scrutiny due to political factors, which could lead to
changes in laws and regulations in Germany or the European Union. Changes in these laws and regulations, or
changes to their interpretation by the relevant supervisory authorities and courts, may reduce our DACH
Division’s operational flexibility and limit its ability to use its consumer data to price portfolios and create efficient
debt collection strategies and regulate the fees, or potential setoffs of fees, charged to the consumer as part of a
creditor’s default damage (Verzugsschaden), for example, under German law. In Germany, the regulatory
framework for debt collection has been tightened by the Act Against Dubious Business Practices (Gesetz gegen
_unseriöse Geschäftspraktiken) which came into force in October 2013. Under this regulation,_ _inter alia, the_
reimbursement of costs for debt collection is limited, and the costs may not exceed the amount a lawyer would be
entitled to claim as compensation for a corresponding activity.

Recently, the German government has published and introduced into the legislative process a “Draft law
to improve consumer protection in debt collection law (Gesetz zur Verbesserung des Verbraucherschutzes im
_Inkassorecht und zur Änderung weiterer Vorschriften).” The “Draft law to improve consumer protection in debt_
collection law” published by the German government would further tighten the regulatory framework for debt
collection. The draft law foresees, inter alia, a reduction of the debt collection costs that are reimbursable by the
creditor in certain cases. The current draft provides for an average reduction by approximately 30% but this would
vary with the actual activities performed and the size of the claim. For very small claims (up to EUR 50.00), based
on our current activities, the reduction could be approximately 55%. If the bill is passed by the German legislator
in this form, it could have a material adverse effect on our DACH Division’s business, results of operations or
financial condition.

The Federal Association of German Debt Collectors (BDIU) has adopted a Code of Conduct that will
enter into force at whatever time the “Draft law to improve consumer protection in debt collection law” proposed
by the German government enters into force. The Code of Conduct will be binding on its member companies,
including for the subsidiaries of SIR, GPP, PCS, IBW, ZYK, GCG, Tesch Inkasso Forderungsmanagement
GmbH, Tesch Inkasso Finance GmbH, Tesch mediafinanz GmbH and Apontas GmbH & Co. KG. .

Furthermore, a recent decision of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) of March 14,
2019 (case no. 4 StR 426/18) implies that in certain standardized debt collection processes, only a certain reduced
amount of costs are reimbursable (however, the scope of this decision remains to be clarified).

On September 9, 2020, the German parliament (Bundestag) debated a first reading of a draft bill
presented by the German government on further shortening the residual debt discharge procedure (Entwurf eines
_Gesetzes zur weiteren Verkürzung des Restschuldbefreiungsverfahrens) and subsequently referred it to the lead_
committee for legal and consumer protection for further discussion. The law is proposed to enter into force
retroactively from October 1, 2020 and will enable natural persons being insolvency debtors, under certain
circumstances, to be discharged from residual debt within 3 years (currently 5 years). The law shall apply to own
applications by consumers, self-employed persons or former self-employed persons. Debtors who have filed their
insolvency applications since December 17, 2019 may also benefit from this reduction retroactively and may also
be able to obtain residual debt discharge in October 2023. The latter is still disputed, as the government draft had
initially spoken of a residual debt discharge in July 2025 for these proceedings.

In our current business model, our DACH Division generally attempts, in line with best practices in our
industry, to achieve recovery of the full amount under the German statutory regime and applicable civil law.
Income derived from these amounts, including as a result of lawyer service revenue, form a significant portion of
Group cash income and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA. Depending on a variety of factors, including legal
developments or reputational risks, we may alter our fee policies, which may impact the amount of fees that we
can charge to our and our clients’ customers in Germany. Such alterations may limit our Gross Debt Purchase
Collections and available cash and may have an adverse effect on our business. Changes in laws and regulations
in particular in Germany or the European Union, or further developments in or changes to their interpretation by
supervisory authorities and courts, including limits on the types and amounts of fees (including statutory fees) we
and/or external lawyers can pass on to consumers (or a prohibition of such fees) and restrictions on our DACH
Division’s ability to perform services for external lawyers could also affect the permissibility of our DACH
Division’s business model. In particular, several of the regulations to which our DACH Division is subject and
our interpretations thereof are based on a limited number of court decisions that are not all reconcilable. If court
decisions in the future hold more consistently against our positions, our DACH Division’s business model could
be adversely affected. Any change in these regulations, court decisions, or our interpretations thereof, and any
other factors mentioned above may have a material adverse effect on our operations, business or financial position.


-----

By regulation under the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für
_Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), companies operating in certain industries are not allowed to sell their overdue and_
defaulted receivables to third parties (e.g., in the insurance industry for premiums). While it is prohibited to
purchase their debt, we may provide these companies with up-front payments accounted for as purchased debt,
which are made after the receivables have been transferred for service to our DACH Division. In exchange for
providing up-front payment, we receive all further collections as a success fee. Such up-front payments only
reflect a portion of what a similar debt portfolio may cost in an open market purchase, as our DACH Division
purchases only the economic right to collect on a portfolio of debt, not full title to the underlying debt. However,
it cannot be excluded that a debt servicing transaction including a third-party collection provider fee may be
interpreted by the German regulator to be an unlawful sale or purchase of defaulted consumer debt, which may
therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or reputation.

Our DACH Division’s debt collection business may also be adversely affected by future supervisory and
regulatory restrictions or qualifications. In particular, if the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority
(Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) were to revise its interpretation of the relevant provision of the
German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz—KWG) such that the ongoing purchase of receivables that are already
due and payable qualifies as factoring, _i.e., the ongoing purchase of receivables in a commercial manner, and_
consequently also qualifies as the provision of financial services, our DACH Division’s debt collection business
could become subject to potentially costly or burdensome licensing requirements under the German Banking Act.

Furthermore, our Group’s companies that operate in Germany are allowed to conduct our debt collection
business only if they are registered under the German Legal Services Act (Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz) which
requires proof of aptitude and reliability, theoretical and practical expertise in the area of the legal services to be
provided and professional liability insurance coverage. As of the date hereof, our subsidiaries SIR, GPP, PCS,
IBW, ZYK, GCG, Tesch Inkasso Forderungsmanagement GmbH, Tesch Inkasso Finance GmbH, Tesch
mediafinanz GmbH and Apontas GmbH & Co. KG are registered under the German Legal Services Act. If we
fail to maintain these licenses, the relevant supervising authority may temporarily prohibit the companies
implicated from conducting further debt collections. The supervising authority may also entirely revoke the
registration for certain reasons, e.g., if our related insurance coverage is terminated or insufficient. Inability to
obtain the registration would have a material adverse effect on our business. See “Regulation—Key Regulations
_Affecting Our DACH Division—Regulation under the German Legal Services Regime.”_

_Regulations affecting the Northern European Division_

The Northern European Division is subject to regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates,
including laws and regulations regarding data protection, debt collection, debt purchasing, consumer credits,
payment services, enhanced consumer protection and anti-money laundering and terrorist financing at the national
and supranational level. See “Regulation—Key Regulations Affecting the Northern European Division.” As the
Northern European Division increases its focus on certain business areas, such as offering credit rescheduling
agreements (instalment plans), it may become subject to additional regulatory requirements, including with
respect to anti-money laundering and verifying ownership of underlying assets. There can be no assurances that
its policies and procedures will prevent breaches of applicable laws and regulations or that its investigations will
identify such breaches in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could have a material adverse effect
on its business, results of operations or financial condition. Adverse regulatory developments under the laws and
regulations to which it is subject could expose it to a number of risks. In addition, from time to time the Northern
European Division identifies weaknesses in its internal policies, procedures and controls. The Northern European
Division cannot assure you that in the future it will identify such weaknesses or, where it does, remedy any such
weaknesses in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could have a material adverse effect on its
business, results of operations or financial condition.

In a number of the markets in which the Northern European Division operates, including, in particular
Norway, the regulation of other financial undertakings is in all material respects similar to the rules applicable for
banks (including in respect of capital adequacy requirements). As a consequence, these financial undertakings
may be subject to amended interpretations or decisions by supervisory authorities or new or amended legislation
from the EU applicable to banks, including new or amended capital requirements and liquidity requirements. Such
new or amended legislation and/or amended interpretation could, under certain circumstances, have a material
adverse effect on the Northern European Division’s business, results of operations or financial conditions.

Supervisory authorities in each country in which the Northern European Division operates may
determine that it does not fully comply with, is in violation of, or in the past has violated applicable rules,
regulations or administrative guidelines. If its policies and procedures are deemed not to be in compliance, or are


-----

deemed not to have previously been in compliance, with relevant legal requirements or applicable laws,
regulations or administrative guidelines, this could have a material adverse effect on the Northern European
Division’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

Licensing requirements for debt collection services differ from market to market. Many markets have a
licensing requirement and supervision of compliance. In December 2016, the European Court of Justice (Third
Chamber) ruled that a debt collection agency which concludes, on behalf of a lender, a rescheduling agreement
for an unpaid credit, but which acts as a credit intermediary only in an ancillary capacity, must be regarded as
being a credit intermediary and is not subject to the obligation to provide the consumer with pre-contractual
information. Following the ruling, some countries in the EU have required debt collection companies that offer
instalment plans to hold a consumer credit license so as to be bound by the relevant EU directive. Such license
requirements have already been imposed in a few countries. Although large incumbent credit management
providers, such as us, tend to be better placed to comply with a high regulatory burden, stricter regulations in
general may increase our compliance burden and operating costs. Any temporary or permanent revocation of our
debt collection licenses by the licensing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Some of the countries in which we
operate have also implemented regulations providing limitations on costs for debt collection and duties of
disclosure to consumer customers and such limitations on costs may come under increased regulatory focus by
national governments.

The credit management industry could be subject to increased scrutiny due to local political factors and
developments, which could lead to changes in laws and regulations. The area of consumer credit has recently
come under increased regulatory focus by national governments.

For example, in October 2018 the Norwegian Ministry of Justice appointed a committee to review the
DCA (the “DCA Committee”), including fee structures set forth therein. The DCA Committee is composed of
representatives from the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, financial supervisory authorities, the consumer protection
council, the banking and finance industry and from the debt collection industry. The DCA Committee presented
their report on January 27, 2020 for consideration by the Norwegian Ministry of Justice. The DCA Committee’s
proposal would reduce the amount of collection fees that may be charged on a sliding scale depending on the size
of the overall claim, with the most significant reduction for smaller claims. The proposal has not yet been enacted.
If enacted as proposed, we believe this will have a significant negative impact on the collections, results of
operations and profitability of our Norwegian operations.

Although the review of the 1988 debt collection legislation remains ongoing, the COVID-19 pandemic has
accelerated changes to fee regulations. In response to the pandemic, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice issued an
extraordinary public consultation and on June 19, 2020 approved a measure to reduce collection fees by up to
50% on claims falling due after October 1, 2020. The June 2020 fee reductions are expected to remain in effect
until the ongoing review of the 1988 debt collection legislation is complete. Other elements of the review will
continue to be considered as part of the legislative process. The June 2020 fee reductions will negatively impact
collections, results of operations and profitability of our Norwegian operations.

_Laws and Regulations affecting our Processing of Personal Data_

We handle and process large amounts of consumer personal data, such as names, account numbers,
contact information and other account specific data. Our ability to obtain, retain, share and otherwise process this
data is governed by data protection laws, privacy requirements and other regulatory restrictions, including the
General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)), the German Federal Data Protection
Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, as amended (collectively, the “Data
**Protection Laws”).**

Under GDPR, personal data must be processed fairly, lawfully and transparently. Personal data may only
be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and may only be processed in a manner consistent
with these purposes. Personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the
purposes for which it is collected and/or processed, and it must not be kept in a form that permits identification of
consumers for longer than is necessary for those purposes. Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary,
kept up-to-date. Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures the appropriate security of that personal
data. Personal data must be processed in an accountable manner, i.e., so that compliance can be demonstrated.

The Data Protection Laws require compliance with a series of stringent requirements regarding the
processing of personal data. These include obligations to put in place detailed disclosures to inform customers


-----

about how we may use their personal data, implement robust controls regarding security and access to data and
ensure our customers have rights to access, control and delete their personal data. In addition, there are mandatory
data breach notification requirements to the supervisory authority and in some instances, to the data subjects
themselves.

Furthermore, there are currently a number of additional proposals related to data privacy or security
pending before legislative and regulatory bodies, any of which may require us to further modify our practices and
policies. For example, the European ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC, as amended by Directive
2009/136/EC), which obliges EU member states to introduce certain national laws regulating privacy in the
electronic communications sector, will soon be replaced by the EU “ePrivacy Regulation.” While the text of the
ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, recent European supervisory authorities (Germany, UK and
France) have published guidance in the area of advertising, real-time bidding and cookies. In addition, European
court decisions and court decisions in EU member states (for example, the recent CJEU decision on cookies in
the Planet49 case (Germany)) as well as regulatory guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and
tracking technologies.

As various supervisory authorities start to enforce the strict approach taken in their recent guidance, this
could require us to incur substantial costs to bring our current operations and policies into compliance with the
varying strategies in different markets, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of marketing
activities, adversely affect margins and subject companies to additional liabilities. Regulation of cookies and
similar technologies may lead to broader restrictions on marketing activities and could increase regulatory scrutiny
and potential civil liability under data protection or consumer protection laws. Despite Brexit, the UK ICO has
published its own guidance in the area of cookies, analytics, advertising and real time bidding which is largely
consistent with the guidance issued by supervisory authorities in EU member states such as France, Spain and
Germany. However, there are also jurisdictional differences that will make it more difficult to employ a common
set of policies and marketing strategies for companies that market products throughout Europe.

On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice announced its judgment in case C-311/18 (the “Schrems
**II case”) concerning the permissibility of transferring personal data from parties established within the EU to so-**
called “third countries” (countries outside the EU). The decision means that the certification that companies have
previously been able to rely on when transferring personal data to the United States, the so-called “Privacy Shield”
was declared void with immediate effect. Furthermore, the ruling also sets out further requirements on the use of
EU standard contractual clauses for transfers of data to countries outside the EU, including the United States. The
data exporter and the data importer must assess in detail and on a case-by-case basis whether these clauses are
sufficient safeguards and if not the case implement additional safeguards. With regard to the standard contractual
clauses, it is still uncertain to what extent different types of security measures and procedures will be required to
comply with GDPR after the ruling. The court decision and further guidance from local data protection authorities
in this respect could make it more difficult for us to transfer data to the United States or other third countries in
which we operate

If this is not possible, then supplementary measures are required or the data transfer must be halted. The
European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has yet to define what supplementary measures might entail. The
Information Commissioners Office in the UK has advised that UK organizations need to take stock of international
data transfers and update practices as more guidance is given.

With regard to personal data regulation in the UK, following the end of the Transition Period (the
transition period following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, currently set to expire at 11:00 p.m. (GMT) on
December 31, 2020), we will have to comply with both the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act, as amended.
The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear,
e.g. how data transfers between EU member states and the UK will be treated and whether the Information
Commissioner’s Office can continue to act as a lead supervisory authority. Changes in regard to the UK’s data
protection relationship with the EU may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk profile.

In addition to the risk of regulatory fines imposed under Data Protection Laws, infringement of these
laws can lead to reputational risk and significantly undermine customers’ trust in the organization. We further
note that the UK FCA is particularly focused on operational resilience and has taken action, including the
imposition of significant financial penalties, against regulated firms which have suffered incidents leading to the
loss, disclosure or mishandling of customer data.

We rely on our decision science systems to record and process significant amounts of data quickly and
accurately for our debt collection activities and for our analysis of potential debt purchases. Our ability to conduct


-----

our business, including our ability to price the purchase of portfolios, trace consumers and develop tailored
repayment plans, depends on our ability to use the consumer data we collect for these purposes.

We could lose a significant competitive advantage and our business could be negatively affected, if:

    - any of the information or consumer data that we use were to become public;

    - a change in legislation, client requirements or a change in a regulator’s interpretation of the current
data protection legislation were to prohibit us from using consumer data in the manner or to the
extent which it is currently used;

    - a government or regulator introduced measures that had the effect of facilitating the tracing of
consumers; or

    - the current data processing restrictions changes so that credit market participants could access
credit information before the purchase of portfolios.

The “Data Protection by Design and by Default” concept has required a reappraisal of our IT and
Business Change and Procurement approaches to integrate data protection into our processes, practices and
systems from the design stage through the lifecycle. This includes carrying out data protection impact assessments,
ensuring that data minimization is embedded across the business so that only the appropriate amount of data
required for any particular purpose is processed, deleting unnecessary data and anonymizing data wherever
possible.

Our GDPR program identified risks and associated mitigation plans and we adopted a risk based
approach to their prioritization. A privacy operating model has been defined with clear roles and responsibilities
and is in the process of being embedded in all regions. Further automation and system change is planned via other
strategic programs, which will continue to mature our capability and privacy management framework to
strengthen compliance with Data Protection Laws.

GDPR requires us to maintain technical and organizational security measures in respect of all personal
data we process. Under the GDPR, we are required to notify the applicable supervisory authorities (and where the
breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the applicable data subjects)
should we commit a personal data breach. Certain of our contracts with clients also impose additional obligations
in the event of a personal data breach. Clients may have the contractual right to seek indemnity from us in respect
of such breaches in certain instances. They may also consider removing their business from us. Our revenue
related to such business, along with our reputation, and consequently, our ability to win future business may be
adversely affected in those circumstances.

GDPR imposes certain direct obligations on data processors (which are entities processing personal data
on behalf of the controller) and requires contractual obligations to be implemented between all data controllers
(which are entities determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data) and processors. Thus,
as a controller, we must have specific instructions and agreements with our services providers (processors) about
how they handle personal data and, as a processor, we must follow the instructions of any controllers which share
data with us. As a controller we are fully liable for data processing performed by our processors.

Unfavorable decisions or judgments based on an infringement of the GDPR may result in sanctions and
the payment of regulatory up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual group turnover. After Brexit,
we will face the potential for double regulatory fines in both the UK and the EU. In addition to data protection
sanctions from a supervisory authority, other regulators may impose sanctions or fines as a result of such actions;

GDPR provides a private right of action for material or non-material damage caused by processing that infringes
the GDPR, thus there is a possibility of civil actions brought by data subjects. Any claims or challenges
regarding our data handling practices would also likely attract

    - increased costs for insurance and indemnity cover due to cyber threats and significant expenses of
data breach investigation, remediation and notification;

    - increased requirements in type and level of personnel including IT, marketing and regulatory
compliance professional as well as training; and

    - negative media publicity and reputational damage.


-----

In Germany, on May 25, 2018, the new Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018)
entered into force together with the GDPR. Although a national data protection law still exists in Germany, the
GDPR standardizes the data protection principles in Germany, such regime having, inter alia, the ability to fine
up to the greater of €20 million and 4% of global turnover. In addition, depending on the nature of the infringed
provision, non-compliance with Data Protection Laws may also lead to civil liabilities and criminal sanctions or
fines under the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018). Specific provisions in the Federal
Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018) regulate the legitimacy of credit reporting and scoring as
well as transparency requirements for such types of data processing. It may only be used if data protection rules
are met, if relevant data are used and if the score is based on acknowledged, reliable mathematical-statistical
methods. If address data are used the law requires a prior notice to the data subject. The use of a probability value
calculated by credit reporting agencies to determine a natural person’s ability and willingness to pay is subject to
further requirements stipulated in the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018). See
“Regulation—Key Regulations Affecting Our DACH Division—Data Protection in Germany and in Austria.”

Compliance with this extensive and evolving regulatory framework is expensive and labor intensive.
Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules could result in investigations and enforcement
actions, criminal charges, compensation claims, permissions that we need to do business not being authorized or
being revoked, fines or the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct collections.

In addition, such failure to comply or revocation of a permission, or other actions by us that may damage
the reputation of the originator would entitle our clients to terminate their forward flow agreements or repurchase
portfolios we have previously purchased from them. It would also entitle a creditor that had placed accounts with
us for collection to terminate the servicing contract and remove the accounts from us. Any of these developments
could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct business or on our financial condition, our
financial returns or our results of operations.

**_Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other similar_**
**_outbreaks._**

As a result of COVID-19 or other similar outbreaks or adverse public health developments, particularly
in Europe and the United Kingdom, our operations may experience delays or disruptions, such as the temporary
suspension of operations at one or more of our operating facilities. In addition, our financial condition and results
of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19 or any other epidemic or outbreak harms
the international economy in general. Furthermore, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the population
could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many
countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect our operating results.

The extent to which COVID-19 will impact us remains uncertain due to numerous evolving factors that
we are unable to predict. Although COVID-19 has not had a negative material impact on our operational
capabilities to date and although we believe that in the near- to medium-term it will create opportunities for debt
portfolio purchases, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on our Group collections year to date and could
have further material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition if:

  - the duration and scope of the pandemic result in sustained deterioration in the economic or inflationary
environment in our regions;

  - political, legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic, such as governmental
actions or proposed actions limiting debt collections efforts and encouraging or requiring extensions,
modifications or forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees, prevent us from performing our
collection activities, result in material increases in our costs to comply with such laws and regulations or
result in fewer NPL debt portfolios coming to market;

  - disruptions to the court system and legal process that hinder our ability to collect through the litigation
process are prolonged;

  - consumers respond to COVID-19 by failing to pay amounts owed on receivables owned or managed by
us as a result of their unemployment or other factors that impact their ability to make payments;

  - we are unable to maintain staffing at the levels necessary to operate our business due to extended
lockdowns, governmental actions that result in our business operations being deemed non-essential or


-----

continued spread or increased virulence of COVID-19 causing employees to be unable or unwilling to
work;

  - we are unable to collect on existing owned debt portfolios or experience material decreases in our
collections;

  - we are unable to purchase debt portfolios needed to operate our business because debt owners become
unable or unwilling to sell their NPL debt portfolios consistent with recent levels;

  - reductions in consumer spending could cause a decline in aggregate debt levels and limit our ability to
purchase debt portfolios;

  - adverse capital and credit market conditions increase our cost of capital or affect our ability to meet
liquidity needs;

  - we are required to increase spending on business continuity efforts and readiness efforts for returning to
our offices, which may in turn require that we cut costs and investments in other areas; and/or

  - we suffer a cyber-incident or data or other regulatory breach as a result of increased vulnerability or
weakened controls while a larger number of our employees work remotely.

Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. See “—We are subject to EU, UK, German and Norwegian regulations, among others, and changes
_to the regulatory environment or a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, authorizations, licenses_
_and codes of practice may negatively affect our business,” “—Changes in the economic environment, in particular_
_in the countries in which we operate, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, financial_
_returns and results of operations,” “—We may not be able to successfully maintain and develop our IT_
_infrastructure platform or decision science systems, anticipate, manage or adopt technological advances within_
_our industry or prevent a breach or disruption of the security of our IT infrastructure platform and decision_
_science systems” and “—Improper disclosure of our clients’ sensitive data, consumer data or a breach of Data_
_Protection Laws could negatively affect our business or reputation.”_

To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect general economic conditions or our business,
operations, financial condition or operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described
in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate
sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and potential decreases in our ability to purchase debt portfolios
that are appropriately priced and of a sufficient quality.

In addition, changes to the insolvency laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate in
response to the pandemic may make it more difficult for holders of the Notes to pursue legal actions against us;
for example:

  - On March 27, 2020, Germany adopted the Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for
Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19
Pandemic (as amended), which, _inter alia, provides for a suspension of the obligation to file for_
insolvency due to over-indebtedness until December 31, 2020 unless the insolvency is not caused by the
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This and other limitations set forth therein could make it more
difficult for holders of the Notes to pursue legal actions against our German subsidiaries (see "Certain
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany—Insolvency ”);_

  - Norway recently adopted the Norwegian Temporary Act on Reorganization to Mitigate Economic
Hardship Resulting from COVID-19, which provides certain limitations for creditors to file for
insolvency and to enforce their security (see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Norway—_
_Insolvency”);_

  - The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 came into force in England on June 26, 2020. The
legislation introduces both permanent and temporary reforms to the English insolvency regime, including
temporary restrictions on certain types of enforcement action in respect of unpaid debts (see “Certain
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain_


-----

_Insolvency Law Considerations—England and Wales—Recent Reforms to the English Insolvency_
_Regime”); and_

  - The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has taken a number of exceptional measures in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, including a suspension of certain procedural deadlines applicable in civil and
commercial matters. This suspension of deadlines applies to the one month procedural time-limit for the
insolvency filing obligation provided by article 440 of the Luxembourg commercial code. In principle,
such a suspension of delays should (i) not prevent directors / managers of a Luxembourg company from
filing for bankruptcy upon their own motion (if the conditions thereof are met) and (ii) not restrict the
rights of creditors to petition for bankruptcy of a Luxembourg company. Based on the current legislation,
suspension of delays to file for bankruptcy within one month should remain in place until the end of 2020
(see "Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Luxembourg”)._

**_A decrease in our ability to purchase debt portfolios or an insufficient supply of debt, appropriately priced debt_**
**_or debt of a sufficient quality could materially and adversely affect our business._**

We derived 70% and 68% of our total income from our debt purchase business for each of the year ended
December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Our debt purchase business represented 82% of
our Group cash income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 83% for the twelve months ended June 30,
2020. The availability of debt portfolios for sale at profit-generating prices depends on a number of factors, some
of which are outside of our control, including:

    - regulation of the consumer credit lending industry;

    - lenders changing credit origination strategies;

    - lenders tightening lending criteria;

    - the level of non-performance on consumer debt portfolios and the proportion of such portfolios
that are written off by debt originators, which also in turn may affect the availability of credit to
consumers identified above;

    - sales of debt portfolios by debt originators, which could be impacted by a change in accounting
policies or practices, the consolidation of creditors or increased sophistication in internal collection
efforts;

    - concerns that potential reputational risks or required management attention outweigh the return
associated with selling defaulted debt portfolios;

    - negative publicity or a loss of trust in the CMS industry, whether due to our failure or that of one
or more of our competitors to meet applicable legal or regulatory obligations or otherwise;

    - increased government regulation of the circumstances in which debt originators have a right to
collect on debt; and the macroeconomic environment in the countries in which we operate, or to
the extent that they may impact consumers or the domestic economy in such countries,
macroeconomic conditions and other relevant global or European developments;

    - an increase in demand for debt portfolios among competitors could result in our not being chosen
to purchase a debt portfolio due to more attractive offers from competitors.

Furthermore originators may make a strategic choice to perform more of their own collections in-house
or to rely more heavily on DCAs for initial collection efforts, there could be a reduction in the availability of debt
that is sold early in the cycle and which has had little or no collection activity. For further discussion, see “—We
_depend on the continued willingness and ability of our clients to outsource their debt collection and offer their_
_portfolios for sale.”_

There can be no assurances that we will continue to be able to identify a sufficient volume of portfolios
at appropriate prices. If the volume of debt sales or the quality of debt sold decreases, or the competition for
purchasing such debt portfolios increases, we may not be able to buy the type and quantity of receivables at prices
consistent with our historic return targets. Generally, prices vary significantly among industries. If we are unable


-----

to identify portfolios at appropriate prices or that are of sufficient quality, we may need to purchase portfolios at
higher prices, reducing our level of profit, or identify portfolios of asset types or in industries in which we have
little or no experience, or where it is more difficult to collect on overdue receivables. Purchases in these asset
types or industries may impair our ability to collect on these claims and may cause us to overpay for these claims.
Consequently, we may not be able to meet our historical profit targets in respect of, or make any profit at all, from
these debt purchases.

The supply of debt portfolios available for purchase varies over time. This inconsistency in the
availability of portfolios for purchase may mean that during certain financial reporting periods we may make few
or no debt purchases. This could adversely affect our reported results. In addition, if any originators with which
we have committed to purchase debt portfolios should fail to complete such sales, we may be unable to make such
committed portfolio purchases. If we do not continually replace the debt portfolios we service with additional
portfolios, our business could be materially and adversely affected. For further discussion of these risks, see “—
_We depend on the continued willingness and ability of our clients to outsource their debt collection and offer their_
_portfolios for sale.”_

If we are unable to identify sufficient levels of attractive portfolios and generate an appropriate return on
purchased debt, we may experience difficulties covering the related expenses and may, as a consequence, need to
reduce the number of our collection personnel or take other measures to reduce costs. These developments could
lead to disruptions in our operations, loss of efficiency, decreased employee morale, fewer experienced employees
and excess costs associated with unused space in our facilities and, as a result, a further loss of clients. Any of
these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Failure to renew existing debt collection contracts on similar terms or at all, win new debt collection contracts,_**
**_replace terminated forward flow agreements or successfully manage our commitments under forward flow_**
**_agreements may adversely affect our revenue._**

We obtain most of our debt collection contracts through a competitive bidding process, and, apart from
forward flow agreements that we renew on a bilateral basis, substantially all of the debt collection contracts that
we expect to seek in the foreseeable future likely will be subject to a competitive bidding process. We may be
required to compete to renew existing debt collection contracts that have in the past been awarded to us without
competition from competitors or for which we have been the incumbent provider of debt collection services for a
long time. We may also enter into debt collection contracts at price levels or with margins that are lower than we
find acceptable, if we want to develop a new relationship with an originator or get a foothold in new industries or
if the overall competition for debt portfolios increases. We may not be afforded the opportunity in the future to
bid on debt collection contracts that are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire if the existing contract
is extended. In addition, we cannot be certain that all our existing clients will choose to continue to use our debt
collection services for the same volumes of debt or at all in the future. Our inability to renew contracts with
existing clients on similar terms or at all or to find suitable replacements could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

From our UK Division’s Start Date (June 1, 2004) to June 30, 2020, 43% of our UK Division’s portfolio
purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements or agreements that were a mixture of a forward flow
agreement with a spot purchase, representing £845.8 million in portfolio purchases. From our DACH Division’s
Start Date (September 30, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 48% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward
flow agreements, representing €320.1 million in portfolio purchases. From our Northern European Division’s
Start Date (January 1, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 31% of portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow
agreements or agreements that were a mixture of a forward flow agreement with a spot purchase, representing
€361.4 million in portfolio purchases. A forward flow agreement is an arrangement in which we agree to purchase
claims based on specific parameters from a third-party supplier on a periodic basis at a set price over a specified
time period. Although our fixed term forward flow agreements mainly include provisions for automatic renewal
if none of the parties expressly terminates the agreement, a number of our forward flow agreements may expire
in 2020, 2021 and 2022. We could lose a potential source of income if we are unable to renew or replace any
volume represented by our forward flow agreements upon termination or expiration. Although we expect that
many of these will be renewed, our current forward flow agreements provide no medium to long-term assurance
on purchasing levels.


-----

**_We are dependent on clients in a variety of industries and failure to maintain relationships with these clients_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations._**

A significant portion of the Group’s income is generated from a limited number of industries. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Group’s 3PC income was £158.7 million, split between financial services
(48.6%), retail (10.3%), utilities (5.0%) and other (36.1%).

A significant decrease in the amount of debt collection outsourced or the volume of debt available for
purchase on acceptable terms from any of our principal clients in these sectors would force us to seek alternative
sources of revenue. Clients may elect to change CMS providers if the providers’ reputation is harmed by external
factors. In addition, our clients may change CMS providers based on a change of control. See “—Limitations
_imposed on us by debt originators of debt portfolios may adversely impact our operational flexibility.” We may_
be unable to find alternative sources of revenue and, even if replacement clients could be found, the search could
take time or the debt could be of lower quality and/or higher cost. See “—A decrease in our ability to purchase
_debt portfolios or an insufficient supply of debt, appropriately priced debt or debt of a sufficient quality could_
_materially and adversely affect our business.” Any material failure in the insurance, telecommunications, retail_
or financial services sectors or any significant change in the willingness or ability of debt originators in these
sectors to outsource or sell their debt to debt collection agencies, such as changes in applicable law or regulations
relating to these industries that restrict or prohibit such actions, could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We depend on the continued willingness and ability of our clients to outsource their debt collection and offer_**
**_their portfolios for sale._**

We depend on the willingness and ability of our clients to continually engage us to provide CMS. Some
factors that may influence our clients’ willingness and ability to engage us to provide CMS include, but are not
limited to, the strength of our reputation, regulatory pressures our clients face and the value proposition that we
offer. Debt originators may develop technological tools similar to ours, such as sophisticated decision science and
consumer profile development that could increase their competitive advantages. If debt originators choose to
perform more of their debt collections internally as a result of these data quality improvements, the volume of
debt portfolios available for purchase could decrease and the quality of debt portfolios that are sold could suffer.
This could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—A
_decrease in our ability to purchase debt portfolios or an insufficient supply of debt, appropriately priced debt or_
_debt of a sufficient quality could materially and adversely affect our business.”_

Our business would be adversely affected if our clients decide to reduce or discontinue the outsourcing
of their debt collection or portfolio sales or if the actual growth of levels of outsourcing and sales is lower than
expected. In addition, our future revenue growth may be limited if companies that do not currently outsource their
debt collection or sell portfolios continue to manage their portfolios in-house. There can be no assurances that the
demand for our services will increase or remain the same, and a decrease or stagnation in demand for our services,
or if one or more material debt originators stop or decrease their portfolio sales due to one of the factors listed
above or any other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_We generate a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of large clients and we are dependent_**
**_on a small number of key suppliers._**

Although the relative significance of individual clients changes from year to year, a significant
percentage of our revenue is generated by contracts with a small number of clients in any given year. For example,
in our DACH Division, in the year ended December 31, 2019, 82% of our portfolio purchases came from 10
vendors. In our UK Division, in the year ended December 31, 2019, 58% of our portfolio purchases came from
five vendors. In our Northern European Division, in the year ended December 31, 2019, 75% of our portfolio
purchases came from 10 vendors. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our DACH Division’s top five thirdparty collections clients generated 18% of our DACH Division’s total income (excluding lawyer service revenue
and other service revenue), and 40% of our DACH Division’s third-party collection income (excluding lawyer
service revenue and other service revenue). Our DACH Division’s top five debt purchase vendors by income
represented 21%, 8%, 8%, 5% and 4% of our DACH Division’s debt purchase income, respectively for the same
period. Our top five DACH Division third-party collections clients represented 8%, 4%, 2%, 2% and 2% of our
DACH Division’s total income (excluding lawyer service revenue and other service revenue), respectively. Our
UK Division’s top five debt purchase vendors by income represented 19%, 9%, 7%, 7% and 7% of our UK
Division’s debt purchase income, respectively, for the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our


-----

Northern European Division’s top five third-party collections clients generated 6% of our Northern European
Division’s total income and 17% of our Northern European Division’s third-party collection income. Our
Northern European Division’s top five debt purchase vendors by income represented 15%, 7%, 5%, 3% and 3%
of our Northern European Division’s total debt purchase income, respectively, for the year ended December 31,
2019.

A creditor’s decision to sell debt to us or contract with us for third-party collection services is based on
price, reputation, compliance history and other factors. We cannot be certain that we will maintain our
relationships with our current and/or future debt originator clients including large clients that make material
contributions to our revenue. These clients may cease to offer us desirable terms or debt in acceptable quantities,
or they may become insolvent or cease to exist. For example, our DACH Division lost one of the top 10 originators
in its third-party collection services business in 2019 in a formal and competitive tender, mainly due to higher
recovery rates offered by competitors that we believe are unrealistic. Furthermore, many of our contracts with our
clients do not have a fixed term or renew automatically and, therefore, may be terminated on relatively short notice
in certain circumstances. Any changes to the key relationships that we rely on could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

A significant decrease in the volume of debt portfolio purchases available from any of the debt originators
with which we are currently working, on terms acceptable to us, would make it necessary to further enlarge our
network of sellers or the sources of debt to purchase. Furthermore, because reputation is paramount in our industry,
the loss of a key vendor relationship could jeopardize our existing relationship with other vendors or our ability
to establish new relationships with other vendors. We may be unable to find alternative sources from which to
purchase debt, and even if we could successfully replace such purchases, the search could take time, and the
receivables could be of lower quality or higher cost, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.
See “—A decrease in our ability to purchase debt portfolios or an insufficient supply of debt, appropriately priced
_debt or debt of a sufficient quality could materially and adversely affect our business.”_

In addition, we face supply risks, including certain single-source supply risks. In particular, our UK
Division relies on a single supplier for a substantial amount of its consumer credit data (for further discussion of
this risk, see “—We are highly dependent on our intelligence systems and proprietary consumer profiles”), and
our DACH Division relies heavily upon one supplier for certain software solutions. If any of these suppliers were
to significantly limit access to their services, significantly raise their prices, experience labor disputes and work
stoppages, become insolvent or cease to exist, this could impede our ability to collect on claims or increase our
collections costs and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_We are active in competitive markets and may be unable to continue to successfully compete with businesses_**
**_that may offer more attractive prices or have greater financial resources, less expensive funding or lower return_**
**_requirements than we have._**

We face competition from new and existing purchasers of debt portfolios and debt collection providers
in the markets in which we operate.

_Competition in the UK market_

We face competition in the UK from new and existing purchasers of debt portfolios, and large and
established foreign debt purchasers are active in the UK debt purchase market. In addition, the UK debt purchase
market has recently experienced significant capital inflows. Furthermore, average portfolio purchase prices in the
UK debt purchase market are expected to increase over the coming years due to: (i) improvements in collection
efficiencies; (ii) sustained competition for the purchase of portfolios; and (iii) greater proportions of the portfolios
sold containing fresher debt, with a higher proportion of paying accounts. We may also face competition in this
market from financial investors (i.e., those more suited to the purchase of a portfolio consisting of largely paying
accounts, such as institutional investors). Moreover, such competition, also driven by greater financial resources,
less expensive funding or lower return requirements, may lead to an increase in the purchase price demanded by
debt originators for their debt portfolios, which we may not be willing or able to offer.

Our UK business mainly focuses on the purchase of debt portfolios. Some of our competitors have more
significant UK DCA businesses in addition to operations involving the purchase of debt portfolios. These
competitors may be able to offer originators a more attractive suite of services, or they may be able to use the
consumer data provided at the DCA stage to help them price debt portfolios more accurately, or collect debt
receivables more effectively or efficiently, than we can.


-----

There can be no assurance that we will be able to offer competitive bids for debt portfolios, or that we
will be able to maintain the advantages in tracing technology, consumer profile development, or low servicing
costs that we believe that we currently possess in the UK market. If we are unable to develop and expand our
business or adapt to changing market needs as well as our current or future competitors are able to do, or if our
competitors are able to make advances in their pricing or collections methods that we are not able to make, we
may be unable to purchase debt portfolios at prices we deem appropriate in order to operate profitably in the UK.
Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

_Competition in the German market_

The German debt collection market is highly fragmented and consists of numerous companies with
varying profiles. These companies compete with us on, among other things, the basis of price. New entrants to
the German market and existing competitors may offer more attractive pricing levels, both for debt collection
contracts and for debt portfolio purchases, and accept lower returns in order to gain or increase market share.
There can be no assurances that this price competition will not result in us paying higher prices for portfolios that
we purchase or charging less for our debt collection services, both of which could decrease our margins and have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We face bidding competition in our acquisition of debt portfolios in the German market. We believe that
successful bids are awarded based on price and a range of other factors, including service, compliance, reputation
and relationships with the sellers of debt portfolios. Some of our current competitors, and potential new
competitors, in the German market may have more effective pricing and collection models, greater adaptability
to changing market needs and more established relationships in our industry or the business sectors in which we
operate. Moreover, our competitors in the German market may elect to pay prices for debt portfolios that we
determine are not economically sustainable and, in that event, our volume of debt portfolio purchases may
decrease. There can be no assurance either that our existing or potential debt portfolio sources within the German
market will continue to sell their portfolios at recent levels or at all, or that we will continue to make competitive
bids for debt portfolios.

Some of our current competitors, and potential new competitors, in the German market may have
substantially greater financial resources, less expensive funding or lower return requirements than we currently
have. The CMS industry in Germany might further consolidate and our competitors might merge, creating size
and scale benefits that we might not be able to match. In addition, in the future we may not have the financial
resources to make competitive bids for portfolio purchases and debt collection contracts, especially when
competing with competitors that have greater financial resources than we have. Competition is not limited to the
bidding process, as some of our clients will simultaneously retain multiple CMS companies to perform collections
on their behalf, thereby intensifying the competition for ongoing and new business. There can be no assurances
that we will be able to develop and expand our business in Germany or adapt to changing market needs as well as
our current or future competitors. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

_Competition in the Northern European market_

The Northern European CMS industry is fragmented and consists of competitors with varying profiles.
The Northern European Division faces competition from new and existing debt collection providers, other
purchasers of portfolios of overdue debt and other overdue receivables and debt originators that manage their own
portfolios rather than outsourcing or selling them. This competition includes, but is not limited to, competition on
the basis of price. New market entrants and existing competitors may offer more attractive pricing levels, both for
debt collection contracts and for debt portfolio purchases, and accept lower returns in order to gain or increase
market share. There can be no assurances that this price competition will not result in the Northern European
Division paying higher prices for portfolios that it purchases or charging less for its debt collection services, both
of which could decrease its margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

_Competition in other markets_

We also operate in Austria and Switzerland and have minor operations in Croatia. In the future, we may
expand into additional markets. We face significant competition in each of our current markets and expect to face
significant competition in any other market that we may enter into in the future. There can be no assurances that


-----

we will be able to develop and expand our business in these markets or adapt to changing market needs as well as
our current or future competitors.

**_Errors in our collection process or other operational matters could have a negative effect on our business and_**
**_reputation._**

Our ability to collect debt according to the correct contractual terms and to treat consumers fairly is
critical to our business and our reputation. Our reputation is fundamental to maintaining our relationships with
current and potential clients and regulators. The following events, among others, may have a negative effect on
our reputation and/or our financial results: negative media publicity relating either to us or the wider CMS
industry, allegations of unethical or improper behavior by us or third parties we use in the collection process, our
inability to collect debt on an accurate and timely basis, our failure to respect and treat the consumers fairly,
failures in our collection and data protection processes, the actions of third parties engaged by us in the debt
collection process, IT platform failure or other operational issues, litigation, regulatory restrictions, investigations,
fines or enforcement actions and matters affecting our financial reporting.

The collection of debt involves interpretations of contractual terms that may vary by debt originator,
which may impact the calculation of consumers’ resulting payment obligations and the collection strategies we
employ. The inherent complexity of debt calculation and historical inaccuracies may result in our failure to choose
the appropriate collection strategies and could lead to incorrect payment calculations in the future. Furthermore,
under German law, if we agree on a payment plan with a consumer based on an incorrect calculation of the debt,
such payment plan will become binding and may not be renegotiated. Therefore, processing errors may have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Such processing or other operational errors could lead to an increase in new consumer complaints which
could harm our reputation with debt originators, consumers and/or regulatory authorities. Any of the
aforementioned events could thereby result in financial liability for us and could jeopardize our relationships with
the debt originators with which we have already established a business relationship or our ability to establish new
relationships with other debt originators, have a negative impact on a consumer’s willingness to pay a debt owed
to us or to our clients, diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty or lead to increased regulation of the CMS
industry, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition. See “—Negative attention and news regarding the debt purchase and collection industry and individual
_debt purchasers and collectors, including us, may have a negative impact on a consumer’s willingness to pay a_
_debt owed to us and may diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty for debt originators and other third_
_parties,” “—We are subject to EU, UK, German and Norwegian regulations, among others, and changes to the_
_regulatory environment or a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, authorizations, licenses and_
_codes of practice may negatively affect our business” and “—We are subject to audits conducted by sellers of our_
_debt portfolios and clients that place debt with us for collection on a contingent basis, and we may be required to_
_implement specific changes to our policies and practices as a result of adverse findings by such sellers as a part_
_of this audit process, or certain sellers may remove us from their panels of preferred purchasers, which could_
_limit our ability to purchase debt portfolios from them in the future, which could materially and adversely affect_
_our business.”_

**_Negative attention and news regarding the debt purchase and collection industry and individual debt_**
**_purchasers and collectors, including us, may have a negative impact on a consumer’s willingness to pay a debt_**
**_owed to us and may diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty for debt originators and other third parties._**

There are various factors that may cause consumers to be more reluctant to pay their debt in full or at all,
or more willing to pursue legal actions against us (including, in the UK, through complaints to the UK FOS), and,
in Germany, through consumer protection associations (Verbraucherschutzvereine) or other similar third party
agencies and in the other jurisdictions in which we operate), even if such actions are not warranted. These factors
include, inter alia: (i) publications in online, print and broadcast media, from time to time, of stories about the
debt collection or debt purchase industry that may cite specific examples of real or perceived abusive collection
practices as well as regulatory investigations and enforcement actions; (ii) online articles, blogs and tweets that
may lead to the rapid dissemination of a story and increase exposure to negative publicity surrounding the debt
purchase and CMS industry in general or in relation to us or any of our clients in particular; (iii) websites where
consumers list their concerns about the activities of debt collectors and seek online guidance from others on how
to react to collection efforts and (iv) the activities of commission driven claims management companies bringing
complaints about our activity on behalf of individuals or a cohort of customers. These websites are increasingly
providing consumers with letter templates, guidance and other strategies to protest collection efforts and to try to
avoid their obligations. To the extent that these forms and strategies are based upon erroneous legal information,


-----

the cost of collections may increase. Finally, in Germany, consumer blogs and consumer protection associations
(Verbraucherschutzvereine) are becoming more common and add to the negative attention surrounding the CMS
industry.

Negative publicity could also result from us being named in published industry complaint data sites,
receiving negative attention due to internal disputes, failing to prevent potential unlawful behavior of our
employees and engaging in disputes with former employees or being subject to negative publicity relating to any
of our clients or any former employers of our key executives. Negative publicity relating to violations by any of
the third parties we engage, of legal or other regulatory requirements, could also result in negative publicity or
reputational damage to us.

Any such negative publicity could jeopardize our existing relationships with debt originators or our
ability to establish new relationships with other debt originators, diminish our attractiveness as counterparties
generally or lead to requests by the debt originator to reassign debt portfolios. Any of the foregoing could impact
our ability to purchase debt portfolios or our ability to collect debt owed to us or to our clients, and may materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We are subject to risks associated with our contracts and business model for debt collection services, including_**
**_our ability to correctly assess pricing terms and the potential early termination or a reduction in the volume of_**
**_claims we service._**

The profitability of our debt collection services will generally depend upon our ability to successfully
calculate prices by taking into consideration all economic factors and our ability to manage day-to-day operations
under these contracts. Under most of our debt collection contracts we do not get paid unless a consumer begins
paying on a claim and we may be unable to accurately predict the costs or identify the risks associated with these
contracts or the complexity of the services, which may result in lower than expected margins, losses under these
contracts or even the loss of clients. Some of our material contracts for debt collection services subject us to early
termination clauses in a range of circumstances and also include benchmark clauses or, in a small number of
contracts, penalties and /or service credits for the failure of service level agreements. If we are unable to satisfy
the terms of our contracts, then we could potentially have contracts terminated and lose clients and income.

The majority of our material debt collection contracts have an initial stated term, typically one to three
years, and, in some cases, termination clauses permitting the debt originator to cancel the contract at its discretion
following the expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurances that our clients will not exercise
their rights to terminate their contracts prior to expiration or that we will be successful in negotiating new contracts
with clients as such contracts expire. In addition, we are also exposed to unforeseen changes in the scope of
existing contracts, including prices or volumes, that may occur as a result of any changes in the general business
or political landscape of our clients. Generally, our debt collection contracts do not have volume commitments,
and a client can eliminate or reduce the volume of claims it outsources to us for debt collection without formally
terminating the contract. We may have disputes or disagreements with our clients as to the level of services we
have agreed to provide or contract terms. The potential effects of these risks may increase as we enter into larger
contracts. If we are unable to fulfill our obligations under our contracts for any reason, we risk the loss of revenue
and fees under that contract, the potential loss of a client and significant harm to our reputation. Any of our
contracts could become more costly than initially anticipated, and as a result, we may experience significant
increases in our operating costs and/or potential litigation. Furthermore, we may experience delays in integrating
with our existing operations any additional collection platforms that we acquire or the carve-outs of our clients’
in-house collections departments. Accordingly, if we are unable to collect or maximize payments from consumers
through our various initiatives, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any of these
developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to collect the expected amounts on our existing owned debt portfolios or the value of our_**
**_owned debt portfolios may deteriorate, and this may lead to reduced profits, write-downs or lost market_**
**_opportunities._**

As the length of time involved in collecting on our existing owned debt portfolios may be extensive and
since the factors affecting debt collection rates may be volatile and outside our control, we may be unable to
identify economic trends or make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner.

If our diligence for the purchased debt is not sufficiently comprehensive or if the assumptions used by
us in our models are incorrect, including, but not limited to, claims not being time barred, the age and balances of
the purchased claims being correctly stated by the sellers, consumers being alive and the claim not resulting from


-----

fraud, or if some of the accounts in a debt portfolio behave differently from the way we expect, these could result
in a loss of value in a debt portfolio after purchase, subsequent negative revaluations in our statement of financial
position and a continuing deterioration in value over time as actual collections can deviate significantly from the
collection estimates produced by our pricing model as accounts age. We do not have an insurance policy that
covers breaches of guarantees, representations and warranties with respect to the quality of the purchased debt in
our debt purchase agreements. Therefore, we may not be able to pass on the losses in the event that we cannot
take recourse against the seller.

We purchase debt mainly at a discount to face value, except for small amounts of debt purchased through
our DACH Division’s historical PayProtect service, for which we pay the full face value of the debt. The Northern
European Division also provides value-added services which purchase debt at full face value. Debt that we
purchase typically consists of loans that consumers have failed to repay and, in certain cases that the debt
originator has deemed to be uncollectable. It is crucial for our business that we are able to identify debt portfolios
that are of sufficient quality for us to determine what we are likely to collect on the claims. Before making the
decision to sell their overdue or defaulted debt and other overdue receivables, clients usually make various
attempts to recover on such receivables, often using a combination of in-house recovery efforts and third-party
collection agencies. These overdue claims are difficult to collect and we may not collect a sufficient amount to
cover our investment associated with purchasing the debt portfolios of overdue receivables and the costs of
running our business. There can be no assurances that any of the claims contained in our owned debt portfolios
will eventually be collected. Furthermore, most of the debt claims that we own are unsecured and an increase in
bankruptcy filings involving consumers could impact our ability to collect on those claims. If the cash flows from
our existing owned debt portfolios (and the debt portfolios we purchase in the future) are less than anticipated, we
may be unable to purchase all of the new debt portfolios that we would like to purchase, may need to pay a higher
interest rate to finance the purchase of new debt portfolios or may need to accept lower returns. This could also
result in further write-downs of our owned debt portfolios. As a result of further write-downs or any of the
aforementioned factors, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Limitations imposed on us by debt originators of debt portfolios may adversely impact our operational_**
**_flexibility._**

We derived 70% and 68% of our total income from our debt purchase business for each of the year ended
December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Contracts entered into with our clients for the
purchase of debt portfolios typically impose various restrictions on our realization of value from the debt
portfolios, including restrictions on our ability to resell portfolios, even if the legal title to the debt has been
transferred to us. Debt originators from both our third-party collection services and purchased debt businesses
may also restrict our flexibility in pursuing certain enforcement and collection activities. In addition, our clients
may have the right to compel us to undertake or refrain from taking certain actions, including agreeing the fees
that we can pass through to the respective consumers. Furthermore, debt originators may have rights to repurchase
portfolios and require reassignment to protect against factors such as reputational risk. In instances where accounts
are fraud-sensitive or where an accountholder has raised a complaint against the debt originator, among other
things, debt originators may also have rights to repurchase or require reassignment of the respective debt
portfolios. Debt originators may have the right to terminate such agreements upon a direct or indirect change of
control of our company. Any of the foregoing factors may adversely impact the profitability of debt portfolios
that we purchase and our operational flexibility and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to audits conducted by sellers of our debt portfolios and clients that place debt with us for_**
**_collection on a contingent basis, and we may be required to implement specific changes to our policies and_**
**_practices as a result of adverse findings by such sellers as a part of this audit process, or certain sellers may_**
**_remove us from their panels of preferred purchasers, which could limit our ability to purchase debt portfolios_**
**_from them in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business._**

Our companies are subject to audits that are conducted by sellers of our debt portfolios and clients who
place debt with us for contingent collections. In the UK, regulations and contractual provisions require us to
provide our clients with the opportunity to conduct such an audit whereas in Germany and Northern Europe, client
audits are available pursuant to provisions in some of our contractual agreements. In addition, relevant authorities
may perform audits pursuant to the relevant laws and regulations in Germany, in the four countries in the Nordic
region and in the other jurisdictions in which we operate and in connection with such audits, we need to provide
the relevant authorities with information upon their request. Audits may occur with little or no notice and the
assessment criteria used by each seller and creditor varies based on their own requirements, policies and standards.


-----

Although much of the assessment criteria is based on regulatory requirements in the UK, Germany and in Northern
Europe, we may be asked to comply with additional terms and conditions that are unique to particular debt
originators in either the UK, Germany or Northern Europe. From time to time, clients may determine that we are
not in compliance with certain of their criteria and in such cases, we may be required to dedicate resources and to
incur expenses to address such concerns through the implementation of new policies and procedures or by other
means. We may also be subject to audits in the other jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, to the extent
that we are unable to satisfy the requirements of a particular client or where our noncompliance is deemed
sufficiently significant or systemic, such client may remove us from its panel of preferred purchasers or suppliers,
which could limit our ability to purchase debt portfolios from, or service the collection of debt for, such client in
the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, in certain circumstances in the
UK, audit reports may need to be provided to the regulator, and there is also a risk that any non-compliance
identified in those reports may be viewed by the regulator as a breach of our regulatory obligations owed to it.

We may also be subject to audits as determined by the contractual provisions agreed with our financing
and co-investment partners. If we were unable to remedy any material noncompliance identified by any such audit,
this could impact the continuation of the underlying structures.

**_The statistical models and decision science tools that we use in our business may prove to be inaccurate, we_**
**_may not achieve anticipated levels of return and we may be unable to appropriately identify and address_**
**_underperforming portfolios._**

We use internally developed models and other decision science tools extensively in our operations. At
the time of purchase, however, we are likely to have imperfect information about the precise age of the debt, the
ability of the consumer to pay, the time at which the consumer will pay and the cost required to service and collect
on such debt. Therefore, our ERC figures could be inaccurate. Moreover, our performance metrics, such as ERC
and Gross Money Multiples, are forward looking in nature and have inherent limitations as they are based on
historical data and assumptions based on such data, which may prove to be inaccurate. In addition, our historical
information about portfolios may not be indicative of the characteristics of subsequent portfolios purchased from
the same debt originator or within the same industry due to changes in business practices or economic
developments and our internal databases may not be as extensive as needed for a comprehensive decision science.
There is a significant amount of management judgment and estimation involved in purchasing and valuing
portfolios and there can be no assurances that management’s judgments and estimations will prove to be accurate.
Furthermore, although we have review structures in place designed to ensure that portfolios performing
significantly outside of forecast will be reviewed by management, there can be no assurances that we will be able
to appropriately identify and address underperforming portfolios.

In addition, our decision science team may not be able to achieve the desired results and may not be able
to create the decision science functions which we need in order to operate profitably.

Furthermore, if we purchase types of debt portfolios with which we have limited experience or from
clients with which we have no prior dealings, our ability to properly price and collect on such debt portfolios may
be adversely affected. Lack of reliable information, or the use of inaccurate assumptions, can lead to mispricing
of owned debt portfolios, which may have an adverse effect on the financial returns from such portfolios or can
lead us to underbid on and lose bids for debt portfolio purchases. Our statistical models and analysis tools make
use of information provided by third parties, such as credit information suppliers and other mainstream or public
sources, or generated by software products. We have no control over the accuracy or sufficiency of information
received from such third parties. If such information is inaccurate or insufficient, we could incorrectly price
portfolios that we purchase, incorrectly value our existing owned debt portfolios, set debt originator prices or
performance goals inaccurately, and/or experience lesser liquidation rates or greater operating expenses.

There can be no assurances that any of the current or future debt contained in our owned debt portfolios
will eventually be collected. If we are not able to achieve results consistent with our forecasted levels of collection
and underlying cost assumptions, valuation impairments may be recognized, our portfolios may be written down
and revenue and returns on purchases of portfolios may be reduced. Any of the foregoing factors could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our need to adapt to consumers’ changing financial circumstances may result in increased servicing costs,_**
**_reduced cash flow or imprecise modeling._**

We proactively work with consumers who experience a reduced ability to pay their debt to try to reach
an appropriate payment plan through means such as reduced average monthly payments. This adaptability on our


-----

part could lead to increased servicing costs as our employees renew contact with consumers and revise pre-existing
payment arrangements. Furthermore, a reduction in monthly payments would reduce our cash generation and
returns on capital. A change from our original estimates of servicing costs or consumers’ monthly payments may
mean we may not achieve our expected returns. Additionally, our modeling for future pricing decisions may be
rendered less reliable if we are unable to accurately predict the number of consumers who will, or which
consumers will, need to reduce their debt payments or the amounts of such reductions. As a result, our financial
condition, financial returns and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

**_We may experience volatility in our reported financial results due to the revaluation of our owned debt_**
**_portfolios and the timing of portfolio purchases during the financial year._**

Our owned debt portfolios are initially recognized at a carrying value equal to the portfolio’s purchase
price and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Following acquisition, the value of
these assets may be adjusted as the cash flow projections associated with the portfolios are reassessed based upon
actual collections results. For more information, see _“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Description of the Group’s Principal_
_IFRS Statement of Financial Position Items.” Accordingly, the value of our owned debt portfolios as recorded in_
our consolidated financial statements may fluctuate as a result of these reassessments.

There is sometimes a gap between the point in time when we purchase a portfolio and the point in time
when we begin earning returns on the purchased portfolio. This is because we do not always have control over
when a deal to purchase a portfolio will close, and we need to locate consumers, build a consolidated profile of
each such consumer’s circumstances and formulate an appropriate repayment solution before we can start to
collect on a purchased portfolio. As a result, we may experience fluctuating cash flows and delays in generating
income from purchased portfolios. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We use a number of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements,_**
**_which could prove to be incorrect or cause our earnings to fluctuate._**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income
and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other
factors that are considered by management to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time. These estimates
and assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not
readily available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift over time, based on
changes in accounting policies, accounting standards or our business profile.

Complex judgments are required in relation to revenue recognition, impairment of our purchased loan
portfolios, collection forecast and impairment tests of our goodwill, among others. For example, the estimates
used to calculate our returns on our owned debt portfolios are primarily based on historical cash collection
experience and payer dynamics. If future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing, our
earnings could be affected, either positively or negatively. Higher collection amounts or cash collections that
occur sooner than projected will have a favorable impact on revenue in the form of income increases or impairment
reversals. In addition, higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected could have
the effect of reducing the expected future value of our loan portfolios, requiring us to purchase additional loan
portfolios in order to maintain our level of expected future cash flows, which we might not be able to do. Lower
collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected will have an adverse impact and may result
in an impairment of the purchased loan portfolio. Impairments, in turn, cause reduced and fluctuating earnings. In
the future, should actual results differ from management’s estimates and assumptions (particularly with respect to
revenue recognition and collection forecast) this could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
results of operations and financial condition. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Our Foreign_
_Exchange Rate Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Market Risk and Credit Risk—Significant Accounting Issues.”_

**_It can take several years to realize cash returns on our investments in owned debt portfolios, during which time_**
**_we are exposed to a number of risks in our business._**

We generally measure our investments based on a projected return, typically up to 120 months, based on
the historical data and collection forecast for our UK Division and DACH Division. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of our Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of the_


-----

_Operations.” We estimate that it will take an average of 34 months for our 2019 owned debt portfolio acquisitions_
to collect the gross cash cost of each of the owned debt portfolio, and, in some cases, it may take significantly
longer than average to realize cash returns equal to this initial investment. During this period, significant changes
may occur in the economy, the regulatory environment, our business or our markets, which could lead to a
reduction in our expected returns or forecasted collection plan, a reduction of which could cause us to record an
impairment of our owned debt portfolios, or reduce the value of the debt portfolios that we have purchased. Given
the multi-year payback period on substantially all our purchases, each portfolio purchase exposes us to the risk of
such changes for a significant period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.

**_Our forward flow agreements may contractually require us to purchase portfolios at unfavorable or_**
**_uneconomic prices._**

From our UK Division’s Start Date (June 1, 2004) to June 30, 2020, 43% of its portfolio purchases were
made pursuant to forward flow agreements or agreements that were a mixture of a forward flow agreement with
a spot purchase, representing £845.8 million in portfolio purchases. From our DACH Division’s Start Date
(September 30, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 48% of its portfolio purchases were made under forward flow agreements,
representing €320.1 million in portfolio purchases. From our Northern European Division’s Start Date (January
1, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 31% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements or
agreements that were a mixture of a forward flow agreement with a spot purchase, representing €361.4 million in
portfolio purchases. Commitments under such forward flow contracts are typically for approximately one to three
years, although in the UK, we have entered into five year forward flow agreements with two creditors. However,
depending upon the length of the contractual arrangements, forward flow agreements generally contain
termination clauses that allow the arrangement to be terminated early and on relatively short notice in certain
circumstances, such as where there is a change of control or at will for certain of our clients. We may be required
to purchase debt under a forward flow agreement for an amount greater than we would have otherwise agreed to
pay at the time of purchase due to pressure from larger clients or major debt portfolio sellers, which could result
in reduced returns. In addition, we could be faced with a choice between decreasing our purchasing volume,
agreeing to forward flow agreements at a higher average price or agreeing to fewer contractual protections
concerning the portfolios we purchase, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. We generally allow for some margin for future fluctuations in value of the debt we purchase through
forward flow agreements, but future fluctuations in value may exceed that margin due to circumstances beyond
our control, such as economic conditions or other market conditions. If the quality of debt purchased varies from
our pricing assumptions, we may price the contract improperly, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to procure sufficient funding on favorable terms to purchase further debt portfolios as they_**
**_become available._**

Historically, we have funded purchases of portfolios through cash generated by our operations,
borrowings and loans procured by our relevant majority shareholders. Our ability to obtain funding in the future
from these sources will depend on our performance and prospects, as well as other factors beyond our control.
Such factors may include weak economic and capital market conditions during or prior to periods in which
attractive debt portfolios are available for purchase, the ability and willingness of banks and other clients to lend
to our industry generally or to us, in particular, and changes in fiscal, monetary and other government policies,
among others. We believe that the combined operating cash flows of the Group, together with the cash resources
and future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our debt and tax servicing
requirements as they become due, working capital requirements and anticipated debt purchases, although this may
not be the case. In particular, future drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will only be available if, among
other things, we meet the financial covenants included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” An inability to procure
sufficient funding at favorable terms to purchase portfolios as they become available could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We could be adversely affected if third parties providing services on which we rely, including lawyers or data_**
**_providers, perform poorly, cease to provide services or fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements._**

Our business is dependent on a number of key relationships with third parties as part of the supply chain
to provide our services. For example, when our internal debt collection efforts are unsuccessful, we may engage
law firms, with which we have framework service agreements, to collect or enforce the receivables in our name
or in the name of our clients. Any failure by third parties involved in our supply chain to adequately perform


-----

services for us on an efficient basis for any reason (including insolvency) or to meet agreed service levels could
materially reduce our cash flows, income and profitability, and adversely affect our reputation and results of
operations.

Furthermore, these third parties may not be bound by our industry standards and practices. These third
parties could commit fraud with respect to the consumer accounts that we place with them or fail to comply with
applicable laws and regulations, such as Data Protection Laws, or to provide us with accurate data on the accounts
they are servicing. To the extent that these third parties violate laws, other regulatory requirements or their
contractual obligations to us, or act inappropriately in the conduct of their business, our business and reputation
could be negatively affected or penalties could be directly imposed on us.

In addition, we depend on banking systems to execute payment transactions in connection with our
business. A systematic shutdown or any other disruption of the banking industry or one of the banks we work with
would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of clients and to collect on claims. Any of the foregoing
factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We rely partly on data provided by multiple credit information suppliers and other sources in order to
operate our business, and our UK operations, in particular, rely on the data provided substantially by one supplier.
Our business, along with the businesses of our competitors, could be negatively affected if any third-party sources
were to stop providing this data for any reason, including a change in laws or regulations, or if they were to raise
the price of their services. In addition, any disruption of our relationship with our data suppliers could affect the
intelligence systems upon which we rely. See “—We are highly dependent on our intelligence systems and
_proprietary consumer profiles” and “—We generate a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of_
_large clients and we are dependent on a small number of key suppliers” for further discussion. Furthermore, if_
data suppliers provide us with inaccurate data, we may have no recourse against them if we are exposed to claims
by our clients, consumers, or alleged debtors arising from the use of such inaccurate data, which may also lead to
reputational damage. Conversely, through our subsidiaries we provide data to third parties as well and there is a
risk that data provided by us may prove to be inaccurate or false and third parties could take recourse against us
for providing false data.

In certain situations, we outsource some of our UK Division’s accounts to third-party DCAs for
collection. For example, we may use third-party DCAs late in the collections process when our in-house methods
of contact have not succeeded or when an atypical consumer may be better served by a specialist DCA (e.g., when
the debt collection process is complicated by probate). Any failure by these third parties to adequately perform
collection services for us or to remit such collections to us could materially reduce our cash flow, income and
profits. We rely on these third parties to effectively manage their operations and to meet our servicing needs
efficiently, but these third parties may not have the resources, management training and management depth that
we have. This may negatively impact their ability to comply with applicable laws or other regulatory requirements.
To the extent these third parties violate laws or other regulatory requirements in their collection efforts, it could
negatively impact our business and reputation, and we may not be aware of the risk or occurrence of any such
violation.

If any of these suppliers were to significantly limit access to their services, significantly raise their prices,
experience labor disputes and work stoppages, become insolvent or cease to exist, this could impede our ability
to collect on claims or increase our collections costs and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

Any of these developments could hinder or prevent us from using our decision science as part of our
business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our recent acquisitions or our future acquisitions or business combinations may prove unsuccessful or they_**
**_may strain or divert our resources, and we may not be able to manage our growth effectively._**

Our strategy involves selectively acquiring businesses to increase our market share. Since 2016, we have
acquired IS Inkasso Service, Tesch Group, Apontas, Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS, Lucas Credit Services Ltd and
Solvencia AS.

The continuation of this strategy depends on, inter alia, identifying suitable acquisition or investment
opportunities and successfully completing such transactions. There can be no assurances that we will be able to
identify or complete purchases or acquisitions in the future. Furthermore, it may take longer than expected to
realize projected benefits from such future purchases or acquisitions because we often cannot control the timing


-----

of the closing of such transactions. Moreover, successful completion of an acquisition may depend on consents
from third parties, including regulatory authorities and private parties, which are beyond our control.

If we carve-out in-house collections operations from our clients or wholly acquire other CMS companies,
we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses with our own and we may be unable to maintain our
standards, controls and policies, which may result in compliance issues, goodwill write offs and damage to our
reputation. Our successful integration of acquired businesses will depend on our ability to effect any required
changes in operations or personnel, and may require other capital expenditure or the funding of unforeseen
liabilities. In addition, the integration and operation of any future acquisitions may expose us to certain risks,
including difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses in a cost effective manner and establishing effective
management information and financial control systems, the diversion of management’s attention from our dayto-day business, the failure to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided, transition
difficulties with clients and unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the
acquisitions. Any failure to assess suitable acquisitions or to properly integrate them once acquired could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There can be no assurances that any of the anticipated benefits from our prior acquisitions will be realized
or that we will be able to realize such benefits from any future acquisition. In addition, our acquisitions and future
acquisitions may place additional constraints on our resources, including diverting the attention of our
management from other business concerns or opportunities. Furthermore, acquisitions expose us to the risks
associated with write-downs and impairments to goodwill.

Integration of the businesses and carve-out assets we acquire may require significant financial and
operating resources and exposes us to a variety of risks. For example, our ability to maintain our standards,
controls, policies and the quality of services that we have historically provided could be compromised while we
are in the process of integrating a recently acquired business, and this could result in compliance issues, goodwill
write-downs and damage to our reputation. Additionally, the successful integration of any businesses we acquire
depends on our ability to make required changes in operations or personnel quickly and effectively, and achieving
this may require further capital expenditure or the funding of unforeseen liabilities. Moreover, difficulties with
establishing effective management information and financial control systems, the diversion of management’s
attention from our day-to-day business, difficulties with transitioning clients and unforeseen legal, regulatory,
contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisitions could also arise in connection with our integration
of acquired businesses.

In March 2018 we acquired Lowell Sverige and Lowell AS and in July 2019 we acquired Lucas Credit
Services Ltd. We have made efforts to integrate these new entities into our corporate division and will perform
similar integration activities for Solvencia AS which was acquired on September 30, 2020; however, there can be
no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that we will realize the expected benefit, or any benefit at all,
from these acquisitions.

We currently operate primarily in the UK, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Austria
with a meaningful presence in Switzerland. If we expand into new jurisdictions through future acquisitions, our
business will be subject to applicable laws, regulations and licensing requirements in those new jurisdictions,
which may be different or more stringent than those currently applicable to our business. Such expansion would
also subject us to additional risks related to inflation, recession, currency and interest rate fluctuations, an inability
to enforce remedies, difficulty in adequately establishing, staffing and managing operations, risk of noncompliance and business integrity issues, variations in regulation and governmental policies, including additional
fees, costs and licenses, and risk of political and social instability within those jurisdictions.

There can be no assurances that we will be able to manage our growth effectively and that our
infrastructure, facilities and personnel will be adequate to support our future operations or to effectively adapt to
future growth. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_We are highly dependent on our intelligence systems and proprietary consumer profiles._**

Certain systems provide information that is critical to our business. In order to operate these systems,
develop our proprietary consumer profiles and run our business generally, we rely to a large extent on data
provided to us by a single private credit reference agency. If this private supplier were to terminate its agreement
with us or stop providing us with data for any reason, or if such private supplier were to considerably raise the
price of its services, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Also, if any of the information or


-----

data that we use became public, for example due to a change in government regulations, or if the UK were to
introduce measures that have the effect of facilitating the tracing of consumers, we would lose a significant
competitive advantage and our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, private or public sources of
our data could make claims that the way in which we collect or use information and data violates terms and
conditions applicable to such use, and whether or not such claims have any merit, our reputation could be harmed
and our ability to continue to use such information and data in the manner in which it is currently used could be
impaired. If our competitors are able to develop or procure similar systems or methods to develop data, or if we
become unable to continue to acquire or use such information and data in the manner in which it is currently
acquired and used, we would lose a significant competitive advantage and our business could be materially and
adversely affected. If we were prohibited from accessing or aggregating the data in these systems or profiles for
any reason, our operations and financial condition would be negatively and materially impacted. See “—We are
_subject to EU, UK, German and Norwegian regulations, among others, and changes to the regulatory_
_environment or a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, authorizations, licenses and codes of_
_practice may negatively affect our business—Laws and Regulations affecting our Processing of Personal Data.”_

In addition, for certain of the systems, technologies and programs that we use, we rely on specialist IT
providers. Some of these providers are small companies and their long-term financial viability cannot be assured.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to find and retain alternative providers or acquire the rights to
intellectual property important to our operations if our current or future providers become financially unstable. To
the extent any of these systems, technologies or programs do not function properly and we cannot find and retain
a suitable IT provider to help remedy the fault, we may experience material adverse effects on our business that
require substantial additional investments to remedy, or which we may not be able to remedy at all.

Furthermore, as some of the systems, technologies and programs that we use have been developed
internally, we cannot be assured that our level of development documentation is comparable to that of third party
software packages and we may have certain employees that possess important, undocumented knowledge of our
systems. If any such employee were no longer to work for us, our ability to maintain, repair or modify our
collections platform may be limited.

**_We may not be able to successfully maintain and develop our IT infrastructure platform or decision science_**
**_systems, anticipate, manage or adopt technological advances within our industry or prevent a breach or_**
**_disruption of the security of our IT infrastructure platform and decision science systems._**

We rely on our IT infrastructure platform and decision science systems and our ability to integrate these
technologies into our business is essential to our competitive position and our success. This dependency subjects
us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems as
well as reliance on certain external suppliers for the ongoing provision of support services, including impairment
of our information technology, substantial capital expenditures and demands on management time. For example,
the carve-out of in-house collection operations or the acquisition of another company may force us to upgrade the
IT platform and decision science systems of the newly acquired operations or entity to meet our standards, causing
increased capital expenditures and demands on management time.

IT and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life
cycles. We may not be successful in anticipating, managing or adopting technological changes on a timely basis.
We may not be successful in implementing improvements of our IT or decision science systems and improving
operation efficiency through further IT development, which could result in additional costs. The cost of these
improvements could be higher than anticipated or result in management not being able to devote sufficient
attention to other areas of our business. We depend on having the capital resources necessary to invest in new
technologies to purchase and service claims, and there can be no assurances that adequate capital resources will
be available to us at the appropriate time. Furthermore, if we become unable to continue to acquire, aggregate or
use such information and data in the manner or to the extent in which it is currently acquired, aggregated and used,
due to lack of resources, regulatory restrictions or any other reason, we may lose a significant competitive
advantage. For example, in Germany we hold a data trading license that provides us with the future potential to
enter into the data trading field and leverage our extensive databases. However, this and other potential initiatives
are not yet fully developed and may not achieve their desired results, which could cause us to lose valuable market
opportunities and fall behind our competition in advanced decision science.

Any security breach in our IT infrastructure platform and decision science systems, or any temporary or
permanent failure in these systems, could disrupt our operations. We may be required to enhance capabilities and
resilience and we may be subject to future attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential or sensitive
information. Our websites could potentially suffer cyber-attacks, which could disrupt our IT infrastructure


-----

platform and decision science systems and impair our ability to provide online services. In addition, in the event
of a catastrophic occurrence, our ability to protect our infrastructure and maintain ongoing operations could be
significantly impaired. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans cover the majority of our systems and
services, but may not be successful in mitigating the effects of a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, flood,
tornado, power loss, sabotage or telecommunications failure for some or all of our IT infrastructure platform and
decision science systems. Any of these developments could hinder or prevent us from using our IT infrastructure
platform or decision science systems as part of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our operations could suffer from telecommunications or technology downtime, increased technology costs or_**
**_an inability to successfully anticipate, manage or adopt technological advances within our industry._**

Our success depends on sophisticated telecommunications and computer equipment, as well as software
systems. In the normal course of our business, we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly
and accurately to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for our pricing and collection activities. We
also use these systems to identify and contact large numbers of consumers and record the results of our collection
efforts. These systems could be interrupted by terrorist acts, natural disasters, power losses, computer viruses or
similar events. Any failure of our systems, especially if it also impacts our backup or disaster recovery systems,
would disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our business. Any temporary or permanent loss
of our ability to use our telecommunications or computer equipment and software systems could disrupt our
operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, financial returns or results of operations.

Furthermore, our business depends heavily on services provided by various internet service providers
and local and long distance telephone companies. Our ability to use telecommunications systems to contact
consumers is governed by Data Protection Laws and telecommunications and privacy requirements and regulatory
rules and guidance issued by regulators. These may change and may make using, accessing, transferring or storing
consumer documentation more onerous in the future. If our equipment or systems cease to work or it becomes
difficult to continue to use them in the same manner as we do today as a result of any regulatory development, we
may be prevented from providing services and we may not be able to collect on the receivables we have purchased.
We may face similar consequences if there is any change in the telecommunications market that would affect our
ability to obtain favorable rates on communication services or if there is any significant interruption in internet or
telephone services. Since we generally recognize revenue and generate operating cash flow primarily through
collections, any failure or interruption of services and collections would mean that we would continue to incur
payroll and other expenses without any corresponding income.

Additionally, computer and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized
by short product life cycles. We may not be successful in anticipating, managing or adopting technological
changes on a timely basis, which could reduce our profitability or disrupt our operations and harm our business.
While we believe that our existing information systems are sufficient to meet our current demands and continued
expansion, our future growth may require additional investment in these systems. We depend on having the capital
resources necessary to invest in new technologies to acquire and service our debt portfolios. We cannot ensure
you that adequate capital resources will be available to us when we need to make such investments.

**_Improper disclosure of our clients’ sensitive data, consumer data or a breach of Data Protection Laws could_**
**_negatively affect our business or reputation._**

We handle and process large amounts of potentially sensitive or confidential information, such as
personal information of consumers, including names and account numbers, locations, contact information and
other account specific data. Any security or privacy breaches of these databases could expose us to liability,
increase our expenses relating to resolution of these breaches, harm our reputation and deter clients from
conducting business with us. We rely on our decision science systems to record and process significant amounts
of data quickly and accurately to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for our debt collection and for
our analysis of potential debt purchases. Our ability to conduct our business, including our ability to price the
purchase of portfolios, trace consumers and develop tailored repayment plans, depends on our ability to use
consumer data in our decision science systems.

Our ability to obtain, retain, share and otherwise process consumer data is governed by Data Protection
Laws, privacy requirements and other regulatory restrictions. For example, in Germany and the UK, personal data
may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and may only be processed in a manner
consistent with these purposes. Furthermore, the processing of personal data must be adequate, relevant and
limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed, and it must not be kept in a form


-----

that permits identification of consumers for a longer period of time than necessary for the purposes of the
collection or other legal obligations, _e.g., in Germany, obligations pursuant to the German Commercial Code_
(Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB)). See “—We are subject to EU, UK, German and Norwegian regulations, among
_others, and changes to the regulatory environment or a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations,_
_authorizations, licenses and codes of practice may negatively affect our business—Laws and Regulations affecting_
_our Processing of Personal Data”. In addition, we are subject to strict data protection requirements in many of_
the other jurisdictions in which we operate.

We may not be able to prevent the improper disclosure or processing of such sensitive information in
breach of contract and applicable law. These databases and consumer data are vulnerable to damage from a variety
of sources, including telecommunications and network failures and natural disasters. The databases are also
vulnerable to human acts both by individuals outside of the Group as well as our employees, including fraud,
identity theft and other misuse of personal data. Moreover, our systems may be subject to physical or electronic
break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Any security or privacy breach of these databases
could expose us to liability, increase our expenses relating to the resolution of these breaches, harm our reputation
and deter vendors from selling debt to us. Any material failure to process consumer data in compliance with
applicable laws could result in the revocation of our licenses, monetary fines, criminal charges and breach of
contractual arrangements. Any issue of data protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.

**_Failure to protect our consumer data from unauthorized use or provide adequate data protection could_**
**_negatively affect our business._**

Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our consumer data could cause us to lose a competitive
advantage. We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures to protect our
consumer data, and our consumer data is stored and protected in our IT infrastructure platform with access
limitations in accordance with our technical and organizational measures. These measures afford only limited
protection, and competitors or others may gain access to our consumer data. Our consumer data could be subject
to unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure, despite our having required our employees, consultants and
clients to enter into confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurances that such confidentiality agreements
will not be breached or will be of sufficient duration and that adequate remedies will be available in the event of
an unauthorized use or disclosure. Policing unauthorized use of such rights can be difficult and expensive, and
adequate remedies may not be available or available in an acceptable time frame. A failure to protect our consumer
data from unauthorized use, or to comply with current applicable or future laws or regulations, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our confidentiality agreements may be breached, or may fail to protect our proprietary processes and systems._**

We rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade
secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Certain of our employees possess valuable trade secrets
about our models, consumer databases and our business processes, and the risk of disclosure of such proprietary
know-how could be heightened if any such employee ceases to work for us. While it is our policy to enter into
confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary know-how, there can
be no assurance that:

    - our confidentiality agreements will not be breached or will be of sufficient duration;

    - such agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how;
or

    - adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of these trade
secrets and know-how.

In addition, there can be no assurances that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets
through independent development or other access by legal means.

We may initiate lawsuits to enforce our confidentiality agreements and the ownership of our intellectual
property. Initiating litigation relating to intellectual property rights is costly and may divert technical and
management personnel from their day-to-day responsibilities. In many cases it may not be possible to initiate a
lawsuit prior to the disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, at which point the damage to our
competitive position may be severe or irreparable. Furthermore, we may not prevail in any such litigation or


-----

proceeding. A determination in a proceeding that results in a finding of non-infringement or non-violation by
others of our intellectual property or confidential agreements may result in the use by competitors of our
technologies or processes, which may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, financial
returns and results of operations.

**_Our risk management procedures may fail to identify or anticipate future risks._**

We continually review our risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so in the
future. Although we believe that our risk management procedures are adequate, many of our methods of managing
risk and exposures are based upon observed historical market behavior and statistic-based historical models. As a
result, these methods may not accurately predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than
historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend on the evaluation of information regarding
markets, debt originators, DCAs, consumers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to
us. We rely on intermediaries such as DCAs, and we may be held liable for the acts of intermediaries if we cannot
demonstrate that we have adequate procedures in place to prevent risks such as bribery. For example, debt
originators typically require us to assume responsibility for the acts of their respective third-party intermediaries
in relation to ongoing compliance matters. Furthermore, we keep track of employee misconduct and have policies
and procedures in place to minimize its impact, but these procedures may not prove sufficient (for example, to
avoid employee fraud). Failure (or the perception that we have failed) to develop, implement, monitor and, when
necessary, preemptively upgrade our risk management policies and procedures could, at the very least, give rise
to reputational issues for both us and any associated debt originators, and may result in breaches of contractual
obligations by us, for which we may incur substantial losses and face removal from debt originators’ purchasing
panels. Risks that we fail to anticipate, and/or adequately address, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Loss of one or more members of senior management or a significant number of trained personnel could_**
**_negatively affect our business._**

Our future success depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management and other key
personnel and our ability to retain such members of our senior management team and other key employees. We
may not be able to retain our executive officers and key management personnel or attract additional qualified
management in the future. The loss of the services of our senior management and other key personnel could
seriously impair our ability to continue to purchase portfolios or collect claims and to manage and expand our
business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition, our growth requires that we continually hire and train new consumer account associates
(each, a “CAA”). As is typical among companies that rely on call center operations in the UK market, employee
turnover among CAAs in our UK Division has been significant. For example, as of December 31, 2019, the
average tenure of our CAAs in the UK was 36 months. Increases in the turnover rate among our CAAs at any of
our companies could increase our recruiting and training costs and limit the number of experienced personnel
available to service our and our clients’ portfolios. If this were to occur, we would not be able to service such
portfolios effectively and the constraint on our resources may reduce our ability to continue our growth and to
operate profitably. The demand in our industry for personnel with the relevant capabilities and experience is high
and our success in attracting and retaining employees is not guaranteed. There can be no assurances that we will
be able to continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to maintain adequate staffing
levels or to be flexible enough to react to changing market environments.

We also have a number of employees who possess critical knowledge about our IT infrastructure
platform, decision science systems and our debt purchase operations, and an inability to retain these employees
could negatively impact our business. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages could negatively affect our business._**

Our financial performance is affected by the cost of labor. As of June 30, 2020, the Group had
approximately 3,966 FTEs. An increased demand for our employees from competitors could increase costs
associated with employee compensation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

In the UK, although no union has reached the membership threshold required for formal recognition, if
any union were to reach membership levels of 10% or more of our UK Division’s total employees and were to be


-----

formally recognized, such union would need to be consulted on a number of business decisions affecting its
members’ terms of employment. In addition, if the unions to which our UK employees currently belong were to
consolidate, or if any union were to attract more employees, that union may seek employment terms that could
adversely affect the stability of our work force and increase our costs.

Our German employees have established a company works council (Konzernbetriebsrat), two joint
works councils (Gesamtbetriebsräte) and seven works councils (Betriebsräte). We also have two collective
bargaining agreements (Manteltarifverträge) currently in force for German employees who were carved out of
our clients’ operations. In accordance with the German One-Third Participation Act (Drittelbeteiligungsgesetz) in
connection with applicable provisions of the Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), we have established a
Supervisory Board (Aufsichtsrat).

The Northern European Division’s employees are unionized and/or represented by works councils in
many of the countries in which it operates.

Any move by our employees toward further unionization or any other labor relations disputes or work
stoppages and/or strikes could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.

**_Litigation, investigations and proceedings may negatively affect our business._**

We may be adversely affected by judgments, settlements, unanticipated costs or other effects of legal
and administrative proceedings now pending or that may be instituted in the future, or from investigations by
authorities, regulatory bodies or administrative agencies. There are certain lawsuits pending, which, if the
outcomes are resolved against us in a way that materially differs from our expectations, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We may become subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings, including
consumer credit disputes with consumers, labor disputes, contract disputes, intellectual property disputes,
environmental proceedings, government audits and proceedings, tax audits and disputes and client disputes. In
some proceedings, the claimant may seek damages as well as other remedies, which, if granted, would require
expenditures on our part, and we may ultimately incur costs relating to these proceedings that exceed our present
or future financial accruals or insurance coverage. Even if we or our directors, officers and employees (as the case
may be) are not ultimately found to be liable, defending claims or lawsuits could be expensive and time
consuming, divert management resources, damage our reputation and attract regulatory inquiries. Any of these
developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in consumers’ propensity to bring claims related to
debt collection to the courts in their attempts to claim refunds of sums paid under consumer credit agreements or
to avoid making payments going forward. This litigation has been fueled by a substantial rise in claims
management companies that aggressively advertise for potential claimants and then bring claims in the hope and
expectation that they will be paid a portion of any debt written off. Substantial complaint volumes have been made
in the UK in relation to premiums for mis-sold PPI (which can form part of the debt being collected) and other
types of charges added onto credit accounts. Claims could also be brought in relation to other areas of alleged
noncompliance, which could affect a large portfolio of agreements. We may in the future be named as defendants
in litigation, including under consumer credit, collections and other laws. We may also have disagreements or
disputes with sellers from which we purchase debt, parties to which we outsource accounts, business partners who
collect claims on our behalf or other counterparties. For example, certain law firm parties with whom we contract
for collection services have asserted claims against us relating to our agreed fee structure and, in connection with
the winding down of similar relationships with other business partners in Germany in particular, we may face
additional claims. Such claims against us, complaints, disputes or disagreements, regardless of merit, could result
in or subject us to costly litigation and divert our management personnel from their regular responsibilities.
Furthermore, if such claims are adversely determined against us, we could be forced to suspend certain collection
efforts or pay damages, and our reputation, financial condition, financial returns and results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected.

**_Our collections may decrease and/or the timing of when we collect be delayed if the number of consumers_**
**_becoming subject to personal insolvency procedures increases._**

We recover on claims that may become subject to insolvency procedures under applicable laws and we
also purchase portfolios containing claims that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings. In the UK, these


-----

include individual consumers who may have an individual voluntary arrangement with their creditors. In
Germany, these include insolvency proceedings regarding natural persons (Verbraucher).

Various economic trends and potential changes to existing legislation may contribute to an increase in
the number of consumers subject to personal insolvency procedures. Under some insolvency procedures, a
person’s assets may be sold to repay creditors, but because the debt portfolios that we service are generally
unsecured, we are generally unable to collect on such debt portfolios through these proceedings. Therefore, our
ability to successfully collect on portfolios may decline, or the timing of our collections on portfolios may be
delayed, as a result of an increase in personal insolvency procedures. These scenarios could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may be unable to enforce accounts where any underlying debt documentation is legally defective._**

When we commence enforcement actions through legal proceedings, courts may require a copy of the
account statements or applications to be attached to the pleadings in order to obtain a judgment against a particular
consumer. Where we are unable to produce account documents in response to a consumer’s request, that account
would be legally unenforceable. Furthermore, if any of the account documents we do have were found to be legally
unenforceable, courts may deny our claims. Any changes to laws, regulations or rules that affect the manner in
which we initiate enforcement proceedings, including rules affecting documentation, could result in increased
administration costs or limit the availability of litigation as a collection tool, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, our ability to collect by means other than legal
proceedings may be impacted by laws that require that certain types of account documentation be in our possession
prior to the institution of any collection activities, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations.

**_We may purchase portfolios that contain accounts that are not eligible to be collected, including due to defects_**
**_in consumer documentation that may make the credit agreements unenforceable, and an enforcement of_**
**_related claims may be difficult._**

In the normal course of our debt portfolio purchases, and in the management of any forward flow
agreements that we may enter into from time to time, some individual accounts may be included in the portfolios
that fail to conform to the terms of the purchase contracts or that we do not have the regulatory permissions to
collect upon, and we may seek to return these accounts to the debt originator for payment or replacement. Such
debt originator may, however, be unable to meet its obligations to us or we may not identify non-conforming
accounts soon enough, or at all, to qualify for recourse to the debt originator. Furthermore, our debt purchase
agreements impose or may impose restrictions on our ability to return non-conforming accounts by imposing a
minimum threshold value that must be met. Each contract specifies which accounts are eligible and which are not.
Examples of ineligible accounts could include those that have a foreign address, those that have been subject to
fraud, those that have an incorrect balance or those involving a consumer serving time in prison. Accounts that
would be eligible for recourse if discovered in a timely fashion, but that we do not discover in time for such
recourse, are likely to yield no return.

If we fail to identify whether our requirements are met during the due diligence process undertaken
during a debt purchase transaction, the applicable credit agreement may become unenforceable and require us to
undertake a remediation exercise that may result in balance adjustments and/or cash refunds due on the purchased
accounts. In some cases, such remediation exercises may result in the amounts of compensation exceeding the
purchase price and therefore resulting in total loss of the portfolio value and potentially additional expenditure on
our part. The quality of historical consumer documentation may not allow, in each case, the discovery of past
breaches relating to form and content requirements that would impair our ability to correctly assess the value of
the portfolio, resulting in the risk of loss or reduction in the particular owned debt portfolio’s value.

As our business relies on our ability to enforce the contracts underlying our owned consumer accounts,
a contract found to be invalid or unenforceable could hinder our ability to recover from purchased accounts. If we
purchase debt portfolios containing too many accounts that do not conform to the terms of the purchase contracts
or contain accounts that are otherwise uncollectable or unenforceable, we may be unable to recover a sufficient
amount, or anything at all, and such a portfolio purchase could be unprofitable. Additionally, we may be unable
to ascertain whether the debt originator has been in compliance in connection with the underlying accounts at a
sufficiently early stage. With respect to any future acquisitions of other debt collection companies, we may not
have any contractual protection in relation to liabilities or operating or other problems in relation to the loan
portfolios of the acquired company, and we may not discover such shortcomings until after completion of such


-----

acquisitions. This could lead to adverse accounting and financial consequences, such as the need to make
substantial provisions against the acquired assets or to write down acquired assets.

For a significant number of portfolios, particularly in Germany, we act as beneficial owner. We may not
be able to collect on a portfolio to which someone else holds legal ownership, or we may need to spend time and
resources establishing our own legal ownership of the portfolio if such ownership was unclear. Moreover, in
instances where underlying documentation does not prove the existence, ownership or enforceability of an
account, or where an account balance is incorrect, we may not always have the right to transfer such accounts
back to the debt originator. Additionally, in such instances, we may be contractually required to repurchase
accounts that we have subsequently sold to third parties.

Furthermore, enforcement of claims under German law generally requires a creditor to obtain an
execution title (Vollstreckungstitel). An execution title is not automatically transferred with the underlying claim.
An execution title is generally rendered in the name of a specific creditor that has the sole right to enforce the
claim. Although for many of our German portfolio debt purchases we benefit from acting as a beneficial owner
with the original creditor as trustee, which allows us to enforce on the basis of existing execution titles, we may
not be able to enforce the claim using the existing execution title if the original creditor is no longer available to
serve as trustee, e.g., in the event that the creditor is liquidated. We also may not use an existing execution title if
we are the legal owner of the claim. In such situations, an execution title must be amended by way of a
circumscription of title (Titelumschreibung), subject to certain legal requirements set forth by the German Code
of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung). This procedure allows other persons who are not named in the respective
execution title to use it for enforcement. The circumscription of title bears additional cost and time that is incurred
for any single claim and may result in considerable additional expense. Additionally, under certain circumstances
it may be difficult or impossible to achieve a circumscription of title, e.g., if the documentation required by law
is not available or the original creditor ceases to exist, which may prevent us from enforcing a claim.

Any of the foregoing factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, financial
returns and results of operations.

**_Historical operating results and quarterly cash collections may not be indicative of future performance._**

Our past performance may not be indicative of future operating results. Our results of operations and
financial condition are dependent on our ability to generate collections from overdue receivables, which in turn is
impacted by the ability of consumers to pay. The ability of consumers to refinance their existing debt, as well as
annual cycles in disposable income, could result in a reduction in the volume of NPLs available for collection or
purchase. Furthermore, collections within portfolios tend to be lower in months where there are fewer working
days, for example months with public holidays. In addition, we are exposed to quarterly variations in our operating
results, which may be affected by the timing of the closing of debt portfolio purchases, which we often cannot
control and may be uneven during the year, and the speed with which we can integrate the portfolios into our
systems. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

The historical financial information included in this Offering Memorandum are not representative of the
current operations of the Group and may not be comparable to our current operating results.

As a result of our numerous acquisitions and dispositions over the past three years, the historical financial
statements of the Group included in this Offering Memorandum do not reflect what our results of operations,
financial position and cash flows would have been in those periods had all of our current businesses operated on
a consolidated basis during such periods, and may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial
position and cash flows will be in the future.

In addition, the historical financial information included in this Offering Memorandum may not be
comparable due to the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with effect from January 1, 2018, IFRS 15
Revenue from Contracts with Customers with effect from January 1, 2019 and IFRS 16 Leases with effect from
January 1, 2019.

In light of the foregoing, the historical financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is
not representative of the current operations of the Group and may not be comparable to our current operating
results.

**_We are not providing pro forma financial statements reflecting the impact of the 2018 Acquisitions on our_**
**_historical results and the Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information included in this Offering_**
**_Memorandum may not represent what the actual consolidated results of operations of the Group would have_**
**_been if the 2018 Acquisitions had occurred at January 1, 2018._**

Although this Offering Memorandum includes historical financial statements for the Group, it does not
include pro forma financial statements reflecting the estimated pro forma impact of the 2018 Acquisitions on our
historical results for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2018 or
2017, respectively.

Solely for the convenience of readers, we include in this Offering Memorandum certain Unaudited Pro
_forma Consolidated Financial Information of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2018, consisting of (i)_
the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which reflect the operations of Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS
and their subsidiaries from April 1, 2018, and (ii) the unaudited consolidated results of Lowell Sverige, Lowell
AS and their subsidiaries (the “Nordics Carve-out”) for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Unaudited
_Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information reflects the following adjustments: (i) the assets and liabilities of_
the Nordics Carve-out were recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations),
requiring purchase price adjustments to certain assets, primarily existing customer relationships and owned debt
portfolios; (ii) the ERC curves of the Nordic Carve-out’s owned debt portfolios were adjusted from 180-months
to 120-months; (iii) finance costs were adjusted as if the 2018 Acquisitions, including the issuance of the Existing
Hansa Notes and other related financing transactions, had occurred on January 1, 2018 and (iv) income tax
(expense) / credit was adjusted in accordance with the above. The unaudited consolidated financial information
of the Nordics Carve-out for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were calculated by adding the unaudited
consolidated financial information of Lowell Sverige and its subsidiaries (the “Lowell Swedish Group”) for the
period to the consolidated financial information of Lowell AS and its subsidiaries (the “Lowell Norwegian
**Group”) for the period.**

The accounting principles and policies applied by each of the Group, the Lowell Swedish Group and the
Lowell Norwegian Group are not directly comparable. The unaudited consolidated financial information of the
Lowell Swedish Group for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial
Statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS, whereas the unaudited consolidated financial information of
the Lowell Norwegian Group was prepared in accordance with Norwegian GAAP. Norwegian GAAP differs in
certain respects from IFRS. For example, under Norwegian GAAP, actuarial gains and losses related to pension
schemes need not be recognized in the income statement, and the obligation and expense for the period will be
different from the figures under IFRS. The financial assumptions with regards to unrecognized actuarial gains and
losses under Norwegian GAAP and IFRS may also differ. In addition, under Norwegian GAAP, local regulation
requires the Lowell Norwegian Group to include an accrual for revenue for 3PC in progress at the balance sheet
date, while this item is not reported in IFRS. Moreover, although the financial statements of both the Group and
the Lowell Swedish Group are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the accounting policies of the two groups may
differ in certain respects. As such, the various elements of the financial statements of the Group, the Lowell
Swedish Group and the Lowell Norwegian Group may be significantly different and an addition of the elements
of each group may differ significantly from the result that would have been achieved in the context of pro forma
financial statements.

As a result of the differences in accounting principles and policies described above, the financial results
as calculated by each of the Lowell Norwegian Group and the Lowell Swedish Group may differ from the Group’s
calculation of these metrics, and such differences could affect our Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial
Information.

This Unaudited _Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information of the Group has not been audited or_
reviewed, does not indicate future results, has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards and should not be
considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally
accepted accounting principles. You should not place undue reliance on such Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated
Financial Information of the Group, and no opinion or any other form of assurance is provided with respect thereto.

Management has not prepared this Unaudited _Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information in_
accordance with the regulations of the SEC, is for informational purposes only and does not necessarily present
what our results would actually have been had the 2018 Acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2018, nor should
it be used as the basis of projections of our results of operations or financial condition for any future period and
should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of the Group. See also

and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

**_We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations._**

We have operations throughout Europe and are therefore exposed to financial risks that arise from
changes in exchange rates. Currency exchange fluctuations could cause losses if assets denominated in currencies
with a falling exchange rate lose value, while at the same time liabilities denominated in currencies with a rising
exchange rate appreciate. As a result of these factors, fluctuations in exchange rates could affect our results of
operations. For example, we present our consolidated financial reports in pound sterling but the operations of our
DACH Division are primarily conducted in euro. In addition, the Northern European Division is active across
Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland and conducts business in several currencies. Our business is therefore
sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, especially euro to pound sterling exchange rates. The
presentation of our results of operations may be affected by the translation of foreign currencies into pound sterling
for the purpose of our consolidated financial statements. We do not currently hedge any of our foreign exchange
risks. Consequently, to the extent that foreign exchange rate exposures are not hedged, fluctuations in currencies
may adversely affect our financial results in ways unrelated to our operations. For example, decreases in the value
of the pound sterling relative to the euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona or Norwegian krone may have a positive
impact on the results of operations presented in our consolidated financial reports solely due to the effects of
translating the results of operations from our DACH Division and the Northern European Division from euro,
Danish krone, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone into pound sterling. A positive impact on the results of
operations presented in our consolidated financial reports due to decreases in the value of pounds sterling relative
to the euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona or Norwegian krone may overstate the underlying performance and
results of operations of our business or suggest an improvement in the performance and results of operations of
our business when, after adjusting for the effects of currency translations, no such improvement has occurred or
a deterioration has occurred. Conversely, increases in the value of the pound sterling relative to the euro, Danish
krone, Swedish krona or Norwegian krone may have a negative impact on the results of operations presented in
our consolidated financial reports solely due to the effects of translating the results of operations from our DACH
Division and the Northern European Division from euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone into
pound sterling. A negative impact on the results of operations presented in our consolidated financial reports due
to increases in the value of pounds sterling relative to the euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona or Norwegian krone
may understate the underlying performance and results of operations of our business or suggest a deterioration in
the performance and results of operations of our business when, after adjusting for the effects of currency
translations, no such deterioration has occurred or an improvement has occurred. Any of these developments could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that
hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, if we were
to use any hedging transactions in the future in the form of derivative financial instruments, such transactions may
result in market-to-market losses and may prove to be ineffective.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under
the Notes and the Note Guarantees or cause the market price of the Notes to decline.

**_Uneven debt portfolio supply patterns may prevent us from pursuing all of the debt purchase opportunities we_**
**_would like to pursue and may result in our experiencing uneven cash flows and financial results._**

Debt portfolios do not become available for purchase on a consistent basis throughout the year.
Accordingly, there may be times when a number of portfolios, or particularly large portfolios, are available for
purchase at similar times, which may prevent us, due to restrictions in our funding ability, from pursuing all of
the then available debt purchase opportunities. As a result, we may fail to maintain our market share. The
inconsistency in the availability of debt portfolios for purchase may mean that during certain financial reporting
periods we may make few or no purchases of debt portfolios. In addition, large purchases at the end of a financial
period would likely have a material and adverse effect on our reported financial ratios. See _“Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

It is not unusual to experience a gap between the time of acquisition of a debt portfolio and the time that
we begin earning returns on the acquired portfolio as we need to locate consumers, build a consolidated profile of
each such consumer’s circumstances and formulate an appropriate repayment solution before we can start to
collect on an acquired portfolio. As a result, we may experience uneven cash flows and delays in generating


-----

income from purchased loan portfolios. For example, if we were to acquire a material portfolio at the end of a
reporting period, then this would increase our net debt or reduce our cash on hand without generating cash or
contributing to Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA for the relevant period. See “—We may not be able to procure
_sufficient funding on favorable terms to purchase further debt portfolios as they become available.”_

**_Rising interest rates could impair the ability of our consumers to pay their debt, which could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our financial condition, financial returns and results of operations._**

Rising interest rates could impair the financial viability of consumers who have variable interest rate
obligations or other significant debt that bears floating rate interest. If our consumers experience a reduced ability
to pay their debt, debt collection agencies may require higher commissions to address increased collection activity
costs, and we could face higher payment plan default rates and lower average payments, any of which could
reduce our cash generation or prolong the time required to collect cash, and reduce our return on capital and on
ERC. Even if we are able to develop payment plans in relation to certain of these obligations, such measures may
prove unsuccessful. Furthermore, we could more quickly reach a point of saturation with certain consumers (i.e.,
the number of accounts matched to a consumer may reach a point at which that consumer lacks the financial
means to pay on all of the accounts that we own). Even if our efforts were to prove successful in avoiding some
defaults, total collections may still decline or the timing of receipt of payments may lengthen, any of which would
impair our financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may enter into interest rate hedges in the future which may be ineffective or may not be implemented_**
**_correctly._**

Although we are subject to the risk of changes in interest rates, we no longer use interest rate swaps to
hedge the effect of changes in the interest rate on our profit and loss. We may enter into interest rate hedges in the
future, and at such time we may be subject to the risk of changes in interest rates and their impact on our derivative
instruments. We may use interest rate swaps to hedge the effect of changes in the interest rate on our profit and
loss. We may further hedge parts of our cash-flow risk that arises out of variable interest agreements on the
refinancing side. We may enter into a derivative contract by paying fixed interest payments in exchange for
receiving floating rate interest payments. When interest rates rise, our unhedged floating rate and new financing
costs rise (to the extent we are party to relevant instruments), thereby reducing our profit or increasing our loss,
but we may also receive higher interest income from our derivative instruments, which would offset (to the extent
of such increase in income) the decline in profit or increase in loss from the rise in financing costs. Conversely,
when interest rates decline, our unhedged floating rate and new financing costs decline (to the extent we are party
to relevant instruments), thereby increasing our profit or decreasing our loss, but our interest income from any of
our derivative instruments would decline, thus offsetting (to the extent of such decrease in income) any changes
to profit and loss due to interest rate movements. At such time as we enter into hedges, we will be subject to the
risk that there is a mismatch either between the interest swap performance and the change in the underlying
funding cost that the derivative instruments are structured to hedge. We may also be exposed to the risk that our
hedges could be implemented or priced incorrectly. Volatility in interest rates could impact valuation of interest
rate swaps and therefore impair our ability to enter into these contracts on terms that enable us to achieve the
hedging we need. If interest rates turn negative, our derivative instruments (to the extent we are party to such
instruments) would not achieve our hedging needs. In addition to paying fixed interest payments, a negative
interest rate would increase our interest payment instead of our receiving a floating rate interest payment in return.
Furthermore, our derivative contracts (to the extent we are party to such contracts) may be subject to termination
or break clauses, which may force us to renegotiate or replace those contracts on unattractive terms. Any of these
events could cause losses and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition. Moreover, although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements in the future, there can be no
assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.

**_We may not be successful in achieving our strategic goals._**

We may not be successful in developing and implementing our strategic plans for our businesses. If the
development or implementation of such plans is not successful, we may not produce the revenue, margins,
earnings or synergies that we need to be successful and to offset the impact of adverse economic conditions that
may exist currently or develop in the future. We may also face delays or difficulties in implementing process and
system improvements, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully compete in our core markets. In
addition, the costs associated with implementing such plans may exceed anticipated amounts and we may not
have sufficient financial resources to fund all of the desired or necessary investments required in connection with
our plans, including one-time costs associated with our business consolidation and operating improvement plans.


-----

The existing and future execution of our strategic and operating plans will, to some extent, also be
dependent on external factors that we cannot control, such as regulatory, legislative changes, systemic failures in
our industry or the industry sectors of our clients and changes in fiscal and monetary policies or the economic
environment in our markets. In addition, these strategic and operational plans need to be continually reassessed to
meet the challenges and needs of our businesses in order for us to remain competitive. The failure to implement
and execute our strategic and operating plans in a timely manner or at all or the failure to realize the cost savings
or other benefits or improvements associated with such plans could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_Pending and future tax audits within our Group and changes in fiscal regulations could lead to additional tax_**
**_liabilities._**

We are subject to routine tax audits by local tax authorities. Our UK Division’s tax returns are prepared
in accordance with UK tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions taken by our UK Division
are based on industry practice, tax advice and drawing similarities from our facts and circumstances to those in
case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, value added, franchise, gross receipts,
payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base and apportionment. Challenges made by tax authorities
to our UK Division’s application of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income
or deductions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have an adverse effect
on our financial condition and result of operations.

In addition, we are exposed to potential tax risks related to acquisitions, disposals and reorganizations, if
our position with regard to the tax consequences of the acquisitions, disposals and reorganizations is challenged
in a tax audit. Furthermore, our UK Division’s effective tax rate in a given financial year reflects a variety of
factors that may not be present in the succeeding financial year or years. One such factor affecting this effective
tax rate is the relevant standard rate of corporation tax assessed against our UK Division, which is subject to
change. This rate is currently 19% as of April 2020. In addition, changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretation
of tax laws by the courts or the tax authorities including those tax laws relating to the utilization of tax loss or
credit carry forwards, and changes in our assessment of certain matters, such as the ability to realize deferred tax
assets or claim tax deductions for interest on intragroup loans, may also have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Our DACH Division’s tax audits in Germany have been finalized for corporate income tax
(Körperschaftsteuer), trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) and VAT (Umsatzsteuer) for financial years up to and including
the year ended December 31, 2009 in the case of the DACH Division companies. Ongoing tax audits for the
DACH Division, which comprise, for most DACH Division companies, the period up to and including the
financial year ended December 31, 2016, tax audits for later periods not yet subject to a tax audit or tax audits in
other countries may lead to higher tax assessments in the future. For example, the DACH Division operates a
number of tax groups (Organschaften) in Germany and these tax structures may be challenged in future tax audits.
Non-recognition of our tax groups by the German tax authorities could lead to additional tax liabilities. In
connection with the last tax audits of Tesch, part of the interest on shareholder loans was considered as a
constructive dividend by the tax authorities resulting in an additional suspended corporate income tax, trade tax
and withholding tax of approximately €0.8 million (whereby approximately €0.67 million is covered by a
contractual indemnity claim). This treatment has been challenged by tax appeals and leap-frog actions
(Sprungklagen). An adverse outcome in the tax appeals and proceedings could lead to additional tax liabilities
(including interest) and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations.

**_Recent changes in Luxembourg tax laws may have a material impact on the tax position and results of the_**
**_Issuer._**

As part of its anti-tax avoidance package, the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance
Directive on January 28, 2016, which was formally adopted by the EU Council on July 12, 2016 in Council
Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “ATAD I”). The Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 then amended
the ATAD I with respect to hybrid mismatches with third countries (the “ATAD II”).

On December 21, 2018, Luxembourg enacted a law (the “ATAD I Law”) transposing the ATAD I into
Luxembourg legislation. The ATAD I Law may have an impact on the tax position and the performance of the
Issuer. Amongst the measures contained in the ATAD I Law is an interest deductibility limitation rule. The ATAD
I Law provides that “exceeding borrowing costs” in excess of the higher of (a) €3,000,000 or (b) 30% of an entity’s
adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) will not be deductible in the year
in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward over the five subsequent financial years.


-----

“Exceeding borrowing costs” is a defined term which relates to the amount by which the tax-deductible borrowing
costs exceed “interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues.”

Furthermore, the Luxembourg law dated December 20, 2019 (the “ATAD II Law”) transposed the
ATAD II into Luxembourg legislation. With respect to situations of double deductions or deductions without
inclusion resulting from hybrid mismatches, the ATAD II Law extends the scope of the ATAD I Law to third
countries. The ATAD II requires EU Member States to either deny deduction of payments, expenses or losses or
include payments as taxable income, in case of hybrid mismatches. It includes situations involving permanent
establishments, reverse hybrids, imported mismatches, hybrid transfers and dual residence. The ATAD II Law
applies as of January 1, 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches which will apply as of
January 1, 2022. The exact impact of the ATAD I Law and the ATAD II Law will need to be monitored on a
regular basis, notably in the light of any future guidance from the Luxembourg tax authorities.

**_Due to the forfeiture of loss carry forwards under German tax laws, we may be unable to use loss carry forwards_**
**_to set off future gains._**

Tax loss carry forwards and unused losses of the current financial year are forfeited in full if more than
50% of the subscribed capital, membership rights, participation rights or voting rights in certain of our German
companies are transferred, directly or indirectly, to an acquirer or related parties of such acquirer (or a group of
acquirers with common interests) within a period of five years or of comparable measures (the so-called “harmful
**acquisition”). If and to the extent the tax loss carry forwards and unused losses of the current financial year are**
covered by the built-in gains of the loss-making company’s business assets that are subject to domestic taxation,
a forfeiture of such items would generally not apply.

With respect to the acquisition of Carl Holding GmbH by Lowell Holding GmbH in 2015, we believe
that tax loss carry forwards of Carl Holding GmbH (now merged into Lowell Holding GmbH) will be forfeited,
but tax loss carry forwards of Lowell Holdco GmbH will be protected by the built-in gains clauses and thus remain
available for offsets against future profits. If tax authorities and the tax court do not follow that position and thus
claim for forfeiture of tax loss carry forwards, a deferred tax asset accrued for at the Lowell Holdco GmbH level
with an amount of €7.8 million may be forfeited, thus such forfeiture may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Due to restrictions on the deduction of interest expenses under applicable tax laws, we may be unable to fully_**
**_deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

Interest payments on our debt may not be fully deductible for tax purposes, which could adversely affect
our financial results. Subject to certain prerequisites, the interest barrier rules of different jurisdictions impose
certain restrictions on the deductibility of interest for tax purposes. However, any restrictive interest deduction
limitation rules could have a negative effect on our financial position and result.

**_The VAT treatment of the purchase of non-performing loans performed by us may be challenged or changed_**
**_resulting in additional cash out for VAT._**

A substantial part of the business of our DACH Division is the purchase of portfolios of NPLs. Our
DACH Division collects the receivables for its own account, taking the risk of final payment default. Generally,
the purchase price for NPLs is determined by estimating the value of collectable receivables (“economic nominal
**value”)—which is less than the nominal value of the receivables—less the cost of debt collection and of**
pre-financing and discounted using an appropriate discount rate. In 2003, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”)
decided that the purchase of receivables for a subsequent cash collection (factoring) is to be treated as a supply of
a taxable service from the purchaser to the seller (C-305/01, MKG). The seller would be relieved from the
collection of the receivables as well as from the risk of (final) payment default. The ECJ decision was also adopted
by the German tax authorities for the purchases of NPLs (old version of Section 2.4 para. 1 and para. 8 German
VAT Guidelines, “UStAE”). On October 27, 2011, the ECJ decided that acquisitions of NPLs are not subject to
VAT (C93/10, GFKL). This court decision was adopted by the German Federal Tax Court (“BFH”) in a decision
dated January 26, 2012 (V R 18/08). The BFH decision also said that no input VAT could be claimed on costs
incurred in connection with NPLs acquisitions as well as on costs incurred in connection with the collection of
the receivables, and referred back to the local Tax Court Düsseldorf. Our DACH Division has since withdrawn
its initial lawsuit. Consequently the cases are not binding on our DACH Division. These court cases as well as
another comparable case (BFH decision dated July 4, 2013 (V R 8/10)) have been adopted by the German tax
authorities in a tax decree issued by the German Federal Ministry of Finance dated December 2, 2015 and in
updated VAT Guidelines (Section 2.4 para. 1, para. 7 and para. 8 German VAT Guidelines).


-----

The VAT Guidelines include the possibility to apply for previous guidance from the German tax
authorities with respect to NPLs acquired before July 1, 2016 or, in the case of revolving contracts, before January
1, 2019, i.e., that the purchase of NPLs still qualifies as a VAT-taxable service allowing for the deduction of input
VAT for the respective historical periods. As the DACH Division did not entirely treat the purchases of NPLs as
subject to VAT according to the MKG jurisprudence, in some cases no VAT was collected and paid to the tax
authorities, in the period for the year ended December 31, 2004 to June 30, 2020, the DACH Division shows an
accrual of €5.3 million (including interest).

Any VAT payments could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretation of tax laws by the courts or the
tax authorities may also have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_Failure to register under the U.S. Investment Company Act may result in a material adverse effect on the_**
**_Issuer._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have not been and will not be registered with the SEC as an investment
company pursuant to the U.S. Investment Company Act in reliance on the exemption from registration provided
by Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment Company Act. No action positions are available for non-U.S. obligors
(a) whose outstanding securities owned by U.S. persons are owned exclusively by Qualified Purchasers and (b)
which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States. Accordingly, investors in the Notes
will not be accorded the protections of the U.S. Investment Company Act. Counsel for the Issuer and the
Guarantors will opine, in connection with the sale of the Notes and the Note Guarantees, that none of the Issuer
and the Guarantors is at such time an investment company required to be registered under the U.S. Investment
Company Act (assuming, for the purposes of such opinion, the accuracy and completeness of all representations
and warranties made or deemed to be made by investors in the Notes). No opinion or no-action position has been
requested of the SEC.

If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer or any Guarantor is required,
but has failed, to register in violation of the U.S. Investment Company Act, possible consequences include, but
are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors
could sue the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and recover any damages caused by the violation of the
registration requirement of the U.S. Investment Company Act; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer or the
applicable Guarantor is party that is made in, or whose performance involves a, violation of the U.S. Investment
Company Act would be unenforceable by any party to the contract unless a court were to find that under the
circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be
inconsistent with the purposes of the U.S. Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer or any Guarantor be
subjected to any or all of the foregoing, there would be a material adverse effect on the Issuer or the applicable
Guarantor.

If the Issuer determines that a purchaser of the Notes that is a U.S. person was not a Qualified Purchaser
at the time of its acquisition of the Notes, the Issuer will have the right, at its option, to require such person to
dispose of its Notes to a person or entity that is qualified to hold the Notes immediately upon receipt of a notice
from the Issuer that the relevant purchaser was not a Qualified Purchaser.

**_Terrorist attacks, war and threats of attacks and war may materially and adversely affect consumer spending,_**
**_and in turn, our financial condition, financial returns and results of operation._**

Terrorist attacks in the UK, Germany, Northern Europe and abroad, as well as war and threats of war or
actual conflicts involving the UK, German, Northern Europe or other countries, may dramatically and adversely
impact the economies of the countries in which we operate and cause consumer confidence and spending to
decrease. Any of these occurrences could affect our ability to collect our receivables and result in a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, financial returns and results of operation.

**_The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions,_**
**_financial markets and our business._**

On January 31, 2020, the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (“Brexit”) became effective
and the UK entered into a transition period, currently from January 31, 2020 until at least December 31, 2020
during which the European Union will treat the UK as if it were still a member of the European Union (the
“Transition Period”). If the UK and the European Union are unable to negotiate an acceptable ongoing trade


-----

deal at the end of the Transition Period, this could have an impact on the general and economic conditions in the
UK, which will directly adversely affect the financial condition of our consumers.

As no member state of the EU has previously chosen to leave the EU, the legal and political process for
doing so is untried and uncertain. There are a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the
UK and its relationship with the EU and the negotiation of Brexit-related matters may take several years. Given
this uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes, it is currently impossible to determine the impact that Brexit
and the nature and extent of government responses in the formulation of fiscal and monetary policies, and/or any
related matters may have on general economic conditions in the UK. It is also not possible to determine the impact
that these matters will have on our business. In addition, the instability could be further exacerbated by a push for
independence by Scotland and/or Northern Ireland.

If the UK and the European Union are unable to agree to certain trading and customs terms to become
effective at the end of the Transition Period, the UK could lose its present rights or terms of access to the single
EU market and EU customs areas and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. A
decline in trade between the UK and the EU could also affect the attractiveness of the UK as a global investment
center and, as a result, could have a detrimental impact on the level of investment in the UK, and ultimately, on
the UK’s economic growth.

Should no data adequacy status be conferred on the UK by the European Commission, there could also
be restrictions on the ability to transfer personal consumer data between the UK and the European Union which
could limit our ability to operate in a manner consistent with past practice and increase operating and compliance
costs.

Any reduction in our consumers’ willingness or ability to pay their debts due to Brexit-related changes
in the economic environments of the UK, Germany or Northern Europe could materially affect our revenue and
our ability to perform debt collection in a manner consistent with our past practice. See _“—Changes in the_
_economic environment, in particular in the UK and Germany, may have a material adverse effect on our financial_
_condition, financial returns and results of operations.” In addition, any fundamental shift in the macroeconomic_
environment in the UK or the other parts of Europe in which we operate could adversely affect the accuracy of
our predictions regarding the expected returns from the debt portfolios we purchase and service. See “—The
_statistical models and decision science tools that we use in our business may prove to be inaccurate, we may not_
_achieve anticipated levels of return and we may be unable to appropriately identify and address underperforming_
_portfolios.”_

Lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations as the UK determines which European Union laws
to replace or replicate, including financial laws and regulations, data privacy and collection laws and regulations
and tax and free trade agreements, may increase costs associated with operating in either or both of the UK and
Germany, depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital.

In particular, our UK Division is subject to a number of EU laws and regulations governing its operations,
and uncertainty regarding the future applicability of these regulations may increase our compliance costs.
Additionally, any substantial change in the regulations applicable to our UK business could jeopardize our ability
to continue to operate in a manner consistent with our past practice. See “—We are subject to EU, UK, German
_and Norwegian regulations, among others, and changes to the regulatory environment or a failure to comply with_
_applicable laws, regulations, authorizations, licenses and codes of practice may negatively affect our business—_
_Regulations affecting Our UK Division.”_

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

We are highly leveraged. As of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions
and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we would have had total financial indebtedness of £1,945 million
including indebtedness under the Notes. See “Capitalization.”

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the Transactions could have important consequences
to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

    - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;


-----

    - making us vulnerable to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

    - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund new debt portfolio purchases, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint
ventures or other general corporate purposes;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are
not as highly leveraged; and

    - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, which may_**
**_make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

The terms of the Indenture and the Existing Indentures will permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in respect of committed borrowings of up to €455.0 million
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (which may be further increased in amounts up to the greater of
an additional £500.0 million and 17.5% of the Group’s 84-month ERC or, to the extent exceeded, in amounts
which would otherwise constitute permitted debt under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and additional
Notes by the Issuer. The new debt that we incur in the future, including for example in connection with
acquisitions, may rank pari passu with, be structurally senior to, or be secured by assets that do not form part of
the Collateral for the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Any such additional indebtedness could mature prior to the
Notes.

We may also enter into new qualified receivables financing programs, pursuant to which we would
pledge receivables that either do not form part of the Collateral or would be released from the Collateral in
connection with any such program. Our existing securitization debt is and any future securitization debt would be
structurally senior to the Notes and secured by receivables that either were not part of the Collateral or that were
released from the Collateral in connection with such programs. As of June 30, 2020, we had two securitization
programs outstanding, with total drawn amounts thereunder of £234.1 million and a remaining 84-month ERC for
assets underlying such loans of £602.8 million.

Although the Existing Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain, and the Indenture
will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number
of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that
could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Existing Indentures
and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement do not, and the Indenture will not, prevent us from incurring
obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Furthermore, if we are able to designate
some of our restricted subsidiaries under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture
as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations
specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which Restricted Subsidiaries may not engage. See
“Description of the Notes,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” If new debt is added to our and
our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and capital_**
**_needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

    - create or incur certain liens;


-----

    - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of
such entity;

    - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

    - make certain investments;

    - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to such entity;

    - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

    - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

    - consolidate or merge with other entities; and

    - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of
_the Notes—Certain Covenants.” Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants to which we are_
subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business
opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and to the negative covenants contained in the Existing Indentures, which negative covenants, in both
instances, are substantially similar to the covenants that will be included in the Indenture.

A breach of any of those covenants or the occurrence of certain specified events will, subject to applicable
cure periods and other limitations, result in an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Majority Lenders
(being, subject to certain limitations, lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement whose commitments
thereunder aggregate at least 66[2]/3% of the total commitments thereunder) could, while such event of default
remains unremedied or unwaived, cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and elect to
declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest,
immediately due and payable. In addition, a default or event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain crossdefault or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Existing Indentures and the Indenture. If our creditors,
including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Notes, accelerate the
payment of amounts owing to them under such other debt instruments, we cannot assure you that our assets and
the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of
our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or
in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any security
interests granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other_**
**_actions to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

We have, and after the issuance of the Notes, we will continue to have significant debt service
obligations. Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our
drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility and our obligations under the Existing Notes and the Notes, and to
fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a
certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.”

Our Revolving Credit Facility, as amended by the 2020 Amendment and Restatement Agreement, will
mature on the date falling on the earlier of (i) 57 months after the effective date under the 2020 Amendment and
Restatement Agreement and (ii) three months prior to the earliest originally scheduled final maturity of any Senior
Secured Notes or Senior Notes (as applicable) (each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) then outstanding.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of loans
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and of the obligations under the Existing Notes, the Notes and
any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources


-----

to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, or we are otherwise restricted from doing so due
to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required to refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to
refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be
forced to reduce or delay our business obligations, activities or capital expenditures, sell assets, raise additional
debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial, or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our
debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to accomplish any
of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that those actions would secure sufficient
funds to meet our obligations under our indebtedness.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition
at such time as well as on many factors outside of our control, including then prevailing conditions in the
international credit and capital markets. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our
current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. The terms of existing or future debt
instruments and the Indenture, the Existing Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may restrict
us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on
our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could
harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

In the absence of operating results and resources sufficient to service our indebtedness we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt
service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including the terms of the Indenture, the Existing
Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, will restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and the
use of proceeds from any such disposal. We may not be able to carry out certain disposals or to obtain the funds
that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset
dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures
may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations.

**_Developments concerning the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union could adversely affect our ability_**
**_to service our current debt and our ability to incur indebtedness in the future._**

The value of the pound sterling against the U.S. dollar and the euro declined in the months following the
result of the Brexit referendum and there can be no assurance that further Brexit-related declines in the value of
the pound will not occur in the months or years to come. It is unclear how the withdrawal of the UK from the
European Union will affect the EU single market and other important financial and trade relationships and how
any of these changes will affect us. See “—The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union may have a
_negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.”_

In particular, Brexit-related declines in the value of the pound and related issues could have adverse
consequences for us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations, which could adversely affect our financial
condition. To the extent we rely on our revenue in sterling to service our euro-denominated indebtedness, further
declines in the value of the pound relative to the euro may increase the proportion of revenue we need to devote
to our debt service obligations and adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we report our financial results
for the Group in pound sterling. Accordingly, we must translate our euro-denominated indebtedness into poundequivalent amounts in order to prepare our quarterly and yearly financial reports, and further declines in the value
of the pound relative to the euro may increase the pound sterling-denominated value of the debt we disclose in
these reports. See “Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We are exposed to the risk of currency
_fluctuations.”_

Furthermore, the Existing Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain, and the
Indenture will contain, covenants restricting our and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities. See “—Risks Related
_to Our Financial Profile—We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future_
_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.” Certain of these covenants_
impose limitations in amounts denominated in pound sterling, including the covenant limiting the amount of
additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur. If future debt is incurred in a currency other than pound
sterling for purposes other than refinancing, the Indenture will require, for the purpose of determining compliance
with these restrictions, that we convert the principal amount of such debt into a pound sterling equivalent value
based upon the relevant exchange rate then in effect. As such, if the pound sterling were to continue to decrease
in value, the amount of debt we could incur under these restrictions would effectively decrease for all debt
denominated in a currency other than pound sterling, and such limitations on our ability to incur additional debt
in euro and other currencies may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations and conduct our day-today business.


-----

**_Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies_**
**_within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could have adverse consequences for us_**
**_with respect to our outstanding euro-denominated debt obligations._**

Financial markets and the supply of credit may continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing fears
surrounding the sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe (primarily Greece, Italy and
Spain), the possibility of further downgrading of, or defaults on, sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in
growth in certain economies and uncertainties regarding the overall stability of the euro and the sustainability of
the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States.
Governments and regulators have implemented austerity programs and other remedial measures to respond to this
issue and stabilize the financial system, but the actual impact of such programs and measures are difficult to
predict.

If the Eurozone debt crisis is not resolved, it is possible that one or more countries may default on their
debt obligations and/or cease using the euro and re-establish their own national currency or that the Eurozone may
collapse. If such an event were to occur, it is possible that there would be significant, extended and generalized
market dislocation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition, especially as our operations are primarily in Europe. In addition, the departure of one or more countries
from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of, inter alia, exchange rate

control laws.

Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro such as supply
contracts would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions
concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect our trading environment and the value of the Notes,
and could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding euro-denominated debt obligations,
which could adversely affect our financial condition.

Furthermore, the Existing Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain, and the
Indenture will contain, covenants restricting our and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities. See “—Risks Related
_to Our Financial Profile—We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future_
_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.” Certain such covenants impose_
limitations based on euro amounts (e.g., the amount of additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur).
As such, if the euro were to significantly decrease in value, the restrictions imposed by these covenants would
become tighter, further restricting our ability to finance our operations and conduct our day-to-day business.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral and other distressed disposals._**

On or about the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis
by the same Collateral securing the obligations under (i) the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any
outstanding hedging liabilities that are permitted to be secured by such Collateral, on a super priority basis and
(ii) the Existing Senior Secured Notes, on a pari passu basis. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we
will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the
same Collateral on a pari passu or on a super priority basis with the Notes.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
providers of certain additional super senior indebtedness, certain hedging obligations, the Security Agent, any
receiver and certain creditor representatives, including the Trustee, are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of
the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale and all amounts received by the Security Agent pursuant to the turnover
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the
Collateral or any other distressed disposal, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the aggregate of the
then outstanding claims under super senior indebtedness are greater than or equal to the proceeds realized. Any
proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor and all amounts received by the Security
Agent pursuant to the turnover provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will, after all obligations under super
senior indebtedness have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Existing
Senior Secured Notes, any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with
the Notes and certain non-priority hedging obligations.


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, which will also serve as the
security agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the hedging obligations which are
permitted to be secured on the Collateral, the holders of the Existing Notes, the holders of the Notes and the
creditors of any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement
and the security documents. The Intercreditor Agreement also regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders
of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take
enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group (as defined below under—”Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises (i) creditors holding in aggregate_
more than 66[2]/3% of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the aggregate
commitments under any super senior Credit Facility and the aggregate of hedging exposures under certain priority
hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and (ii) creditors holding in aggregate more than
50% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the outstanding
principal amount of any indebtedness ranking _pari passu with the Notes (the “Majority Senior Secured_
**Creditors”) (in each case, except for any hedge counterparties, acting through their respective creditor**
representative). If, however, before the discharge of all super senior obligations, the Security Agent has received
conflicting enforcement instructions from the creditor representatives (and for these purposes, silence is deemed
to be a conflicting instruction) then, to the extent the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to
the extent given) comply with the initial consultation requirements and the security enforcement principles set
forth in the Intercreditor Agreement (one of which states that the primary and overriding objective of an
enforcement of security over the Collateral is the maximization, so far as is consistent with prompt and expeditious
realization of value, of recoveries by the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (each as defined
below under—”Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”)), the Security Agent
will comply with the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if the super senior
liabilities have not been fully discharged within six months, or no enforcement action has occurred within three
months of the date on which the first such enforcement instructions were issued, then the instructions of the
Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a
_pari passu basis with the Notes and the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the voting interest of the holders of the_
Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurately with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

The lenders under our super senior indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interests
of holders of the Notes and the Existing Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies in respect of the Collateral at a time when it would be
disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes and the Existing Senior Secured Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer, the shares of any
holding company (in the case of any future grant of share security at such levels) or the shares of any subsidiary
of the Issuer as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, against, and the liens over any other
assets of, such entities and any subsidiaries of such entity securing the Notes and Note Guarantees may be released.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” “Description of the Notes—
_The Note Guarantees—Note Guarantees Release” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_Claims of our super senior creditors will have priority with respect to their security over the claims of holders_**
**_of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness._**

Claims of our super senior creditors will have priority with respect to the assets securing their
indebtedness over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, each Note Guarantee will be effectively
subordinated to any super senior indebtedness (including obligations with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility
and certain hedging obligations) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In the event
of any enforcement over Collateral that secures the Notes and pursuant to certain other turnover provisions under
the Intercreditor Agreement, holders of super senior indebtedness will have prior claims to such Collateral.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, if, for any reason, obligations owed to any super senior
and senior secured creditors remain unpaid after enforcement of the Collateral and the resulting losses are not
borne by the super senior creditors and the senior secured creditors in the proportion corresponding to the total
liabilities owed to the super senior creditors and the senior secured creditors, respectively, then the applicable
creditors will be required to make payments among themselves to achieve the appropriate proportion in
accordance with the order of priority contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, the holders of the
Notes, together with the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and any creditors under any other Senior


-----

Secured Debt, on a collective basis, may need to make payments to the super senior creditors to rectify any
disproportionate recovery in an enforcement scenario.

The Collateral remaining after repayment of all super senior indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay
all amounts owing in respect of any applicable Note Guarantee. To the extent that the Notes are not repaid in full
from the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, the holders of the Notes will participate
ratably with all holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, creditors of other indebtedness that is permitted to
rank pari passu with the Notes, creditors of any indebtedness ranking junior to the Notes, and potentially with all
other general creditors, depending upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in the remaining
assets of the relevant Guarantor.

As of the Issue Date, we expect we will have the equivalent if £     million drawn under the Revolving
Credit Facility. We may also enter into further hedging obligations or other indebtedness entitled to be repaid in
priority to the Notes, or issue further indebtedness which will be entitled to rank pari passu with the Notes in right
and priority of payment and which will be entitled to share in the Collateral with the Notes on a pari passu basis.
In the event that any such debt is further issued, the creditor voting rights of the holders of the Notes will be
diluted proportionately to the amount of indebtedness incurred which will be entitled to rank pari passu with the
Notes.

**_The ability of holders of the Notes to recover under the Collateral may be limited._**

The Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise,
we cannot assure the holders of the Notes that there will be a market for the Collateral or that, if such market does
exist, there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. The shares of the Issuer and its Guarantors may also
have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding in relation to the Issuer or
any of its Guarantors because all of the obligations of such Issuer or Guarantor (subject to the release mechanism
in the Intercreditor Agreement) must be satisfied prior to distribution to such entity’s equity holders. As a result,
the holders of the Notes may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement of the pledges of the
shares in the Issuer or the Guarantors. In addition, the value of this Collateral may fluctuate over time.

Furthermore, each security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be
limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. See “Risks
_Related to Our Structure and the Financing—Each Note Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its_
_validity and enforceability.”_

Additionally, holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral that is also pledged as
security for any super senior indebtedness because the creditors in respect thereof will have a prior right to
recovery on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Collateral and any distressed disposal with respect
to such Collateral, and the holders of the Notes will need to share any remaining proceeds from such enforcement
with any other secured creditor ranking pari passu with the Notes. See “—Holders of the Notes will not control
_certain decisions regarding the Collateral and other distressed disposals” and “—Claims of our super senior_
_creditors will have priority with respect to their security over the claims of holders of the Notes, to the extent of_
_the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.”_

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

On or about the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by security interests in
the Collateral described in this Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indentures and certain hedging obligations, if any. Upon a
refinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, or if the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement consent to an increase of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, or if we
exercise our right to incur additional priority hedging arrangements, the amount that will benefit from super-senior
interests in the Collateral may be increased, subject to the limits imposed under the Indenture. The Collateral may
also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes (including non-priority hedging arrangements) to
the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of
the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the super-priority debt secured by the
Collateral, an increase in obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, or a reduction of the Collateral
securing the Notes.


-----

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the
condition of the economies in which our operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of
the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the
Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you
that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a
substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the share pledges over the shares of an entity may be of no value
if the applicable entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. Furthermore, certain of our contracts
include a change of control clause, which may be triggered by the enforcement of Collateral and may limit the
value of the Collateral. The Collateral is located in Germany, England and Wales, Jersey, Luxembourg, Finland
and any other jurisdiction applicable to any future collateral. The multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on
the Collateral may limit the realizable value of such Collateral. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency,
administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with, each
other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain
post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of_**
**_permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the_**
**_granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the_**
**_laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees may create hardening
periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions (subject, for Luxembourg, to the provisions of the
Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005, as amended, concerning financial collateral arrangements (the “Financial
**Collateral Law 2005”)). See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the**
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The granting of shared security interests to secure future_
indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods, in particular
as the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances,
including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness, the transfer of Collateral within the Group and
the implementation of certain corporate reorganizations. The applicable hardening period for these new security
interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected.

In each case, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be
possible to enforce it. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The same rights will apply following the issuance of the_
Notes in connection with the accession of any other subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of
security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of noteholders. Please see
“Description of the Notes—Security.”

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Note Guarantees_**
**_and the Collateral securing the Notes and Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent_**
**_or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, (i) the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be
released automatically, including sales of accounts receivable of our UK Division to third parties in connection
with the establishment of a qualified receivables financing, such as the Luigi Securitization, and in connection
with certain corporate reorganizations, and (ii) the Note Guarantees may be released automatically, including sales
to third parties and in connection with certain corporate reorganizations. See “Description of the Notes—The Note
_Guarantees—Releases” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

Additionally, even though the holders of the Notes and the Existing Senior Secured Notes will share in
the Collateral securing the Notes and the Existing Senior Secured Notes with the creditors under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will receive the proceeds
of the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the holders of the Notes and, under certain circumstances, the
creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain of our hedging arrangements will control
enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral through the Security Agent, whether or not the holders of the
Notes agree with those actions. See “—Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the
_Collateral and other distressed disposals” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Enforcement of Security_
_Interests.”_


-----

In addition, the Note Guarantees and security interests will be subject to release upon a distressed disposal
as contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes.”_

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other
creditors that have the benefit of first-priority security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to
time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes,
as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of
security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of
perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests granted in favor of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems
generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral in certain jurisdictions. For example,
under Luxembourg and German law, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an
appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent
of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain
any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required
to facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure on, such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to
sell or foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

Furthermore, T-Shares in certain of our subsidiaries are held by Garfunkelux PBA S.à r.l., which is not
a subsidiary of the Issuer or the Parent. To obtain control of 100% of the share capital of or instruments issued by
entities that have transferred or issued T-Shares to Garfunkelux PBA S.à r.l., the Security Agent would be required
to enforce such pledges of T-Shares separately from the pledges provided by the Issuer over the shares of Lowell
Holding GmbH and Simon Holdco Limited, which are the direct and indirect parent entities of the remaining
Group entities. Likewise, the Security Agent would be required to enforce the pledge over Garfunkelux PBA S.à
r.l.’s T-Share in the Issuer separately from the pledge provided by the Parent over its shares in the Issuer.
Enforcement of multiple security documents could cause delays, increase costs and hinder the holders of the
Notes’ ability to derive full benefit from the applicable Collateral.

In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the
operation of the business or the sale of particular assets, including for example the sale of accounts receivable into
a securitization program, could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local_**
**_law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations
of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be
granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement)
that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the security documents. As a consequence, holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

The granting of security interests in favor of a foreign security agent (acting for and on behalf of thirdparty beneficiaries) will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the designation of such
security agent is valid under the law governing its appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending
on the type of the security interests granted. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Financial Collateral Law
2005, a security interest which constitutes a financial collateral arrangement (in accordance with the provisions
of the Financial Collateral Law 2005) may be provided in favor of a person acting for and on behalf of the
beneficiary(ies) of such security interest(s), a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party
beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be
determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third-party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting
on behalf of beneficiaries of the security interest(s), the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as
those of the direct beneficiaries of the security interest(s) provided under the Financial Collateral Law 2005.


-----

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject
to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken.
For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but
require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under
the laws of certain jurisdictions, as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified
as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including, among
others, Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests and enforceability of such security interests, the applicable Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel
debt” obligation (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the
Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt
structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid
existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under
the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The
parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the
Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel
debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to
the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the
parallel debt structure has not been tested in the courts of these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no
judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral
may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the
part of the Security Agent.

In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of
the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement,
diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Note Guarantees.

Finally, the provision of Note Guarantees and execution of the Collateral will be subject to certain agreed
security principles that could relieve certain Guarantors or security providers of the obligation to provide
guarantees and/or grant security interests in assets otherwise expected to form part of the Collateral, which could
have a material adverse impact on the credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the
Notes.

**_You may face interest rate risks by investing in the Notes, as certain of our borrowings bear, and the Floating_**
**_Rate Euro Notes will bear, interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost_**
**_and reducing cash flow._**

A substantial part of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Existing Hansa Notes and the Floating Rate Euro Notes, bears or will bear interest at per annum rates equal to
EURIBOR (subject to a 0.0% floor), in each case adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could
rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing
cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these
rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.
Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to
terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense
would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

**_The EURIBOR or LIBOR benchmark may discontinue after 2021, which may make it more difficult to_**
**_administer a benchmark rate and increase our interest expense on our debt linked to such benchmarks and_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and return on, the Floating Rate Euro Notes._**

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and
law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations
into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation
of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR,
EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are
the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO
Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as
benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds,


-----

which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of
administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For
example, on July 27, 2017, the FCA announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates
for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement
and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale Policy at the FCA on January 28, 2019 indicate
that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis (or at all) cannot and will not be guaranteed, and market
participants should not rely on its publication, after 2021. In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England
and the FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended
mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”) across sterling
bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark
by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the working group
will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of SONIA reference rates. A public
consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries related to the operations of SONIA reference
rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms
as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting
the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit
LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely,
to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives
for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences
which cannot be predicted.

The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of
administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to
the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and
conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not
limited to the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Hansa Notes and the Floating Rate Euro Notes, interest rates
of which are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). The discontinuation of EURIBOR or LIBOR or changes to its
administration could require changes to the way in which the interest payments on the Floating Rate Euro Notes
are calculated. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden
or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to
service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. Any such consequence could have a material adverse
effect on the value of, and return on, the Floating Rate Euro Notes. In addition, the development of alternatives to
EURIBOR or LIBOR may result in the Floating Rate Euro Notes performing differently than would otherwise
have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR had not developed.

The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or
administered, the Issuer could, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, determine an appropriate
successor rate, and make certain adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to make such
successor rate comparable to EURIBOR, which upon certification (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) by the
Issuer of such rate to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent will be used to calculate
the interest rate in relation to the Floating Rate Euro Notes (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation,
verification or liability of any kind whatsoever) without any further action or consent by the noteholders or the
Trustee. This means that interest on the Floating Rate Euro Notes would be determined on the basis of a
benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Floating Rate
Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” The
Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments
(including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the
consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may
be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes.

In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the
involvement of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as
intended at the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of
administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt.
Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate
debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will
be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.


-----

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they_**
**_may be sold._**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to register
the Notes or the Note Guarantees under, the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction
and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable laws. The Issuer and
the Guarantors have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act, in reliance on
the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(7) thereof. No sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the
Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require the Issuer or any of its officers or directors to
register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the U.S. Investment Company Act or any other similar
legislation or regulatory action. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to
register the Notes or the Note Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry
interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depository (or its nominee) for Euroclear
and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments of principal, interest and other
amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to Citibank, N.A.,
London Branch, as Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these
payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing
the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or
other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes,
you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations as a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights
to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead,
if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate
proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance
that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any
matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the applicable
definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you
will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

    - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Notes; or

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices
of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a
general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices.
The trading market for Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may


-----

trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a
negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result,
there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops,
you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of The Exchange, we
cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_The Floating Rate Euro Notes and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating_**
**_rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The Floating Rate Euro Notes and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will, and future
indebtedness that we may incur could, bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR,
plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into certain hedging
arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or
continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were
to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

**_The Volcker Rule may negatively affect the liquidity and the value of the Notes._**

The Issuer will likely be a “covered fund” as defined under Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (together with the rules, regulations and published guidance thereunder, as amended (the
“Volcker Rule”). The definition of “covered fund” in the Volcker Rule includes, among other things, any entity
that would be an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act but for the exclusion provided
under Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer and each of the Guarantors relies on Section 3(c)(7)
of the U.S. Investment Company Act for their exclusion from registration thereunder (which limits sales of the
Notes to “qualified purchasers” as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act), they will be
considered “covered funds” for purposes of the Volcker Rule in the absence of an exclusion from the definition
of “covered fund.” Accordingly, “banking entities” (as defined under the Volcker Rule) that are subject to the
Volcker Rule may be prohibited under the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an
“ownership interest” in the Issuer or any of the Guarantors as a “covered fund,” in the absence of an applicable
exclusion from the definition of “covered fund” or exemption under the Volcker Rule. Depending on market
conditions, this could significantly and negatively affect the liquidity and market value of the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

“Ownership interest” is broadly defined under the Volcker Rule to include any equity, partnership or
other similar interest, and the phrase “other similar interest” is further defined to include, in part, any participation
or other interest that entitles the holder of such interest to, amongst other things: (a) participate in the selection or
removal of management or otherwise (other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of default or
acceleration event and to participate in the removal of an investment manager for “cause” (as defined therein) or
in the selection of a replacement manager upon an investment manager’s resignation or removal), (b) share in the
income, gains or profits of the “covered fund”, (c) receive underlying assets of the “covered fund” after all other
interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of
default or acceleration event), (d) receive all or a portion of excess spread (as defined therein), (e) provide under
the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the “covered fund with respect to the interest can be reduced
based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the “covered fund”, (f) receive income on a pass-through
basis from the “covered fund” or have a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the
underlying assets of the “covered fund”, or (g) any synthetic right to have, receive or be allocated any of the rights
in clauses (a) through (f) above.

On June 25, 2020, the relevant federal regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker
Rule released a final rule to amend certain parts of the Volcker Rule’s covered fund related restrictions. The
changes are intended to improve and streamline certain aspects of the “covered funds” portion of the Volcker
Rule, including by, among other aspects, making modifications to certain existing exclusions from the definition
of “covered fund,” creating certain new exclusions from the definition of “covered fund,” and making certain
clarifications to the definition of “ownership interest.” The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020.


-----

The Volcker Rule may restrict or discourage the acquisition of Notes and the Note Guarantees by “banking
entities” and may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Each purchaser of the Notes
must make its own determination as to whether it is a “banking entity” subject to the Volcker Rule and, if
applicable, the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on its ability to purchase or retain any such Notes. Investors
in the Notes and the Note Guarantees are responsible for analysing their own regulatory position and any liquidity
in connection therewith and on its portfolio generally, and should consult with their own counsel as to the potential
consequences of the Volcker Rule before making an investment decision. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors,
the Initial Purchasers, the Security Agent, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation
to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes and the Note Guarantees regarding the treatment of the Issuer
or any of the Guarantors under the Volcker Rule, or to such investor’s investment in the Notes and the Note
Guarantees on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.

**_Ownership in respect of the Notes will be in registered form._**

The Registrar will keep a register in respect of the Notes in which the Registrar will enter the names and
addresses of the holders of the Notes, the particulars of the Notes held by such holders and all transfers and
redemptions of such Notes (the “Register”).

An additional register will be kept by the Issuer at its registered office (the “Issuer Register”) in
accordance with article 470-1 of the Luxembourg Law of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended
(the “Companies Law 1915”) referring to article 430-4 of the Companies Law 1915. Ownership in respect of
shares (and by extension also debt securities, such as the Notes) which are issued by a Luxembourg company in
registered form is, according to the Companies Law 1915, established by the relevant registration (inscription) in
the register thereof kept at the relevant Luxembourg company’s registered office—in this instance, the Issuer
Register. The Registrar will undertake, pursuant to the Indenture, to notify the Issuer forthwith of any changes
made to the Register to enable it to update its Issuer Register. Accordingly, the registrations in the Register should,
in principle, match the recordings in the Issuer Register. However, there may be a delay in updating an Issuer
Register and discrepancies in recordings may arise. In the event of inconsistency between the Register and the
Issuer Register, the Issuer Register shall prevail for the purposes of Luxembourg law (in the absence of manifest
error).

The Indenture will provide that, in the case of inconsistencies between the Issuer Register and the
Register, the Issuer Register shall prevail. See _“Description of the Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest—_
_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.” It is generally held that the registrations made in the Issuer Register_
would constitute a means to prove ownership in respect of the Notes. However, Luxembourg case law appears to
admit that such registrations in the Issuer Register do not create an irrebuttable presumption (présomption
_irréfragable) of title to the Notes and indicates that other forms of evidence (such as the registrations made in the_
Register) could potentially also serve as means to prove ownership. As a result, there can be no assurance that, in
the event of discrepancies between the Register and the Issuer Register, a Luxembourg court will not take into
account the Register and its contents if the question of the ownership of the Notes is brought before it and rule
that the Register prevails over the Issuer Register. Certificates representing the Notes in registered form may be
issued but they do not confer title to the Notes. Such certificates would also, in principle, not constitute conclusive
evidence to prove ownership in respect of the Notes.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the event that the Sterling
Notes, the Floating Rate Euro Notes or the Fixed Rate Euro Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders (as defined
under “Taxation—Certain _U.S._ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_ _Considerations”) of such series of Notes issued with OID_
generally will be required to include such OID in their gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis
under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. As a result, such U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of
cash payments attributable to such income. See “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—
_Original Issue Discount.”_

**Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing**

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the_**
**_Notes and Note Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than
investments in its subsidiaries. As a result, the Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its
subsidiaries to meet its obligations. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the obligations on
the Notes through a combination of dividends and interest payments on intragroup loans and loan notes. The
obligations under intragroup loans and loan notes will be junior obligations and will be subordinated in right of
payment to all existing and future senior and senior subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, including obligations
under, or guarantees of obligations under, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Notes and the
Notes.

The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and
cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law. The
subsidiaries of the Issuer, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make
distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments on its indebtedness, including the Notes
and the Note Guarantees.

Interest under the Notes may be serviced in part through drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, to the extent sufficient cash is not available from the operations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries. However,
our ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is subject to our compliance with leverage
thresholds or other financial or contractual requirements. In addition, the restrictions in the Existing Indentures
and the Indenture may restrict our ability to incur indebtedness to service interest payments.

Additionally, various agreements governing our debt may restrict, and in some cases, may actually
prevent the ability of the subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Such restrictions include those
created by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement,
which limit payments of principal on the Notes prior to their stated maturity. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation_
while other applicable law may limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as
dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that,
even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be
permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their
restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

**_The Notes and each of the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference_**
**_shares (if any) of non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of
preference shareholders (if any) of such subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
such subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under
the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their
claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent
entity. As such, the Notes and each Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including
trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer or Guarantor.

**_The interests of a Principal Shareholder may conflict with the interests of the holders of Notes._**

The interests of a Principal Shareholder may, in certain circumstances, conflict with your interests as a
holder of Notes. Permira Funds and its affiliates control the Issuer and the Parent. As a result, it has, and will
continue to have, the power, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day
operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our
operations. A Principal Shareholder may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or
other transactions that, in its judgment, will enhance its equity investments, although such transactions might


-----

involve risks to you as a holder of Notes. For example, a Principal Shareholder could vote to cause us to incur
additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or pay dividends, in each case so long as the Indenture and
the Existing Indentures so permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase our debt service
obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate sales, each of which could adversely
affect you as a holder of Notes. In addition, a Principal Shareholder may, in the future, own businesses that directly
compete with ours or do business with us.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under certain applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, only through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor
of the security. The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of
these security interests. In addition, certain applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after
the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain
proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and
identified. Absent perfection, the Security Agent, on behalf of the respective holders of the Notes, may have
difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition with third parties,
including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors that claim a security interest in the same Collateral. See
_“Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations—Luxembourg” and “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany.”_

**_Each Note Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_**
**_limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Note Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant
Guarantor. In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security
under the relevant security documents. However, each security interest granted under a security document will be
limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest and the Indenture
will provide that each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the
relevant Guarantor, without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee/security interest voidable or otherwise
ineffective under German, Luxembourg, English, Jersey, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish or other applicable law or
without resulting in a breach of any applicable law, and enforcement of each Note Guarantee and security
document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that
relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other
laws, guarantees and security interests can be challenged (by the bankruptcy receiver or trustee, in case of
bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor outside bankruptcy), and a
court could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal
act performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Note Guarantees or the
security interests granted under the security documents, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”) and, if payment had_
already been made under a Note Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a security document, require
that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if
the court found, inter alia, that:

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under
the relevant security document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable
law;

    - the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a security document was incurred with
actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain
jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it
granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest;

    - under Luxembourg law, the relevant act was performed (e.g., the Note Guarantees and/or the
security interests under the security documents were granted) with the intention to defraud the


-----

creditors of, and prejudice their means of recovery against, the Guarantor, and where the
recipient/beneficiary and the Guarantor were aware or should have been aware (at the time of
performance of the legal act in question) that the granting by the Guarantor of the relevant Note
Guarantee or security interests would prejudice the means of recovery of one or more (present or
future) creditors of the Guarantor, unless the act was entered into without any consideration, in
which case knowledge by the counterparty is not necessary for a challenge on grounds of
fraudulent conveyance;

    - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the
relevant Note Guarantee or security interests and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or
became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security document; or (iii)
intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at
maturity; and/or

    - the relevant Note Guarantees or security documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of
the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or
security provider.

In addition, under German law, inter alia, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal
Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff)
(i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for
it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Note
Guarantee or security interest granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the
amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero.

Furthermore, the payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves
available to satisfy the obligations under the Note Guarantees and security documents. There can be no assurances
that we will have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Note Guarantees
and security documents, whether or not we pay dividends. In addition, the payment under the Note Guarantees
and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant security documents may require certain prior corporate
formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and
board resolutions. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Enforcement of the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral is governed by the laws of Luxembourg, Germany, England and Wales, Jersey, Finland,
Denmark, Norway and Sweden and any jurisdiction applicable to any future Collateral. In the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights under the
Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively
enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty
and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions
could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce
the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. A summary description of
certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Luxembourg, Germany, England and Wales, Jersey, Denmark, Finland,
Norway and Sweden is set out in “Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees
_and Security Interests and Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The insolvency laws of Germany, Luxembourg, England and Wales, Jersey, Finland, Denmark, Norway,_**
**_Sweden and other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude_**
**_holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are incorporated under the
laws of Luxembourg, Germany, England and Wales, Jersey, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. In the event
of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Germany, Luxembourg, England
and Wales, Jersey, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden or another relevant jurisdiction. The bankruptcy,
insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization or
incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States,


-----

including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain postpetition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could
call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Notes and the Note Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may
receive. See “Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security
_Interests” with respect to the jurisdictions mentioned above._

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture and the Existing_**
**_Indentures._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer would be required
to offer to repurchase all of its outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a change of control
were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would
have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the
restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indentures, the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A
change of control may result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to make an offer to
purchase the Existing Notes or mandatorily prepay the Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. The
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change
of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to
the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing
financial resources (see “—The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet
_its obligations under the Notes and Note Guarantees.”) If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a_
time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we
may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained,
the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require thirdparty financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control but we cannot assure you that
we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase its Notes would constitute
a default under the applicable indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_In certain circumstances, a Change of Control Offer will not be required to be made._**

The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar
transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in
voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” or “Change
of Control Triggering Event” as defined in the Indenture. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Change_ _of_ _Control” for_
additional information. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture
will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition
of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty
as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets
and their restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control
has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro and pound sterling. If investors measure their
investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro or pound sterling an investment in the Notes will
entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
euro or pound sterling relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their
investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the
euro or pound sterling against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments


-----

could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss
to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors
measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S.
dollars by U.S. holders (as defined under “Taxation—Certain _U.S._ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_ _Considerations”) may_
also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See _“Taxation—_
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Parent, the Issuer, each of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized or
incorporated outside of the United States, and our business is conducted entirely outside of the United States. The
directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are all non-residents of the United
States, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although we and the Guarantors
will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities
laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and
executive officers. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective
subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may
be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of decisions of the
U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters
with Germany, Luxembourg, England and Wales, Jersey, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway. There is,
therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Germany, Luxembourg, England and Wales, Jersey, Denmark, Finland,
Sweden and Norway of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In
addition, the enforcement in Germany, Luxembourg, England and Wales, Jersey, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and
Norway of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in Germany, Luxembourg, England and
Wales, Jersey, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway would have the requisite power or authority to grant
remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations.
See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein
and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the
future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by
one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings
and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**SELECTED GROUP CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_The following tables present the Group’s selected historical consolidated financial data as of and for the_
_years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 and should be_
_read in conjunction with the Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which are reproduced elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum, and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Where financial data in the following tables is labeled_
_“audited,” this means that it has been taken from the Audited Group Consolidated Financial Statements_
_mentioned above. The label “unaudited” is used in the following tables to indicate financial data that has not_
_been taken from the Audited Group Consolidated Financial Statements but rather was taken from the Unaudited_
_Group Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or the Issuer’s internal reporting system, or has_
_been calculated based on figures from these sources, as applicable. The information below is not necessarily_
_indicative of the results of future operations._

_The income statement figures for the year ended_ _December 31, 2017 included in the following tables are_
_derived from the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements where the prior year comparative figures as of_
_and for the year ended December 31, 2017 were retrospectively adjusted to reclassify net portfolio write-up under_
_income for consistency with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2018 following the adoption of_
_IFRS 9. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies—_
_Reclassification of prior year presentation” to the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements._

_On March 20, 2018, we acquired Lowell Sverige (formerly Lindorff Sverige) and Lowell AS (formerly_
_Fair Pay Please) (together with their respective subsidiaries), and their results have been consolidated with the_
_Group’s beginning April 1, 2018. As a result, the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 are not_
_directly comparable to those for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2019._

_The selected financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was derived by adding the_
_condensed consolidated interim financial information of the Parent for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to the_
_consolidated financial information of the Parent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and then subtracting the_
_consolidated interim financial information of the Parent for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This twelve-_
_month data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary_
_course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. The financial_
_information for the six months or twelve months ended June 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results_
_that may be expected for any future period, including the year ending December 31, 2020, and should not be used_
_as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation._

_The historical data or unaudited pro forma financial information below is not necessarily indicative of_
_results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,”_
_“Selected Group Consolidated Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s_

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE GROUP’S FINANCIAL CONDITION**

**AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following information should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial and_
_operating data and the Group Consolidated Financial Statements along with the notes included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum. The label “unaudited” is used in the following tables to indicate financial data that has_
_not been taken from the Audited Group Consolidated Financial Statements but rather was taken from the_
_Unaudited Group Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or the Issuer’s internal reporting_
_system, or has been calculated based on figures from these sources, as applicable. The information below is not_
_necessarily indicative of our future results of operations. The following discussion contains forward-looking_
_statements that reflect our plans and estimates and our beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from_
_those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences_
_include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum particularly_
_in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

_The income statement figures for the year ended December 31, 2017 are derived from the 2018 Group_
_Consolidated Financial Statements where the prior year comparative figures as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2017 were retrospectively adjusted to reclassify net portfolio write-up under income for consistency_
_with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2018 following the adoption of IFRS 9. See “Presentation_
_of Financial and Other Information” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies—Reclassification of prior year_
_presentation” to the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements._

_The summary financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was derived by adding_
_the condensed consolidated interim financial information of the Parent for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to_
_the consolidated financial information of the Parent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and then subtracting_
_the consolidated interim financial information of the Parent for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This twelve-_
_month data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary_
_course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. The financial_
_information for the six months or twelve months ended June 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results_
_that may be expected for any future period, including the year ending December 31, 2020, and should not be used_
_as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation._

_We present below certain non-IFRS measures and ratios that are not required by or presented in_
_accordance with IFRS, including Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA and ERC, among others. There can be no_
_assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar_
_items will not be incurred in the future. The non-IFRS measures are not measurements of financial performance_
_under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash_
_flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS measures as_
_presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures_
_used by other companies and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA may differ from “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined_
_in the “Description of the Notes” section of this Offering Memorandum, the Indenture or the Existing Indentures._
_The calculations for the non-IFRS measures are based on various assumptions. This information is inherently_
_subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or_
_results of operations for the periods presented and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision._
_See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”_

_The historical data below should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,”_
_“Selected Group Consolidated Financial Information,” and the financial statements of the Group along with, in_
_each case, the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

_As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the near-, medium- or long-term impact of COVID-19 on_
_our business and our industry remains uncertain due to numerous evolving factors that we are unable to predict._
_See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business and results of operations may be_
_adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.” As such, our historical financial_
_condition and results of operations as of or for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of the results_
_that may be expected for any future period._

**Overview**

The Group is one of the largest Credit Management Services (“CMS”) providers in Europe, by revenue
and ERC in the debt purchasing business and by third-party debt under management in the third-party collection


-----

services business. We believe that the business benefits from scale and diversification in terms of broad geographic
reach and balanced revenue mix, together with a complementary and client-focused product offering.
Furthermore, our expertise, management and financial resources provide the Group with excellent opportunities
to drive further growth and diversification in a highly developed, data-rich credit market. These growth prospects
are supported by our clear core competencies: (i) longstanding and multifaceted client relationships built on
differentiated strategies for originating new business; (ii) a broad business model that is diversified across product
offerings, markets and sectors; (iii) a strong track record of return on capital and reliable portfolio pricing; (iv)
strong cash-generation capability featuring high predictability and visibility into future cash flows; and (v) a robust
and improving governance framework with a focus on reputation and compliance that we believe is embedded in
our operational activity.

We provide a range of credit management services across the UK, DACH (collectively, Germany,
Austria and Switzerland) and Northern Europe (collectively, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) to a broad
client base that includes some of the largest credit providers in Europe. The principal activity of the Group is: the
acquisition and collection of non-performing, generally unsecured, consumer debt portfolios (“DP”); and the
provision of third party contingent collection (“3PC”) services. 3PC services include debt servicing offerings such
as early stage collections, business process outsourcing, contingent collections, trace services and litigation
activities. We operate 3PC services primarily in Germany, Austria and Northern Europe. The Group is very well
regarded within the industry, a reputation that is further supported by the Group’s key strategic themes of strong
customer focus and risk management. Best practices relating to our sophisticated pricing, decision science and
cost-optimization experience are continuously shared across our business and make the Group a trusted partner to
credit originators and consumers alike.

Our Group generated total income of £746.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £657.1
million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated
operating profit of £150.5 million, Group cash income of £949.6 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of
£496.0 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated operating profit of £112.0 million,
Group cash income of £930.3 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of £512.7 million (£280.9 million in
our UK Division, £101.4 million in our DACH Division and £133.2 million in our Northern European Division,
net of £2.7 million of Group costs). As of June 30, 2020, our Gross Money Multiple was 2.6x in the UK Division,
3.2x in the DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division and we had £13.2 billion (as of December
31, 2019: £12.4 billion) of third-party debt under management.

We believe that we are a more diversified business than ever before, with a scaled pan-European presence
and a range of services on offer that compares favorably to peers. Our ability to provide a full range of services
across the CMS value chain helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectable data,
which in turn supports the development of tailored collection strategies and analytical capabilities to more
accurately price portfolios. Operating with a balanced business model across Europe also enables us to allocate
resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the opportunities that are most attractive. Furthermore, the
acquisition of the Northern European Division in 2018 has enabled the Group to provide clients with an enhanced
range of value-added services before loans and receivables are overdue. These include invoicing, in which the
client can outsource its CMS to the Northern European Division, and ability to offer consumers payment through
invoice or part payment solutions and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management
capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information.
These solutions have enabled us to access a wider breadth of credit active customers earlier in the value chain,
before the delinquency phase.

As the Group continues to develop, we expect to further capitalize on the Group’s strengths by: (i)
delivering a multi-product, multi-service and pan-regional offering while maintaining clear pricing discipline; (ii)
establishing an industry benchmark for operational excellence through investments in its one-stop service
offering; (iii) maintaining a reputation for pioneering insights by continuously improving its IT, data and
collection platforms through innovations and investment; (iv) continuing to take a best practices approach to its
client relationships and (v) continuing to invest in its employees and corporate culture.

**Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

The Group’s business and results of operations have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected
by certain key factors, including acquisitions, and we expect these key factors to affect our business in the future.
Each of these additional factors is discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of how COVID-19 has affected
and may continue to affect our business, see “—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market, Financial
_and Other Risk—COVID-19” and “Summary—Recent Developments—COVID-19.”_

**_Portfolio Purchases_**

We typically purchase a large number of lower-value debt portfolios, which enables us to purchase debt
portfolios regularly in order to expand our operations. As a result, the relative significance of individual debt


-----

originators changes from year to year. We also seek to adopt a diversified purchase strategy and as a result
purchased debt portfolios with a purchase price of at least £100,000 from 27 vendors in our UK Division and debt
portfolios with a purchase price of at least €100,000 from 30 vendors in our DACH Division and 31 vendors in
our Northern European Division, in each case in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020.

As of June 30, 2020, our UK Division’s Backbook was made up of approximately 15.8 million active
accounts and 2,473 owned debt portfolios, 66% of which cost less than £0.5 million, with the 30 largest owned
debt portfolios comprising 13% of ERC. Our UK Division’s owned debt portfolios are also diversified across
primarily three different sectors, with 52% originated in the financial services sector, 24% in the retail sector and
20% in the telecommunications sector (for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and based on portfolio
purchases).

As of June 30, 2020, our DACH Division’s Backbook was made up of approximately 4.1 million active
accounts and 562 owned debt portfolios, 85% of which cost less than €0.5 million, with the 30 largest owned debt
portfolio purchases comprising 10% of ERC. Our DACH Division owned debt portfolios are primarily diversified
across four different sectors, with 58% originated in the financial services section, 2% in the retail sector, 2% in
the telecommunications sector and 7% in the fitness sector with the remaining 31% in other sectors such as
utilities, public services, leisure and tourism (for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and based on portfolio
purchases).

As of June 30, 2020, our Northern European Division’s Backbook was made up of approximately 2.3
million active accounts and 1,246 owned debt portfolios, 79% of which cost less than €0.5 million, with the 30
largest owned debt portfolio purchases comprising 10% of ERC. Our Northern European Division owned debt
portfolios are primarily diversified across two different sectors, with 91% originated in the financial services
section, 8% in the retail sector with the remaining 1% in other sectors such as utilities (for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2020 and based on portfolio purchases).

There are two principal models for purchasing portfolios of debt: spot sale agreements and forward flow
agreements. In a spot sale, we agree to buy a portfolio of claims that we receive in one transaction upon payment.
In our DACH Division, spot sales are mostly conducted through auctions, especially in the financial services
sector, while in our UK Division, spot sales are mostly conducted through sealed bids, and in our Northern
European Division, sales are conducted through competitive tender processes. In a forward flow agreement, we
agree to buy claims with predetermined characteristics at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume
from a client on an ongoing basis. See “Our Group’s Business—Debt Purchase—Debt Portfolio Purchase—Types
_of Debt Purchase Agreements.” In the period from our UK Division’s Start Date (June 1, 2004) to June 30, 2020,_
43% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements or agreements that were a mixture
of a forward flow agreement with a spot purchase, representing £845.8 million in portfolio purchases. In the period
from our DACH Division’s Start Date (September 30, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 48% of its portfolio purchases were
made pursuant to forward flow agreements, representing €320.1 million in portfolio purchases. In the period from
our Northern European Division’s Start Date (January 1, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 31% of its portfolio purchases
were made pursuant to forward flow agreements, representing €361.4 million in portfolio purchases. We believe
our ability to secure and renew forward flow agreements is a key driver of our performance as these increase client
retention and thereby provide greater earnings visibility.

As of June 30, 2020, our UK Division’s cumulative portfolio purchases were £1,974.0 million, its
cumulative active accounts were approximately 15.8 million and the aggregate face value at time of purchase of
its owned debt portfolios was £23.5 billion. As of June 30, 2020, our DACH Division’s cumulative portfolio
purchases were €664.3 million, its cumulative active accounts was approximately 4.1 million and the aggregate
face value at time of purchase of its owned debt portfolios was €6.4 billion. As of June 30, 2020, our Northern
European Division’s cumulative portfolio purchases were €1,181.1 million (equivalent), its cumulative active
accounts was approximately 2.3 million and the aggregate face value at time of purchase of its owned debt
portfolios was €6.1 billion.

(1) Portfolio purchases represents our investment in new debt portfolios for the period and is determined by adding the purchase prices of
debt portfolios acquired during the period. The purchase price of a debt portfolio is the value at which it was initially recorded on our or
our predecessor’s consolidated balance sheet, as applicable, at the time of purchase.

(2) The face value of an owned debt portfolio means the nominal value of receivables and includes any accrued interest, fees and costs
applied by the originator at the time of purchase. Face value at time of purchase represents the face value of the debt portfolio at the time
we acquired it, and may include the face value of accounts that have since settled, closed or otherwise become inactive. See “Presentation
_of Financial and Other Information—Non-Financial Operating Data.”_

(3) Portfolio purchases as a percentage of the face value of owned debt portfolios acquired per annum is generally not comparable on a yearto-year basis. This is due to the varying characteristics of the owned debt portfolios acquired, such as the type, size, quality, industry and
maturity profile, each of which can have a direct impact on the pricing of such portfolios. For example, if in a given year, the owned
debt portfolios acquired primarily comprise debt portfolios of fresher claims with a higher probability to pay, then our portfolio purchases
as a percentage of face value in that period may be higher than a prior or subsequent period, independent of any general market trends
in overall pricing.

Our performance is dependent on our ability to purchase debt portfolios across all sectors that meet our
minimum return criteria, which in turn is driven by the volume of debt made available for sale by debt originators
and vendors, competitive dynamics and our ability to price portfolios accurately.

The volume of debt portfolios sold each year comes from (i) the book of defaulted debt in that year and
(ii) the backlog of debt defaulted in prior years that remains unsold. The pricing of debt portfolios also affects the
volume of debt portfolios sold each year, as it determines whether it is more economically attractive for a vendor
to sell the debt or to warehouse it for further in-house or outsourced collections.

Competition also affects our ability to purchase portfolios. The majority of portfolios across all sectors
are currently offered to the market through spot sales conducted through a competitive tender process. In recent
years, we believe that there has been a trend towards increased concentration of the debt purchase industry around
a small core group of purchasers. It is possible that there will be new entrants or companies re-entering the debt
purchase market. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We are active in competitive
_markets and may be unable to continue to successfully compete with businesses that may offer more attractive_
_prices or have greater financial resources, less expensive funding or lower return requirements than we have.”_
We typically compete with one or two of these debt purchasers in the last stages of debt auctions. We compete
mainly on the basis of price and compliance credentials. Pricing on portfolio purchases for both of our divisions
is conducted at the Group level. See “Our Group’s Business—Debt Purchase.”


-----

While most of the debt portfolios are sold through competitive tender processes in spot sales, we have
many long-standing relationships that have helped improve our portfolio-purchasing ability. For example, 87%
of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 were purchased from clients
with which we have held a relationship for 5 years or more. We also purchase portfolios by entering into forward
flow agreements, whereby we agree to purchase all or substantially all of the debt originator’s debt sales, generally
through a bilateral sale, subject to the debt originator’s compliance with pre-agreed criteria. Since inception to
June 30, 2020, 43% of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases, 48% of our DACH Division’s portfolio purchases
and 31% of our Northern European Division’s portfolio purchases were made pursuant to such forward flow
agreements or agreements that were a mixture of a forward flow agreement with a spot purchase.

The ability to purchase debt portfolios is also dependent on access to financing. Should we lose access
to financing, we may not be able to make new acquisitions of debt portfolios. See “—Liquidity and Capital
_Resources.”_

**_Estimated Remaining Collections (“ERC”)_**

We define ERC as the future collections expected to be received on our owned debt portfolios during a
120- or 180-month period. These projections were prepared for illustrative purposes only and are different from
the forecasts we use to calculate the carrying amount of the Group’s owned debt portfolios as recognized in the
Group Consolidated Financial Statements. We calculate ERC using data derived from our databases of owned and
service debt portfolio in the markets in which we operate, proprietary behavioral and asset valuation models and
specialist local input. We synthesize these inputs to create collection forecasts over a 120-month period, with
respect to the Group and our UK Division, and a 180-month period, with respect to our DACH and Northern
European Divisions. Our DACH and Northern European Divisions calculate ERC on a 180-month basis because
debt collection claims are subject to longer statutes of limitation in those regions, and we therefore expect to be
able to achieve collections on owned debt portfolios over a longer period.

References to our ERC in this Offering Memorandum are references to gross ERC (which includes
estimated collections in respect of principal balance, costs, service costs and fees). ERC calculations are often
used by other companies to present collections estimates covering collection periods comparable throughout the
CMS industry even though ERC might be calculated differently in detail. We believe that our 120M ERC
represents an important supplemental measure to compare our cash generating capacity with other companies in
the CMS industry, even though we can provide no assurance that we will achieve such collections within the
specified time period, or at all.

In order to assess our cash generation, we calculate our Group Replacement Rate, which we use as a
proxy amount of capital required to maintain our Group ERC (the sum of our UK Division’s 120-month ERC and
our DACH and Northern European Divisions’ 180-month ERC) at a specific point in time. Our Group
Replacement Rate takes into account our expected reduction in ERC over the coming year by deducting year-one
expected collections from our Group ERC and adding the collections that currently sit outside each division’s
ERC horizon, being collections expected in months 121-132 for the UK Division and months 181-192 for the
DACH and Northern European Divisions. This provides our hypothetical Group ERC in twelve months’ time if
we make no portfolio purchases during the period. We then use our current trading Gross Money Multiples to
calculate our end-of period replacement rate, which is the implied amount of portfolio purchases that would be
required to make up the difference between our actual Group ERC and our hypothetical Group ERC after a year
without any portfolio purchases. We average the end-of-period replacement rate with that of the prior period to
determine our in-year Group ERC Replacement Rate.

The table below sets forth a reconciliation from the IFRS carrying amount of our purchased debt to our
ERC.

(1) For financial reporting purposes, collections are shown at their present value by discounting them at the effective interest rate (“EIR”)
of each individual owned debt portfolio (as determined at acquisition), whereas our ERC is prepared on an undiscounted basis. The EIR
is the rate that exactly discounts the day-one estimated future cash receipts of the owned debt portfolio to the net carrying amount at
initial recognition (i.e., the purchase price). These estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the estimated remaining life of the
portfolios and range from 84 months to 120 months.

**_Asset Base_**

_Group_

We have experienced significant growth in our asset base. Based on our models as of June 30, 2020, we
expect that the aggregate face value of the Group’s owned debt portfolios (active accounts only) of £17.4 billion
will generate approximately £3,466.1 million in Gross Debt Purchase Collections over the next 120 months. As
of June 30, 2020, we expected approximately 34% of our 120M ERC to be collected within the next 24 months
and approximately 58% to be collected within the next 48 months. These expectations are based on historical data
as well as assumptions about future collection rates. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve such collections.

_UK Division_

Our UK Division has experienced significant growth in its asset base. Based on its models as of June 30,
2020, our UK Division expects that the aggregate face value of its owned debt portfolios (active accounts only)
of £9.6 billion will generate approximately £2,069.0 million in Gross Debt Purchase Collections over the next
120 months. As of June 30, 2020, our UK Division expected approximately 34% of its ERC (calculated over a
120-month period) to be collected within the next 24 months and approximately 58% to be collected within the
next 48 months. These expectations are based on historical data as well as assumptions about future collection
rates. Our UK Division cannot guarantee that it will achieve such collections.

_DACH Division_

Our DACH Division has experienced significant growth in its asset base. Based on its models as of June
30, 2020, our DACH Division expects that the aggregate face value of its owned debt portfolios (active accounts
only) of £3.0 billion will generate approximately £640.3 million in Gross Debt Purchase Collections over the next
180 months. As of June 30, 2020, our DACH Division expected approximately 31% of its ERC (calculated over
a 180-month period) to be collected within the next 24 months and approximately 51% to be collected within the
next 48 months. These expectations are based on historical data as well as assumptions about future collection
rates. Our DACH Division cannot guarantee that it will achieve such collections.

The following table sets forth our DACH Division’s ERC vintage by year as of June 30, 2020 (in £

_Northern European Division_

Our Northern European Division has experienced significant growth in its asset base. Based on its models
as of June 30, 2020, our Northern European Division expects that the aggregate face value of its owned debt
portfolios (active accounts only) of £4.8 billion will generate approximately £1,004.8 million in Gross Debt
Purchase Collections over the next 180 months. As of June 30, 2020, our Northern European Division expected
approximately 28% of its ERC (calculated over a 180-month period) to be collected within the next 24 months

**_Collections_**

Our primary sources of revenue are (i) the cash proceeds received from our collection efforts on the
consumer accounts in our owned debt portfolios and (ii) fees and cost-reimbursements from our third-party
collection services. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 43% of our gross collections came from Gross
Debt Purchase Collections and the remaining 57% came from third-party collection services. The majority of our
paying consumers make their payments through long-term, low-installment plans. These installment plans
typically see payments being made through automated and predictable methods such as direct debit.

The amount a consumer pays generally varies depending on the portion of the consumer’s disposable
income available to rectify his or her financial situation. We believe in offering our consumers the choice of
clearing their outstanding balances through practical, affordable and personalized monthly installments in addition
to one-off settlements. Our collections performance is therefore assisted by our ability to build, using our internal
data intelligence systems, a detailed and dynamic understanding of our consumers’ circumstances.

Since the financial year ended 2004, our UK Division has demonstrated collections growth each year.
From the financial year ended August 31, 2007 to the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, it has grown its twelvemonth Gross Debt Purchase Collections from £50.8 million to £443.7 million, and despite the changing economic
environment, actual collections closely followed the collection forecasts made before the financial crisis. From its
Start Date (June 1, 2004) to June 30, 2020, our UK Division achieved Gross Debt Purchase Collections of £3,014.4
million and, as of June 30, 2020, its owned debt portfolios had a 120-month ERC of £2,069.0 million, generating
a Gross Money Multiple of 2.6x on a cumulative basis.

Our DACH Division also, generally, has a strong track record in outperforming its initial collection
forecasts on the portfolios purchased. From its Start Date (September 30, 2003) to June 30, 2020, our DACH
Division achieved Gross Debt Purchase Collections of €1,392.9 million and, as of June 30, 2020, its owned debt
portfolios had a 180-month ERC of €702.1 million, generating a Gross Money Multiple of 3.2x on a cumulative
basis.

Our Northern European Division also, generally, has a strong track record in outperforming its initial
collection forecasts on the portfolios purchased. From its Start Date (January 1, 2003) to June 30, 2020, our
Northern European Division achieved Gross Debt Purchase Collections of €1,905.3 million and, as of June 30,
2020, its owned debt portfolios had a 180-month ERC of €1,101.8 million, generating a Gross Money Multiple
of 2.5x on a cumulative basis.


-----

Management believes the historical resilience of its collections in this period of weak economic
conditions was supported by:

    - **_Low average payments and account diversification. During the twelve months ended June 30,_**
2020, our UK Division received on average 2.0 million unique payments per month, with an
average monthly payment of £18.19. In the DACH Division during the same period, we received
on average 0.45 million unique payments per month, with an average monthly payment of €94.37.
In the Northern European Division during the same period, we received on average 0.33 million
unique payments per month, with an average monthly payment of €118.51. As of June 30, 2020,
the average account balance in our UK Division’s owned debt portfolios was £702.57, the average
account balance in our DACH Division’s owned debt portfolios was €934.37, the average account
balance in our DACH Division’s 3PC serviced portfolios was €1,945.80, the average account
balance in our Northern European Division’s owned debt portfolios was €2,330.14 and the average
account balance in our Northern European Division’s 3PC serviced portfolios was €1,886.74. We
believe that our low average monthly payments and the fact that our consumers are typically
already in financial distress or unemployed have provided some degree of protection against
changes in our consumers’ disposable income.

    - **_Predictable collections from recurring payment methods. Of our £455.4 million of UK Division_**
Gross Debt Purchase Collections in the year ended December 31, 2019, 89% came from existing
accounts already owned as of December 31, 2018 and 79% were paid pursuant to payment plans.
Across our UK Division’s Backbook, as of December 31, 2019, the majority of our monthly
collections came from recurring payments, such as direct debits and continuous payment
authorizations on debit and credit cards. Of our €178.0 million of DACH Division Gross Debt
Purchase Collections in the year ended December 31, 2019, 74% came from existing portfolios
already owned as of December 31, 2018. Of our €192.6 million of Northern European Division
Gross Debt Purchase Collections in the year ended December 31, 2019, 90% came from existing
portfolios already owned as of December 31, 2018.

    - **_Close performance monitoring and sophisticated data mining capabilities. By tracking the_**
financial circumstances of individual consumers, we have been able to proactively adjust
consumers’ payment plans in a way we believe optimizes returns. Our UK Division’s default rate
among its paying consumers decreased from 6.63% to 5.33% between June 30, 2019 and June 30,
2020, calculated as the percentage of payment plans which made no payments in the month a
payment was due, based on a six-month average. Our DACH Division’s default rate decreased
from 18.0% to 11.0% between June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020, calculated as the percentage over
a six-month period of collections compared to expected collections, which were derived by the last
six months of agreed payments. We believe this approach both helps our consumers meet their
obligations and helps us to reach our return targets. However, we may not always be able to adjust
in such a way in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our
_need to adapt to consumers’ changing financial circumstances may result in increased servicing_
_costs, reduced cash flow or imprecise modeling.”_

**_Returns on Portfolio Purchases_**

_UK Division_

While returns achieved on individual portfolios can vary, our UK Division has a record of generating
strong and consistent returns on its owned debt portfolios. Based on historical and expected collections, as of June
30, 2020, its ERC was £2,069.0 million. The table below sets forth certain data related to our UK Division’s
owned debt portfolios and other defaulted receivables by vintage, such as portfolio purchases, Gross Debt
Purchase Collections, our UK Division’s ERC and Gross Money Multiple incorporating our UK Division’s ERC

(1) Portfolio purchases represents our investment in new debt portfolios for the period and is determined by adding the purchase prices of
debt portfolios acquired during the period. The purchase price of a debt portfolio is the value at which it was initially recorded on our or
our predecessor’s consolidated balance sheet, as applicable, at the time of purchase.

(2) Face value at time of purchase represents the face value of the debt portfolio at the time we acquired it, and may include the face value
of accounts that have since settled, closed or otherwise become inactive.

(3) Estimated Remaining Collections (ERC) is the future collections projected to be received on all of our UK Division’s owned debt
portfolios based on our forecasting models. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our UK Division forecasts collections over a
120-month period.

(4) Gross Money Multiple is the total expected cash return from owned debt portfolios calculated as the sum of cumulative Gross Debt
Purchase Collections achieved by our UK Division through June 30, 2020 and our UK Division’s 120-month ERC, divided by cumulative
portfolio purchases. The Gross Money Multiples for our UK Division’s early vintages are impacted by the business going through its
initial growth cycle. Vintages during the financial crisis benefit from our UK Division’s leveraging of its growing data asset to enhance
both pricing and operational capability and thereby drive increased collection performance. More recent vintages have primarily not had
the benefit of time as these older vintages have, as Gross Money Multiple is based on collections to date.

_DACH Division_

While returns achieved on individual portfolios can vary, our DACH Division has a record of generating
strong and consistent returns on its owned debt portfolios. Based on historical and expected collections, as of June
30, 2020, its ERC was €702.1 million. The table below sets forth certain data related to our DACH Division’s
owned debt portfolios and other defaulted receivables by vintage, such as Portfolios Purchases, Gross Collections,

not had the benefit of time as these older vintages have, as Gross Money Multiple is based on collections to date.

_Northern European Division_

While returns achieved on individual portfolios can vary, our Northern European Division has a record
of generating strong and consistent returns on its owned debt portfolios. Based on historical and expected
collections, as of June 30, 2020, its ERC was €1,101.8 million. The table below sets forth certain data related to
our Northern European Division’s owned debt portfolios and other defaulted receivables by vintage, such as
portfolio purchases, Gross Collections, our Northern European Division’s ERC and Gross Money Multiple
incorporating our Northern European Division’s ERC as of June 30, 2020.

(1) Portfolio purchases represents our investment in new debt portfolios for the period and is determined by adding the purchase prices of
debt portfolios acquired during the period. The purchase price of a debt portfolio is the value at which it was initially recorded on our or
our predecessor’s consolidated balance sheet, as applicable, at the time of purchase.

(2) Face value at time of purchase represents the face value of the debt portfolio at the time we acquired it, and may include the face value
of accounts that have since settled, closed or otherwise become inactive.


-----

(3) Estimated Remaining Collections (ERC) is the future collections projected to be received on all of our Northern European Division’s
owned debt portfolios based on our forecasting models. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our Northern European Division
forecasts collections over a 180-month period.

(4) Gross Money Multiple is the total expected cash return from owned debt portfolios calculated as the sum of cumulative Gross Debt
Purchase Collections achieved by our Northern European Division through June 30, 2020 and our Northern European Division’s ERC,
divided by cumulative portfolio purchases. The Gross Money Multiples for our Northern European Division’s early vintages are
impacted by the business going through its initial growth cycle. Vintages during the financial crisis benefit from our Northern European
Division’s leveraging of its growing data asset to enhance both pricing and operational capability and thereby drive increased collection
performance. More recent vintages have primarily not had the benefit of time as these older vintages have, as Gross Money Multiple is
based on collections to date.

For more information on how we calculate ERC and Gross Money Multiples, see “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—Non-Financial Operating Data.”_

In addition, the volume of receivables outsourced to us on behalf of debt originators, and consequently
our revenue from third-party collections services is linked to our historical ability to collect on defaulted debt and
on our relationships with our third-party collection services clients, particularly in the DACH Division, including
our ability to demonstrate strong collection levels. Our third-party collection revenue is generated both by the fees
we receive from originators as part of the successful recovery of defaulted debt, as well as the fees and additional
interest we receive from consumers, including cost reimbursement, as prescribed by law. Our third-party
collection services clients actively manage the outsourcing process. Depending on how well we perform, our
clients may release more claims to us or, conversely, if we have performed poorly compared to our peer group,
reduce the number of claims that we service. We offer flexible pricing arrangements to our third-party collection
services clients that are tailored to the specific circumstances of the client and the relevant claims to be outsourced.
We believe that the benefits of our effective claims collection strategy result in long-standing client relationships,
evidenced by entering into master servicing agreements to provide collection services on clients’ debt and other
defaulted receivables that we have not purchased.

**_Operational efficiency_**

Implementing an effective and efficient debt collection strategy at all stages of the collection life cycle
is a key factor driving our revenue and operating expenses. Our debt collection process is standardized and highly
automated, with the goal of maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt. We endeavor to foster
payment solutions, such as bespoke repayment plans, that provide visibility on the cash collected and minimize
default risk for consumers.

Our approach to collections is focused on delivering the highest net return on capital by optimizing costs
versus collection potential. Historically, for example, from our UK Division’s inception through June 30, 2020,
in our UK Division we have only needed to collect from 29% of our consumer accounts in order to achieve our
returns. To deliver our targeted returns on investments, we use collection strategies to decide the level of resources
to deploy on each account. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on our consumers’ ability and willingness to
pay, which allows us to develop tailored collection strategies to optimize servicing efficiency and return on capital.
For example, the ability to segment our DACH Division accounts, using internally developed scorecards, allows
us to locate those accounts which are most able and/or likely to pay and simultaneously will increase our collection
rates and optimize our costs. We are also focused on controlling our overhead through reducing our discretionary
spending.

Year-on-year and other period-on-period trends in our collection cost percentages are not necessarily
indicative of our operational efficiency and the return on capital we can achieve on our owned debt portfolios, as
they are impacted by the varying characteristics of the portfolios we purchase in different years and differences
in the timing of portfolio acquisitions during the year. Specifically, we believe that recent trends in our collection
cost ratio have been driven by: (i) the characteristics of the owned debt portfolio (i.e., the industry or specific
contractual arrangement of the debt); (ii) significant improvements in the operational efficiency of our collections
team, primarily due to our implementation of a more automated and centralized debt collection function; and
(iii) changes in the volume of claims and other outstanding debt collected which can vary in any given period
based on a number of factors outside of our control, such as the general macroeconomic condition in the UK,
DACH and Northern Europe. See “—Economic Conditions.”

In the DACH Division, we have systematically carried out projects that have had, and that we believe
will continue to have, a positive effect on our operations. We have divested a number of non-core activities and
smaller businesses during the periods under review. In addition to making strategic divestitures, we have made
strategic DACH-region acquisitions to complement our collections processes, such as the acquisition of DMA in
2014, a data solution provider that sources information from more than 15 data information companies via a


-----

central platform. The acquisition of DMA has afforded our decision science team a competitive advantage by
providing them a multi-sourcing data information tool as well as unique data products leveraging best-of-breed
data sources, and our DACH-region business has improved its collection processes by implementing internal
initiatives such as our service center, which is a centralized automated hub for managing mail and processing
millions of incoming and outgoing letters annually. In addition, we have further enhanced our one-stop CMS
solution and our geographic footprint through our acquisitions of IS Inkasso Service, the Tesch Group and
Apontas.

In the Northern European Division, optimizing customer contact at each stage of the collection life cycle
is the key to our debt collection strategy. Our debt collection process is standardized and automated, with the goal
of maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable
settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach rather than exploiting shortterm collection potential. We benefit when purchasing a portfolio since any effects resulting from allocating
additional resources and cost to collect to such portfolio is attributed to us, whereas in debt collection the additional
resources and cost merely produce a marginal increase in commissions and in many cases require clients to accept
a higher commission in order for us to benefit from the additional revenue generated. Debt purchasing does not
require clients to take this risk, but clients can realize some of the benefit by receiving an attractive price level.

Year-on-year trends in the Northern European Division’s collection cost ratio are not necessarily
indicative of operational efficiency and the return on capital that can be achieved on purchased debt, as they are
impacted by the varying characteristics of the portfolios we purchase in different years and differences in the
timing of portfolio acquisitions during the year. Specifically, we believe that recent trends in collection cost ratios
have been driven by: (i) significant improvements in the operational efficiency of our collections team, primarily
due to the implementation of more efficient collection methods, such as text messages and other automated
processes, and a well-balanced level of operating expenses; and (ii) changes in the volume, mix and timing of
portfolio acquisitions in each year.

Operational efficiency is key to the Northern European Division’s business model and a main advantage
of its business compared to competitors and financial institutions and other customer companies that handle their
debt collection in-house. We begin the debt collection process by segmenting or scoring customers according to
the predicted likelihood that they will pay, based on criteria such as past payment history, size and type of debt,
customer’s age and gender and whether the debt was incurred by a consumer or a business. Thereafter, we
determine which collection method to use for the specific claim, such as calls, letters, text messages, and emails,
depending on various factors, including the geographical market, the claim size, the client we are acting on behalf
of, the applicable laws and regulations and the individual customer. We believe the Northern European Division
is able to lower collection costs due to its large scale and automation of the debt collection process and the
Northern European Division is able to increase recovery rates through its data assets and analytical capabilities to
optimally tailor debt collection strategies based on past experiences. As a result, we believe that the Northern
European Division can optimize collection efficiency over the lifetime of the claim. In addition, we have enhanced
further enhanced our geographic footprint with the 2018 Acquisitions.

Our Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA increased from £496.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 to £512.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Our operating profit decreased from £150.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to £112.0 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Financial Information” and _“Summary Consolidated_
_Financial and Other Information for the Group—Other Group Financial and Operating Data.”_

In the period from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020, the twelve-month Gross Debt Purchase Collections
per call center agent in our UK Division grew from £676,000 to £828,000. In the period from June 30, 2019 to
June 30, 2020, the twelve-month Gross Debt Purchase Collections per call center agent in our DACH Division
grew from approximately €724,000 to €1,051,000, reflecting our ability to collect on our growing asset base over
the period with increasing efficiency. In the period from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020, the twelve-month Gross
Debt Purchase Collections per call center agent in our Northern European Division grew from approximately
€811,000 to €966,000.

**_Regulatory considerations_**

Our results of operations are affected by a number of laws and regulations in the EU, UK and Norway.
We are subject to regulatory and compliance requirements relating to labor, license requirements, consumer credit,
debt collection, default interest calculation, statutes of limitation, data protection, anti-corruption, tax and VAT,
handling of client funds and other regulatory regimes. We have detailed policies and procedures in place that are


-----

designed to foster compliance with applicable law and to ensure that compliance issues, if any, are identified and
appropriately elevated within the organization. Our policy regarding regulatory compliance defines, among other
things, governing principles regarding identification of governing laws and regulations, delegation of compliance
responsibilities, guidelines on education and competence, testing and documentation of regulatory compliance
control measures.

The regulatory environment for debt collection in the EU, the UK, and Norway requires considerable
investment in processes, know-how and management. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, a
significant amount of financial and technical resources in order to achieve and maintain compliance with these
requirements. From September 30, 2013 to June 30, 2020 in the UK Division, for example, we have increased the
number of FTEs in our compliance team from 43 to 103.

In our UK, DACH and Northern Europe divisions, compliance systems and controls, as well as the
training of employees, to increase awareness of regulatory requirements and policies are in place. We provide
comprehensive training to employees on legal and regulatory compliance and require employees to complete a
designated compliance module as well as regular interactive refreshers and tests.

For further discussion of the regulations affecting us and the risks posed by these regulations, see
“Regulation,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We are subject to EU, UK, German
_and Norwegian regulations, among others, and changes to the regulatory environment or a failure to comply with_
_applicable laws, regulations, authorizations, licenses and codes of practice may negatively affect our business.”_

**_Seasonality_**

We see limited seasonal fluctuations in our collections from portfolios, which tend to be lower for months
in which there are fewer working days, for example in months with public holidays.

**_Acquisitions_**

Historically, we have had a strong track record of selective and accretive expansion in the UK and DACH
divisions, as demonstrated by our DACH Division’s acquisitions of DMA, ITT and more recent acquisitions of
IS Inkasso Service, the Tesch Group and Apontas in 2016 and the acquisitions of Lowell Sverige and Lowell AS
in 2018, forming our Northern European Division further supplemented by Lucas Credit Services Limited in 2019
and Solvencia AS in 2020. We intend to participate opportunistically in a disciplined manner in the consolidation
of the European CMS industry in order to build scale, address untapped consumer segments and create new
relationships with debt originators. We intend to strategically pursue further carve-out transactions with current
clients and small, credit-accretive bolt-on acquisitions.

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. First, our results for the period during which
an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our consolidated
results. Because acquired businesses are included in our consolidation perimeter from the date of completion of
each relevant acquisition, their full impact is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period.
In addition, the results of the acquired businesses after their acquisition may be impacted positively by synergies.
For larger strategic acquisitions, we may experience a temporary increase in investments and both operational and
personnel expenses as we integrate the acquired business into our network.

Because of changes in our corporate structure following a number of changes in ownership, we carry a
significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet (£1,226.9 million as of June 30, 2020). Goodwill is subject
to an impairment test annually and whenever there are indications of impairment. We may record significant
charges in our income statement in the event of impairment under IFRS. As a result of our acquisition accounting
policies, our acquisition of entities that own debt portfolios may cause us to recognize fair value releases in
subsequent financial statements which may affect our results. See _“Results of Operations—Description of the_
_Group’s Principal IFRS Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Items—Portfolio fair value release.”_

**Significant Factors Affecting Comparability**

**_Historical Acquisitions_**

On March 20, 2018, we completed the 2018 Acquisitions to acquire a 100% share in Lowell Sverige,
Lowell AS and their subsidiaries. The results of the acquisitions are included in the Group Consolidated Financial
Statements from April 1, 2018. The consolidated financial information reported by the Group following the 2018
Acquisitions is not comparable with the consolidated financial information reported prior to the 2018


-----

Acquisitions, or with the consolidated financial information for 2019, which included a full year of the results of
the Northern European Division (compared to only nine months in 2018).

**Results of Operations**

**_Description of the Group’s Principal IFRS Statement of Financial Position Items_**

Below is a summary description of portfolio investments, a key line item of the 2019 Group Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year ending December 31, 2019, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS. This
line item is also among the balance sheet data that appear in the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements
and the Unaudited Group Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Presentation of Financial
_and Other Information” for information regarding our financial information._

_Portfolio investments_

Portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value and
classified as purchased or originated credit impaired in line with IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments). The portfolio
investments are initially recorded at their fair value, which is their purchase price, and are subsequently measured
at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) method in accordance with IFRS 9 (Financial
_Instruments)._

The cash flow that each portfolio investment is expected to generate over the 12 months following the
date of the statement of financial position is calculated, and this portion of each portfolio investment’s carrying
value is classified as current. The remaining portion of this carrying value is classified as non-current.

**_Description of the Group’s Principal IFRS Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Items_**

Below is a summary description of the key elements of the line items of the 2019 Group Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year ending December 31, 2019, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS.
These line items are also among the financial data related to comprehensive income that appear in the in the 2018
Group Consolidated Financial Statements and the Unaudited Group Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” for information regarding our financial
information.

_Income from portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments (the Group’s owned debt portfolios) represents the yield from owned
debt portfolio investments, net of VAT where applicable. Owned debt portfolio investments are financial
instruments that are accounted for using IAS 39 (Financial Instruments), and are measured at amortized cost using
the effective interest method.

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts of the owned
debt portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition (i.e., the price paid to acquire the asset). These
estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the conditions within the markets in which the Group operates and
range from 84 months to 120 months.

Owned debt portfolio investments are purchased at a deep discount and as a result the estimated future
cash flows reflect the likely credit losses within each portfolio.

_Net portfolio write-up_

Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cash flows be deemed greater
than previous estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period considered for estimated future cash
receipts. Upward adjustments to carrying values as a result of reassessments to forecasted cash flows are
recognized in the net portfolio write-up line item within income, with subsequent reversals also recorded in this
line. If these reversals exceed cumulative income recognized to date, an impairment is recognized in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income.

_Portfolio fair value release_

Portfolio fair value adjustments are made as part of the purchase price allocations when the group
acquires other companies. These adjust the value of the portfolios to fair value. The portfolio fair value release


-----

represents the unwinding of this fair value uplift. This uplift is being unwound in line with the profile of the gross
ERC over an 84 month period from the date of acquisition in keeping with the standard collection curve profile
in the UK.

_Service revenue_

Service revenue represents amounts receivable for tracing and debt collecting services (commissions and
fees) provided to third-party clients including collection lawyers, net of VAT where applicable. The revenue is
recognized when the service is provided (accrual basis) which in this case is when cash is collected from the
consumer on behalf of the Group’s client.

_Collection activity costs_

Collection activity costs represent the direct third-party costs incurred in providing services as a debt
collection agency or collecting debts on owned debt portfolio investments; examples include printing and postage,
third party commissions, search and trace costs, litigation, telephone and SMS text costs. They are recognized as
the costs are incurred (accruals basis).

_Other expenses_

Other expenses consist of operating expenses such as staff costs, office rent and other expenses related
to the premises, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets, together
with the write-down of non-performing loans, among other expenses.

_Finance income_

Finance income consists of the interest receivable on our bank accounts, and the fair value measurement
of derivatives.

_Finance costs_

Finance costs consist of interest charges and fees on the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility,
interest accruing on shareholder loan notes issued by our parent undertaking, together with losses on the fair value
of financial instruments and foreign exchange losses.

_Tax (expense) / credit_

The charge/credit for taxation is based on trading results, and takes account of taxation deferred or
accelerated because of timing differences between the treatments of certain items for taxation and accounting
purposes, principally the treatment of capital expenditure, for which capital allowances allowable for taxation
purposes differs from depreciation for accounting purposes, the timing and utilization of tax losses, and the nondeductibility of an element of the interest accruing on shareholder loans and shares.

**_Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2019_**

_Consolidated Statement of Financial Position_

_Portfolio Investments_

Portfolio investments increased by £37.5 million, or 2.3%, as of June 30, 2020 as compared to June 30,
2019 primarily due to £351.1 million of portfolio purchases made over the twelve-month period (with a decrease
in portfolio purchases for our UK and Northern European Divisions partially offset by increased portfolio
purchases for our DACH Division compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2019), as well as £394.6 million
of income from portfolio investments and net portfolio write-up of £56.0 million offset by collections of £771.6
million.

_Income from portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments increased by £17.5 million, or 9.6%, to £199.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2020 from £182.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to the
increased level of portfolio investments held by the Group yielding a correspondingly greater income.

_Net portfolio write (down)/up_

Net portfolio write-up decreased by £88.9 million to a net write down of £2.7 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2020 from a write-up of £86.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was
primarily due to the deferment of expected collections as a result of COVID-19.

_Portfolio fair value release_

Portfolio fair value release decreased by £0.2 million, or 25.0%, to £0.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020 from £0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Portfolio fair value adjustments are made
as part of the purchase price allocations when the Group acquires other companies. These adjust the value of the
portfolio to fair value. The portfolio fair value release represents the unwinding of the fair value uplift. The
decrease is primarily due to the unwinding of the fair value uplift on portfolio valuation of the UK Division at the
time of the acquisition of the Lowell Group. There was greater release in the early years due to the front loaded
nature of the ERC curve, which was used as the basis for the release.

_Service revenue_

Service revenue decreased by £17.5 million, or 15.8%, to £93.6 million for the six months ended June
30, 2020 from £111.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the
strategic closure of Frederickson International as part of our UK 3PC business.

_Collection activity costs_

Collection activity costs decreased by £31.5 million, or 18.1%, to £142.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2020 from £174.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by the decision
to cease litigation activity in the UK in response to COVID-19 developments alongside general collection
efficiency improvements. Out of our total collection activity costs, lawyer service costs were £19.5 million and
non-recurring costs were £1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to £26.4 million and
£2.5 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2019.


-----

_Other expenses_

Other expenses decreased by £19.2 million, or 14.6%, to £111.9 million for the six months ended June
30, 2020 from £131.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to cost
reduction initiatives together with a reduced number of FTEs as the business becomes more digital and efficient.
Out of the £111.9 million of other expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2020, £21.0 million constituted
depreciation, amortization and impairment and £15.7 million constituted non-recurring costs, compared to £19.9
million and £22.9 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

_Finance income_

Finance income increased by £9.8 million to £13.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from
£3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to movements in the fair value of the
derivatives held by the Group.

_Finance costs_

Finance costs decreased by £0.8 million, or 0.7%, to £108.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2020 from £109.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This movement reflects the impact of an overall
increase in debt held which has been offset by a reduction in net loss on financial instruments designated as fair
value through profit or loss.

_Income tax credit_

Income tax credit increased by £12.3 million, or 768.8%, to £13.9 million for the six months ended June
30, 2020 from £1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to primarily due the recognition
of a £12.3 million deferred tax asset recognized within the UK.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018_**

_Consolidated Statement of Financial Position_

_Portfolio Investments_

Portfolio investments increased by £99.1 million, or 6.4%, as of December 31, 2019 as compared to
December 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in debt purchases made during 2019, partially offset by a £38.0
million decrease due to currency exchange movements.

(a) The unaudited consolidated financial information of Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS and their subsidiaries for the three months ended
March 31, 2018 were calculated by adding the unaudited consolidated financial information of Lowell Sverige and its subsidiaries
for the period to the consolidated financial information of Lowell AS and its subsidiaries for the period. For the three-months ended
March 31, 2018, the unaudited consolidated results of Lowell Sverige and its subsidiaries and the unaudited consolidated results
of Lowell AS and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with IFRS and Norwegian GAAP, respectively. As such, Lowell
Sverige’s and Lowell AS’s respective accounting policies and treatments and financial definitions may differ from each other and
those of the Group for such period. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated
_Financial Information.”_

(b) The Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information reflects the following adjustments: (i) the assets and liabilities of the
Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS and their subsidiaries were recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations),
requiring purchase price adjustments to certain assets, primarily existing customer relationships and owned debt portfolios; (ii) the
ERC curves of the Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS and their subsidiaries’ owned debt portfolios were adjusted from 180-months to
120-months; (iii) finance costs were adjusted as if the 2018 Acquisitions, including the issuance of the Existing Hansa Notes and
other related financing transactions, had occurred on January 1, 2018; and (iv) income tax (expense) / credit was adjusted in
accordance with the above. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial
_Information.”_

_Income from portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments increased by £37.8 million, or 11.1%, to £377.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from £339.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a 3.6%
increase in portfolio purchases to £397.3 million as at December 31, 2019 from £383.6 million as at December
31, 2018 and the full 2019 year impact of the 2018 Acquisitions.


-----

_Net portfolio write-up_

Net portfolio write-up increased by £18.7 million, or 14.8%, to £144.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from £126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due
to strong collection performance on the backbook during the period, driven by an increase in litigation activity
and targeted collection activity within older vintages unlocking additional value whilst also implementing other
operational initiatives. This has led to an increase in net portfolio write-up for the period ended December 2019,
compared to December 2018.

_Portfolio fair value release_

Portfolio fair value release decreased by £0.4 million, or 20.0%, to £1.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from £2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Portfolio fair value adjustments are
made as part of the purchase price allocations when the Group acquires other companies. These adjust the value
of the portfolio to fair value. The portfolio fair value release represents the unwinding of the fair value uplift. The
decrease is primarily due to the unwinding of the fair value uplift on portfolio valuation of the UK Division at the
time of the acquisition of the Lowell Group. There was greater release in the early years due to the front loaded
nature of the ERC curve, which was used as the basis for the release.

_Service revenue_

Service revenue increased by £14.7 million, or 7.2%, to £218.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 from £204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to the full 2019 year
impact of the 2018 Acquisitions which has been offset by a loss in revenue from the sale of the payments division
in Northern Europe in 2018.

_Collection activity costs_

Collection activity costs increased by £42.6 million, or 14.2%, to £342.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from £299.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased
collection activity across both debt purchase and debt servicing divisions and the full 2019 year impact of the
2018 Acquisitions.

_Other expenses_

Other expenses increased by £17.5 million, or 7.4%, to £253.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 from £235.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to a full 2019 year
impact of the 2018 Acquisitions, partially offset by the Group’s activities to reduce cost.

_Finance income_

Finance income increased by £4.4 million to £6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from
£1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a £3.9 million gain made by the Group
following the repurchase of £33.5 million of the existing senior unsecured notes in August 2019. The net effect
of currency exchange movements on finance income was a gain of £1.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Finance costs_

Finance costs increased by £28.1 million, or 14.3%, to £224.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 from £195.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase reflects an increase in gross debt
drawn during 2018. This includes a full 12 months of the Existing €530 million 2023 Euro Notes and the Existing
2023 SEK Notes associated with the 2018 Acquisitions and the impact of overall net debt increase under the Luigi
Securitization and Revolving Credit Facility during 2019 to support the business growth. The net effect of
currency exchange movements on finance costs was nil for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to loss
of £1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Income tax credit_

Income tax credit increased by £4.9 million, or 213.0%, to £7.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 from £2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in loss for the period
and a reduction in the tax losses carried forward.

_Consolidated Statement of Financial Position_

_Portfolio Investments_

Portfolio investments increased by £596.5 million, or 61.8%, as of December 31, 2018 as compared to
December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due the to the completion of the 2018 Acquisition and increased
portfolio purchases driven by the overall larger scale of the Group. Currency exchange movements accounted for
a £10.5 million increase in portfolio investments between December 31, 2018 and 2017.

- The income statement figures for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in this table are derived from the 2018 Group Consolidated
Financial Statements where the prior year comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 were retrospectively
adjusted to reclassify net portfolio write-up under income for consistency with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2018
following the adoption of IFRS 9. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies—
_Reclassification of prior year presentation” to the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements._

_Income from portfolio investments._

Income from portfolio investments increased by £94.2 million, or 38.4%, to £339.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 from £245.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase
in portfolio investments. Portfolio investments increased by £596.5 million, or 61.8%, between December 31,
2017 and December 31, 2018 to £1,561.0 million. This was due primarily to the 2018 Acquisitions, which
contributed £387.5 million to portfolio investments upon completion.

_Net portfolio write-up_

Net portfolio write-up increased by £24.2 million, or 23.7%, to £126.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 from £101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to strong collection
on assets owned in the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Portfolio fair value release_

Portfolio fair value release increased by £0.6 million, or 23.1%, to £2.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 from £2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the unwinding of
the fair value uplift on portfolio valuation of the UK Division at the time of the acquisition of the Lowell Group.
There was greater release in the early years due to the front loaded nature of the ERC curve, which was used as
the basis for the release.


-----

_Service revenue_

Service revenue increased by £39.2 million, or 23.8%, to £204.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2018 from £164.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to an increase in third-party debt under
management, primarily as a result of the 2018 Acquisitions, which in turn increased the amount of commissions
received from our service of third-party debt.

_Collection activity costs_

Collection activity costs increased by £61.3 million, or 25.7%, to £299.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 from £238.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher levels of
collection activity and increasing levels of portfolios held due to larger Group operations.

_Other expenses_

Other expenses increased by £69.7 million, or 42.0%, to £235.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 from £166.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the increased scale of the business
following the 2018 Acquisitions and related infrastructure and operating costs.

_Finance income_

Finance income decreased by £0.6 million to £1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from
£2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a £1.8 million premium release on existing
debt in the year ended December 31, 2017.

_Finance costs_

Finance costs increased by £19.8 million, or 11.2%, to £195.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 from £176.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased interest expenses and
fees on the Existing Notes, related to higher debt levels following the 2018 Acquisitions.

_Income tax (expense) / credit_

Income tax expense decreased by £4.1 million, to a £2.3 million credit for the year ended December 31,
2018 from a £1.8 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the impact of tax losses
carried forward, partly offset by the change in value of deferred taxes.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Historically, the Group’s liquidity requirements consisted mainly of debt and tax servicing requirements,
funding of its purchases of debt portfolios and acquisitions, capital expenditure and working capital. The Group’s
principal sources of liquidity have been funds raised in connection with bond offerings, its cash flow generated
by operations (before portfolio acquisition costs), borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, securitizations
of owned debt portfolios such under the Luigi Securitization and the Milla Securitization, and shareholder loans.

While the Group’s collections have historically been predictable throughout the year, its debt purchase
activity can vary greatly from one quarter to the next. This is driven by the timing of one-off debt sales by vendors
during the year, the timing of which the Group does not control, along with its own desire to purchase a portfolio
at a given point in time. This could lead to volatility in the Group’s cash balances quarter on quarter.

The Group’s ability to generate cash from operations depends on its future operating performance, which
is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other
factors, many of which are beyond its control, as well as other factors discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.”

We believe that the combined operating cash flows of the Group, together with the cash resources and
future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our debt and tax servicing
requirements as they become due, working capital requirements and anticipated debt purchases, although this may
not be the case. In particular, future drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will only be available if, among
other things, we meet the financial covenant included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”


-----

As of June 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our liquidity and capital
resources. However, as a result of COVID-19, global financial markets have experienced overall volatility and
disruptions to capital and credit markets. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our
operations and how that may impact our cash flows and our ability to settle debt. As of June 30, 2020, on a pro
_forma basis to reflect the Offering and the uses of proceeds therefrom, up to €445 million would have been_
available for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility on a committed basis. As of the Issue
Date, we expect we will have the equivalent of £      million drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility
(compared to £403.4 million as of June 30, 2020). If necessary, we may increase the utilization of our Revolving
Credit Facility in the future to further improve our cash position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or for
other purposes. We may also increase the utilization of our Milla Securitization and Luigi Securitization programs
or enter into one or more additional securitization transactions to further improve our cash position. As of the date
of this Offering Memorandum, we have no plans to increase the utilization of these programs or to enter into any
such transactions. See “Summary—Recent Developments—COVID-19” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business and Industry—Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19_
_outbreak or other similar outbreaks.”_

**_Cash Flow from Operating Activities for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 Compared to the Six Months_**

**Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.................................................** 306.9 126.3

_Net cash generated from operating activities_

The net cash inflow from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was £94.5 million,
as compared to £7.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in the level of
portfolio acquisitions.

_Net cash generated from investing activities_

The net cash outflow from investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was £10.0 million,
as compared to £9.7 million for six months ended June 30, 2019. This marginal increase compared to the
comparison period was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of a subsidiary in 2019 more than
offsetting what was an overall decrease in the level of purchases of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) and
intangibles.

_Net cash generated from financing activities_

The net cash inflow from financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was £90.4 million,
as compared to an outflow of £0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This change was primarily due
to the action taken to increase the utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility in order to increase our cash position
as a prudent liquidity measure in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Net cash generated from operating activities_

The net cash inflow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was £37.4 million,
as compared to an outflow of £27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in
collections, partially offset by increases in portfolios acquired.

_Net cash generated from investing activities_

The net cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was £23.4 million,
as compared to £598.7 million for year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the 2018
Acquisitions purchase cost of £595.0 million included in the 2018 results.

_Net cash generated from financing activities_

The net cash outflow used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was £13.4
million, as compared to an inflow of £689.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was
primarily due to the additional financing incurred in 2018 for the settlement of the 2018 Acquisitions.

The net cash outflow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was £27.9 million,
as compared to £34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased collections, which
were offset by increased portfolio acquisition costs and finance costs.

_Net cash generated from investing activities_

The net cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was £598.7 million,
as compared to £4.9 million for year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in cash outflow was primarily due
to the 2018 Acquisitions.

_Net cash generated from financing activities_

The net cash inflow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was £689.9 million,
as compared to £4.5 million inflow for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due


-----

issuance of Existing €530 million 2023 Euro Notes and the Existing 2023 SEK Notes associated with the 2018
Acquisitions.

**_Capital Expenditure_**

The Group’s capital expenditure consisted mainly of: (i) IT hardware, (ii) IT software and development,
(iii) leasehold improvements, (iv) fixtures and fittings and (v) office equipment. Our estimated maintenance
capital expenditure requirement (being the run-rate capital expenditure required in a hypothetical ERC
maintenance scenario) is £0.6 million per year, as of the date of the Offering Memorandum.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group spent £4.9 million on the purchase of property, plant
and equipment and £18.9 million on the purchase of intangible assets, which are primarily software and software
development costs. The Group has budgeted capital expenditure of £25.7 million for the year ending December
31, 2020.

As of June 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had not had a material impact on our capital expenditures.
Our response to the spread of COVID-19 was to transition 95% of our workforce to remote working by April 17,
2020 and our expectation is that a significant proportion of our workforce will continue to work remotely for the
foreseeable future. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we expect that our capital expenditure for the
year ending December 31, 2020 will increase by approximately £1.3 million due to COVID-19 and will primarily
be incurred in the second quarter. This anticipated increase in capital expenditure primarily is primarily due to IT
infrastructure and security costs related to our shift to remote working.

We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and how that may
impact our cash flows and our ability to make capital expenditures in our business. See also “Summary—Recent
_Developments—COVID-19” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business and_
_results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.”_

**_Working Capital_**

The Group’s working capital requirements have historically been low and typically consistent throughout
the year. Furthermore, the Group has few supplier contracts, and therefore low and stable current debtors and
creditors.

The Group’s cash flow conversion for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to 91.2% compared
to 84.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by a large, non-recurring purchase of
intangible assets in 2018 in connection with the 2018 Acquisitions. Our working capital requirements have
remained largely stable during the relevant periods.

As of June 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had not had a material impact on our working capital
needs and, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our
working capital needs. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and how
that may impact our cash flows and our working capital needs. See also “Summary—Recent Developments—
_COVID-19” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business and results of_
_operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.”_

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Our Market, Financial and Other Risk**

The presentation of our results of operations may be affected by the translation of foreign currencies into
pounds sterling for the purpose of our consolidated financial statements. To the extent that foreign exchange rate
exposures are not hedged, fluctuations in currencies may adversely or positively affect our financial results in
ways unrelated to our operations. Any of these adverse developments could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

We are exposed to changes in interest rates because we finance certain operations through both fixed and
variable rate debt instruments. Changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings. We
manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the
use of derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes.

By using derivative instruments, we are subject to credit and market risk. The fair market value of the
derivative instruments is determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market- observable


-----

inputs, including interest rate yield curves, and reflects the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting
period. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty has an obligation to pay us, thus
creating a receivable risk. We are also exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by
counterparties to our derivative agreements. We seek to minimize counterparty credit (or repayment) risk by
entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. Our exposure to
market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on
earnings or cash flow.

As of June 30, 2020, the Group had financial derivatives assets held at fair value in the amount of £1.3
million and financial derivative liability of £3.2 million.

**_Brexit_**

We believe our exposure to risks related to Brexit, both during and following the Transition Period, in
the markets in which we operate takes four primary forms: (i) risks related to changes in laws and regulations, (ii)
risks posed by potential volatility in foreign exchange rates, (iii) the risk that Brexit could result in a deterioration
of general economic conditions and (iv) the risk that Brexit could reduce our access to the European and other
markets. The legal and regulatory environment post-Brexit is inherently uncertain, yet we believe the regulatory
regimes in our markets have achieved a level of maturity and stability that may mitigate this risk. However should
the UK and EU regulatory regimes diverge, then this could limit our ability to operate in a manner consistent with
past practice and increase operating and compliance costs particularly in regards to the ability to transfer personal
data.

With respect to the macroeconomic environment of the UK and Europe, if Brexit were to trigger a
recession or period of prolonged economic uncertainty, management believes the effect on our business would be
mixed. While an economic downturn may reduce our consumers’ ability to pay, the sustainability of a majority
of our payment plans as well as the countervailing effects of declining interest rates on our consumers’ variable
rate debt burden may mitigate this effect. Furthermore, a recession may increase the volume of non-performing
loans in the market and provide us with more purchasing and contingent placement opportunities. Additionally,
our ERCs are generally front-loaded, with approximately 34% of the UK Division’s collections realized in the
first 24 months of the ERC curve (acting as a natural hedge against deteriorating economic conditions). Although
Brexit presents an unprecedented set of changes, our performance during the most recent economic downturn
leads management to believe that its business is well-positioned. In addition, we do not operate across borders,
which reduces our exposure to any adverse consequences relating to market access within the European Union.
In terms of the assets owned as at December 31, 2007, our UK Division outperformed its collections forecast as
at this date both during the period 2008 to 2010, and thereafter to the current date, demonstrating both the
resilience of the business and the accuracy of our ERC forecasting.

For more information on the risks posed by Brexit, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business
_and Industry—The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic_
_conditions, financial markets and our business.”_

**_COVID-19_**

Although the extent to which COVID-19 will impact us remains uncertain due to numerous evolving
factors that we are unable to predict, we believe that the primary risks that we are exposed to in relation to the
COVID-19 pandemic are (i) the risk that we may be unable to perform necessary business functions, (ii) risks
related to our collections, (iii) the risk that our owned debt portfolios deteriorate in quality due to the impact of
COVID-19 and related effects on our consumers, which in turn results in revaluations of our owned debt portfolios
and (iv) the risk that the pandemic causes a prolonged deterioration of general economic conditions.

Although the pandemic has not had a material effect on our operational capabilities as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, it has adversely affected our Gross Debt Purchase Collections year to date, and we expect
to continue to experience delays on a portion of our near-term collections on owned debt portfolios. As a result,
we expect our Gross Debt Purchase Collections in 2020 to fall short of previous estimates. In the three months
ended June 30, 2020, we recognized an £11.0 million net portfolio write down, representing 0.7% of the Group’s
Portfolio Book Value, and it cannot be ruled out that impairments will impact our net portfolio write-up for future
periods. If COVID-19 continues to spread or increases in virulence, it may disrupt our ability to maintain necessary
staffing levels, limit our ability to perform collection activities due to disruptions to the court system or
governmental actions limiting debt collection efforts or disrupt other key operational activities.


-----

In order to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on expectations of future collections, we consider historical
performance, current collection activity, current economic forecasts regarding the duration of the impact to shortterm and long-term growth in our core markets, evolving information regarding government stimulus packages
and the effects of reduced economic activity resulting from the imposition of stay-at-home orders and social
distancing guidelines. Based on these factors, we assess our estimated future cash flows and review our owned
debt portfolios for indications of impairment in accordance with the IFRS 9 forward-looking expected credit loss
(“ECL”) model. Such impairments are recognized in net portfolio write-up in our statement of comprehensive
income. Our assumptions regarding the duration and impact of COVID-19 to future collections could change
significantly as conditions evolve.

For more information on the risks posed by COVID-19, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business and Industry—Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19_
_outbreak or other similar outbreak.”_

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a consumer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual payment obligations. Credit risk exposure is the carrying amount of financial assets recorded
in the consolidated financial statements, which are net of impairment losses. The Group’s most significant
exposure to credit risk is its portfolio investments.

The risk from the concentration of consumer credit risk is limited due to the high number of individual
consumers and the relatively low value of each of the individual’s debts. As of June 30, 2020, the average account
balance in our UK Division’s owned debt portfolios was £703, the average account balance in our DACH
Division’s owned debt portfolios was €934.37, the average account balance in our DACH Division’s 3PC serviced
portfolios was €1,945.80, the average account balance in our Northern European Division’s owned debt portfolios
was €2,330.14 and the average account balance in our Northern European Division’s 3PC serviced portfolios was
€1,886.74. We believe that our low average monthly payments and the fact that our consumers are typically
already in financial distress or unemployed have provided some degree of protection against changes in its
consumers’ disposable income.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility, amounts drawn thereunder bear interest at a floating
rate. Additionally, certain intercompany loans, the Floating Rate Euro Notes and the Existing Hansa Notes will
bear interest at a floating rate. In each instance the applicable rate of interest is or, in the case of the Floating Rate
Euro Notes, will be based on a specified benchmark interest rate that varies according to market conditions.
Accordingly, if market conditions cause these benchmark interest rates to increase, our interest expense in respect
of the Notes and amounts drawn under our Revolving Credit Facilities would also increase. As of June 30, 2020,
the Revolving Credit Facility was drawn at the euro equivalent of £403.4 million. As of the Issue Date, we expect
we will have the equivalent of £      million drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Financial Profile—The Notes and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear_
_interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow.”_

**_Significant Accounting Issues_**

IFRS 16 Leases became effective on January 1, 2019, and was implemented by the Group in 2019. IFRS
16 establishes reforms for lease accounting for lessees, eliminating the categorization of leases as either finance
leases or operating leases. All leases are now treated as finance leases were treated under IFRS 17 for accounting
purposes.

**Introduction to the CMS Industry**

Debt is created when a debt originator extends credit to a person, who in turn becomes a customer of that
debt originator. Such arrangements include financial institutions extending loans or trade sector companies issuing
invoices for services rendered or goods delivered (e.g., retail and telecommunications companies or public-sector
entities, among others). Debtors default on their payment obligations when they do not repay the debt according
to the terms on which it was extended, which results in the debt becoming overdue. Defaulted debt is an inherent
feature of unsecured lending. Debt originators typically expect a certain percentage of consumers to default and,
accordingly, manage their pricing to a target default level. Defaulted debt may be collected by the debt originator
itself, by a law firm on behalf of the debt originator or by a Credit Management Services (CMS) company, such
as the Group.

Debt, whether it is overdue or not, may be collected by either the originator itself or by a third-party to
whom the originator has either sold the debt or merely outsourced its collection. For many debt originators, the
management of defaulted debt is a low priority or non-core activity because volumes of defaulted debt are small
relative to the overall scale of lending and debt originators do not generally invest much capital in their respective
collection systems. Accordingly, outsourcing the collection of defaulted debt to a CMS company is an attractive
option for many debt originators. Depending on the debt originators’ preferences and objectives, a CMS company
either manages the defaulted debt on behalf of the debt originator according to a servicing agreement, or purchases
the defaulted debt from the debt originator, thereby taking legal ownership of the debt and acquiring the right to
collect on it for its own account. The Group purchases defaulted debt and manages defaulted debt on behalf of
third-party debt originators.

Our geographical footprint comprises some of the largest consumer credit markets in Europe, including
the UK, Germany and Northern Europe, with a leading presence in Austria as well. The following chart illustrates
the relative maturity profile of the CMS industry in our markets as compared to the CMS industry in other key
international markets. As the chart indicates, both the UK and Northern Europe, given the large scale of their
economies and overall levels of indebtedness, and Germany and Austria given attractive growth profiles, provide
opportunities for greater debt collection outsourcing and debt portfolio sales.

**Illustrative Relative Development of Key Debt Recovery Markets**

Typical stages of development of debt purchase markets

Sales of non-performing loans in Europe had been increasing since 2014, peaking in 2018 at £182.0
billion, and regulatory changes are continuing to encourage banks to dispose of non-performing loans. For
example, in December 2018 the European Council issued new regulations on non-performing loans in Europe that
implemented an increased risk-weighting of unsecured non-performing loans in the calculation of risk-weighted
assets to 150%. Furthermore, in January 2019, the European Council published a final compromise text for
updated non-performing loan regulations, to establish a prudential backstop. The new regulations expanded on
existing legislation by requiring bank entities to fully write down unsecured non-performing loans after three
years and secured NPLs after seven years. Further, in March 2019, the European Council’s position on a proposed
directive which harmonizes rules for how non-credit institutions can buy credit agreements from banks was
approved. With these proposals, the Council aims to create a prudential framework for banks to deal with new
non-performing loans and thus reduce the risk of accumulation in the future, potentially further emphasizing
incentives for higher nonperforming loan sales. As a result of COVID-19, loan loss provisions made by the 20
largest European banks increased by more than three times in the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of
2019, potentially creating a large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets across Europe that will
be affected by these regulatory changes.

**Credit Lifecycle**

CMS is an established part of the credit lifecycle in the UK, Germany and Northern Europe. There are a
number of stages in the debt lifecycle and CMS companies offer several services to clients throughout the cycle.
The debt recovery cycles in the UK, German and Northern European markets are broadly similar in their
components. However, the relative importance of third-party collection versus debt purchase and the timing of
third parties’ involvement in the recovery cycle tend to differ between these markets. While, in the UK, a portfolio
is often sold following at least one DCA placement, in Germany, debt sale and third-party collection are often
viewed as alternatives to recovering on defaulted debt and in Northern Europe, the CMS market is highly mature
with, on average, a significantly higher volume of debt outsourced to be managed on third-party basis compared
to the rest of Europe (~60% in Northern Europe compared to ~45% in the rest of Europe, based on a 2017 third
party report).

The debt recovery cycle encompasses the following steps:

    - **Origination of debt. A consumer obtains credit from a debt originator. The financial services**
sector has historically been one of the largest sources of credit for consumers, but short- or longterm consumer credit is also a core component of business models across many other sectors,
including telecommunications, retail, utilities and e-commerce.


-----

    - **Default. A consumer defaults on his or her payment obligations. For example, the consumer may**
fail to make a series of scheduled payments. This may happen because of a change in the
consumer’s circumstances (e.g., the loss of a job) or because the consumer entered into debt
arrangements that prove unmanageable.

    - **In-house recovery. The debt originator uses its internal resources to attempt to recover the**
defaulted debt. Debt originators typically have standard procedures that apply when a consumer
account falls into arrears, which include the use of internal recovery strategies and in-house debt
collection activity to attempt to rehabilitate consumer accounts. Regularly, debt originators either
fail to make contact with the consumer or are unable to reach an acceptable agreement on a
payment.

    - **Engagement of CMS. Defaulted debt portfolios are serviced by third parties for a fee. The legal**
ownership and balance-sheet exposure remain with the debt originators. CMS companies provide
debt collection services to debt originators for overdue debt. Litigation techniques are often used
when the consumer’s ability to pay has been demonstrated but the consumer is unwilling to pay.

    - **Debt sale. Defaulted debt portfolios are sold to third parties at a significant discount to the**
principal value of the debt. The legal ownership and balance-sheet exposure are thereby transferred
to the debt purchasers.

    - **Other CMS. In the UK, Germany and Northern Europe, CMS companies are increasingly active**
throughout the recovery process. End-to-end recovery management provides growth opportunities
for such companies, for instance, in early-stage recovery (e.g., prior to the consumer’s default).
Before debt originators extend credit to consumers, CMS companies can also provide credit
scoring and other forms of credit information services, such as data extraction and modelling.
CMS companies also provide payment processing services, including invoice administration,
subsidiary ledger accounting, invoice printing, payment reminders and consumer checks related to
the ability to make purchases on account. These services can be provided either before or after
debt is defaulted and, in certain cases, before the debt originator-customer relationship is first
created (i.e., before a consumer purchase takes place).

The chart below gives an overview of the debt recovery cycle.

**Typical Debt Lifecycle and Credit Management Services**

**CMS Business Models**

The primary sub-segments of the CMS industry are addressed below:

**Debt Purchasing**

Debt purchasing entails the sale of financial debt by a debt originator to a specialist debt purchaser or
investor who acquires the right to collect the debt for its own account and retain the cash collected. The purchaser
then typically seeks to reinvest this cash, net of collection costs, in acquisitions of new debt portfolios. Originators


-----

may sell portfolios of performing or non-performing loans to CMS companies for a number of reasons relating to
operational and economic efficiency. Selling non-performing loans enables originators to, among other things,
increase liquidity, strengthen their balance sheets, liberate internal resources to focus on core competencies and
reduce back office costs associated with their in-house collection infrastructure. Debt originators generally choose
to sell performing loans for similar reasons, though this can also be due to a decision to withdraw from a particular
product or geography which is no longer profitable or core to their future strategy.

_Debt Sale Pricing: Paying vs. Non-Paying Accounts_

In general, prices are lower for accounts that have been in default for extended periods or have passed
through several DCA placement cycles due to lower than expected recovery rates compared to prices for defaulted
accounts that are currently making regular payments (often below contractual terms). Generally, a DP will acquire
non-paying debt (in various states of delinquency) at a price heavily discounted from the face value of the debt,
while prices for paying debt are typically higher compared to prices for non-paying debt. In the case of paying
accounts, DPs acquire annuity-like cash flow streams (even if payments are less than the contracted amount under
the terms of the original indebtedness), while for non-paying accounts, they need to make contact with the
customer and establish a sustainable and affordable repayment plan. Making contact, and agreeing a repayment
plan, with the customer is generally difficult for accounts that have been in default longer, and this is therefore
reflected in the lower pricing of such accounts. This drives the variance in indicative pricing for various types of
non-paying accounts and paying accounts.

_Methods of Debt Sale_

Debt originators may structure their sales of debt portfolios in one of the following ways:

    - _Off-market sales / bilateral agreements: Financial institutions generally use off-market_
transactions to simplify the sale process, where the transaction size does not justify running a
competitive process or for the sale of complex portfolios. In off-market sales, the vendor originator
considers just one party for the sale (typically a well-reputed and trusted partner with which it has
a long-standing relationship), and if the price offered by the buyer is considered appropriate, the
vendor originator sells the debt portfolio to the buyer without inviting any other bidders.

    - _Limited auction: For the sale of portfolios with a relatively high level of complexity, vendor_
originators will often typically invite a few bidders to a tender process, which involves a greater
level of more manual loan file due diligence.

    - _Broad auction: For the sale of some classes of debt, vendor originators will often initiate widely_
competitive tender processes, including five to six bidders or more. The relevant portfolios are
generally priced by bidders using statistical models, and are often broken down into segments,
with each segment being sold to the highest bidder. Such auctions become more difficult when
portfolios are more complex and data quality is poor, including in less mature markets.

    - _Forward flow agreements: These involve agreements to sell several similar debt portfolios over a_
period of time at a predetermined price and for a specified quality of debt, avoiding fluctuations
caused by changes in macroeconomic conditions and outcomes of precedent auctions. In general,
we are protected against downside risk in debt quality through provisions in the forward flow
agreements. In the case of our UK forward flow agreements, there is flexibility to modify pricing
upon a detailed review of the portfolios. Similarly, in the case of our German forward flow
agreements, we are protected through put back mechanisms and certain representations and
warranties from the seller, and typically in the case of the Northern European Division’s forward
flow agreements, through the ability to re-negotiate, re-price (in combination with a termination
right of the counterparty) and terminate in case of a change in the counterparty’s credit decision
policy or credit issuing process.

**Debt Servicing**

Debt servicing is a service provided by a CMS company that collects financial debt on behalf of a third
global party (typically the debt originator). Servicers generally receive a fee related either to the face value of the
debt portfolios they manage or the collections generated, depending on the nature of the managed portfolio. CMS
companies may provide debt collection services to debt originators for either performing or non-performing debt.
Collections of non-performing debt can be particularly burdensome for debt originators because it can be time


-----

consuming and costly, especially when compared to specialists who have the key competencies and experience
and are appropriately structured to do so more efficiently. Additionally, debt originators may choose to outsource
the collection of some of their accounts to a CMS company with a view to assess the performance of their internal
debt recovery performance operations. Collection of performing debt may be outsourced because of a desire to
reduce back office or IT costs (to turn fixed overhead costs into variable costs) or to benefit from economies of
scale that can be offered by CMS companies.

_Methods of Debt Servicing_

The terms and the fee structure of a servicing agreement typically depend on whether it concerns the
servicing of non-performing or performing loans and type of debt, whether consumer or corporate, secured or
unsecured, etc.

_NPL service agreements: Debt servicing agreements for outsourced NPLs typically have a defined_
minimum term with tacit renewal and at least a three-month termination notice by either party. Service agreements
for non-performing loans can take a wide variety of forms with specific guidelines regarding reporting obligations,
thresholds for debt forgiveness and guidelines regarding incurrence of costs. Service agreements for nonperforming loans also tend to have customary confidentiality, compliance and data privacy clauses, as well as an
audit clause and limitation of financial responsibility for the servicer.

_Performing debt service agreements: Debt servicing agreements for performing debt typically have a_
stated term commensurate with the remaining life of the portfolio but can be terminated with an advance notice.
Performing debt servicing agreements typically include either a flat fee per month and/or per loan which varies
depending upon the size, duration and nature of the debt, or a variable fee based on assets under management,
which also varies depending upon the size, duration and nature of the claims. Service agreements for performing
debt tend to have customary confidentiality, compliance and data privacy clauses, as well as a service level
agreement and an audit clause that permits the bank to monitor the quality of the provider’s services. Typically,
these agreements also limit the financial responsibility for the servicer.

CMS companies have also sought to increasingly target a wider breadth of credit active customers earlier
in the value chain, through the provision of an enhanced range of value-added services before loans and
receivables are overdue. These services typically include:

    - Invoicing: The client can outsource its accounts receivable process, including collection activity.
This is a particularly reliable and cost efficient solution for clients with high invoicing volumes

    - Payment: This enables retailers and other consumer companies to make a real time credit decision
at the time of purchase, and gives them the ability to offer customers payment through invoice or a
part payment solution. The CMS company manages the entire credit process, from scoring and
credit decision to processing and distributing invoices

    - Information services: This typically includes credit analysis, data extraction and modelling, as well
as selection and scoring of potential customers. These solutions help clients mitigate potential
losses from new customers with reliable and efficient information on their credit worthiness

**Overview of Key Selection Criteria for Debt Originators**

Key selection criteria for creditors in selecting a BPO/DCA or DP counterparty are as follows:

    - **Compliance: With a tightening regulatory environment in consumer credit and growing concerns**
around reputational risk, originators are increasingly seeing compliance as a key criterion for entry
onto their panel of pre-approved BPO/DCA or DP counterparty. DCAs and DPs are subject to
substantial due-diligence before entering into consideration.

    - **Customer treatment: Good customer experience, particularly in regards to dealings with**
vulnerable customers, is a fundamental requirement. This has become increasingly important as
regulation has tightened in this area (e.g., the FCA’s principles in relation to treating customers
fairly).

    - **Relationships: Buyer relationships are also highly important considerations for debt originator**
panels. The significant cost in oversight means that creditors are increasingly looking to establish
long-term relationships with a select set of DCA/DPs.


-----

    - **Price: Once included on the panel, price is often, but not always, the key factor in winning a debt**
sale or BPO/DCA role.

    - **Ability to execute and operational capabilities: In awarding a mandate, credibility and proven**
ability to execute are key for creditors. The operational capability of the BPO/DCA or DP to
satisfy on-going requirements (reporting, compliance, etc.) is also an important factor.

**Overview of Key Market Sectors**

There are different ways to classify the defaulted consumer debt available for purchase or servicing. For
example, such debt may be classified by its quality. Key drivers of the quality of debt, and therefore its price,
include its age, its average balance and the level of difficulty in contacting its consumer base. Accordingly, CMS
companies may, for instance, classify consumer debt by its stage in the debt-recovery cycle. Credit card asset
classes, for example, typically vary from fresh write-offs (i.e., accounts that have generally not been placed with
DCAs at the time of sale) to accounts that have remained defaulted for a longer period of time prior to being
outsourced, and CMS companies may focus on one or more of such classes. Furthermore debts may be classified
by the industry they originate from in order to leverage the predictive power of industry specific consumer
behavior.

Consumer debt may also be classified by market sector as below:

**Size and Attractions of the UK, German and Northern European CMS Markets**

The UK, Germany and Northern Europe are amongst the largest European producers of annual NPL
volumes across industries, driven by the size of their respective economies and consumer credit markets. The UK
with £224.1 billion in consumer credit outstanding, Germany with £171.1 billion in consumer credit outstanding
and Northern Europe in aggregate, with £157.6 billion in consumer credit outstanding are amongst the largest
consumer credit markets in Europe as of December 2019. (Source: Bank of England, European Central Bank,
Swedish Central Bank, Danish Central Bank and Norges Bank).

**_UK_**

The CMS market was established in the UK in the late 1990s following the success of more established
markets in the United States and Scandinavia, and has grown considerably since then. This market was initially
developed as a method for debt originators to manage defaulted loans and to accelerate capital release for defaulted
debt, the value of which had already been significantly written down. The market commenced with small-scale
transactions by CMS companies that generally had access to small funding lines.

The UK debt purchase market underwent significant growth from 2000 to 2008, fueled by a rapid rise in
outstanding consumer debt together with increasing default rates. The onset of the financial crisis in 2008 resulted
in a substantial withdrawal of funding supply from the debt purchasers operating in the sector and an increased
cost of funding for those debt purchasers that remained active. Reduced funding supply, coupled with a difficult
collections environment in which debt purchasers were no longer able to agree settlements with borrowers,
resulted in the exit of many debt purchasers from the market. Since 2010, however, the UK debt purchase market
has experienced a recovery and is now one of the largest defaulted consumer debt markets in Europe.

Today, the debt purchase and collection industry has become an integral component of the debt recovery
process in the UK and helps UK debt originators manage the asset quality in their loan portfolios. This has become
particularly important as capital and liquidity requirements imposed by regulators and investors increase.
Increasingly, CMS companies have also become an important tool for non-financial debt originators, such as
telecommunications and retail companies (as described below), to outsource the management of their bad debt
and focus on their core businesses.

The UK consumer credit market is a large and mature market for debt purchases, which, since the
beginning of 2010, has returned to growth, driven by availability of funding and the increasing willingness of debt
originators to sell debt given increasing pressure to reduce the costs of holding and managing defaulted debt. The
industry has also come under increased scrutiny, primarily as a result of high levels of indebtedness affecting
many individuals in the United Kingdom, which ultimately led to debt collection activity falling under the
authority of the FCA in 2014. The sale of “fresher” debt has led to increasingly larger deal sizes, particularly in
the United Kingdom. This has been a key factor in driving industry consolidation, with the larger more established
players accessing new sources of funding and also benefiting from economies of scale.

As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of non-performing loans outstanding was approximately
£47.7 billion in the United Kingdom representing an NPL ratio of 1.3%. We believe the United Kingdom market
has a strong pipeline, with approximately £6.7 billion completed in 2018, £10.0 billion completed in 2019, and
we expect to continue to pursue attractive opportunities to acquire loan portfolios in the United Kingdom. The
level of consumer credit in the United Kingdom stood at £224.1 billion as at December 2019, with new flows of
£13.2 billion during the year.


-----

_Attractions of the UK CMS Market_

    - **Increasing concentration. In recent years, we believe that there has been a trend towards**
increased concentration of the UK CMS industry around a small core group of leading CMS
companies and debt purchasers. Industry consolidation has been further supported by the
tightening supply of credit globally during the financial crisis, with only the most experienced and
reputable market participants being able to secure the necessary financing to support an active debt
collection and debt acquisition program during that period. All the large participants in the UK
debt purchase market have recently raised debt through high-yield bond issuances, which gives
them more stable medium-term financing as compared to other smaller participants, thereby
facilitating further industry consolidation.

    - **Increasing tendency to sell. Moreover, management expect that the propensity on the part of UK**
debt originators to sell debt portfolios earlier in the recovery process will continue. Debt
originators increasingly tend to outsource the recovery of defaulted debt on account of their lack of
internal resources, the desire to focus internal resources on core activities, the increased
compliance cost and regulatory risk associated with increased regulation and the generally better
cost structure of CMS companies. CMS companies offer a wide range of services, providing debt
originators with a comprehensive solution for the management of delinquent debt that extracts
higher value from their NPLs.

    - **Emerging market sectors. In the UK, the utilities, insurance and public sectors have historically**
accounted for a relatively small proportion of debt purchase and debt collection revenue as
compared to the financial services, telecommunications and retail sectors. We believe these sectors
represent new sources of supply for UK CMS companies.

**_DACH_**

_Attractions of the German CMS Market_

The German CMS industry matured from 2003-2007 after an economic downturn in the early 2000s
when banks sold and outsourced the collection of a large amount of overdue debt. Activity decreased during the
financial crisis from 2008-2010 before recovering in 2011. We believe that German debt originators across various
sectors have a high propensity to outsource early in the credit cycle (i.e., after the due date, but before the debt
becomes overdue by 45 days or, in the financial services sector generally, by 90 days), due to the limited presence
of in-house collection operations at German debt originators.

    - **Supportive environment for outsourced CMS. Due to the limited in-house resources of many**
debt originators in Germany, CMS companies benefit from a large supply of outsourced debt. The
trend is expected to continue due to the cost cutting pressure on German banks. Furthermore, the
number of potential debt collectors chosen by a specific company tends to be small (which we
believe to be one to three collectors, on average) for third-party collections and services, providing
an opportunity to build partnership-like relationships with debt originators early in the recovery
cycle.

    - **Wide range of revenue opportunities and longer time to work on debt. Debt is outsourced**
relatively early through BPO services prior to its due date, and outsourced collections and debt
sales generally start 45 days after the respective due dates of the obligations. This “fresh” debt
typically is of higher quality and has higher collection expectations, because less work has been
applied to the assets to obtain consumer payments. Furthermore, it is possible to engage in longterm monitoring to identify potential solvency changes of consumers for up to 30 years (and, in
some cases, for a longer period) in line with the applicable statute of limitations. Earlier access to
debt and longer-term monitoring provide wider opportunities to capture fees and allow for more
time to recover debt.

    - **Cultural attitudes towards debt repayment. German consumers tend to use debt for payments to**
a substantially lesser degree than consumers in other European countries, preferring to instead use
cash and debit cards. The low comparative usage of credit in Germany could be driven by the
additional fees charged to defaulted consumers, as well as by cultural attitudes towards
indebtedness. As a result, consumers who do incur debt are generally more likely to want to repay
it when able to do so.


-----

    - Specific fee and CMS remuneration structure. Different to other markets, German legislation
and established industry practice offer a fee structure that allows CMS companies to charge
delayed payment fees to consumers rather than charging commissions to the debt originators. The
fact that the debt originators themselves are not allowed to charge these fees but DCAs/CMS
companies are is further fueling third party collections.

As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of non-performing loans outstanding was approximately
£25.4 billion in Germany representing an NPL ratio of 1.3%. We believe the German market has a strong pipeline,
with approximately £7.4 billion completed in 2018, £9.6 billion completed in 2019, and we expect to continue to
pursue attractive opportunities to acquire loan portfolios. The level of consumer credit in Germany stood at £171.1
billion as at December 2019, with new flows of £7.1 billion during the year.

_Attractions of the Austrian CMS Market_

In terms of the amount of defaulted consumer debt per capita and the percentage of debt collection
currently outsourced to DCAs, we believe that Austria is significantly smaller than Germany and the UK. We
believe there is a significant potential to benefit from higher outsourcing rates in Austria in the future. Also, since
there are indications of a large pent-up NPL sale volume on the balance sheets of Austrian banks compared to
other European banks, as well as a relatively low penetration of debt purchasers in the Austrian market, we believe
there is potential for market participants to deploy their capital on debt purchases in the Austrian market at
attractive returns.

As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of non-performing loans outstanding was approximately £9.7
billion in Austria representing an NPL ratio of 2.3%. The level of consumer credit in Austria stood at £15.6 billion
as at December 2019.

**_Northern Europe_**

The debt collection industry in the Northern European countries matured following the financial crisis in
the 1990s, when debt collection companies grew their businesses and supported clients in their workout of large,
overdue debt portfolios.

We believe that, based on a third-party market study, the stock of NPLs originated by financial
institutions in the Northern European countries amounted to approximately €5 billion at the end of 2016.
Furthermore, according to the third-party market study, stable NPL ratios and continued growth in total loans
outstanding, owing to a growing economy and historically low interest rates, are expected to lead to a gradual
increase in the NPL stock. Additionally, in the Northern European markets, a significant proportion of products
and services are sold with payment in the future (e.g., invoices, short term facilities, etc.)—creating a growing
stock of consumer trade receivables by retail and telecommunications companies, utilities and companies in many
other industries. This large stock also creates a consistent supply of defaulted unsecured trade debt outstanding
that was estimated to be €4 billion at the end of 2016.

Attractive trends in the Northern European CMS Market include the following:

    - **Enhanced rate of outsourcing and increasing importance of Debt Purchasing. This trend is**
expected to be underpinned by two primary factors:

      - Regulatory factors for financial institutions (e.g., the implementation of IFRS 9) are expected
to increase the levels of outsourcing and sale of debt portfolios. Particularly, the desire to
reduce the proportion of NPLs on their balance sheet and improve their capital ratios can be
expected to lead to an increasing shift toward the sale of debt portfolios. We also expect an
increased willingness amongst banks to re-evaluate their value chain and focus on their core
business as they attempt to manage costs.

      - The emergence of niche consumer banks in the data rich Northern European markets, we
believe, will also lead to a greater amount of outsourcing as such firms, which generally lack
in-house collection capabilities, seek to partner with CMS companies that have proven
collection capabilities.

    - **Increasing sophistication of clients leading to greater demand for CMS companies that offer**
**solutions across the value chain. As clients become increasingly sophisticated, we expect there to**


-----

be an enhanced demand for solutions across the CMS value chain, in particular driven by the
following factors:

      - An increasing need for financial institutions to meet the highest ethical and compliance
standards across all of their business processes (and, increasingly, including outsourced
processes) will lead to a growing need for trusted partners who are chosen based on factors
such as compliance, treatment of customers, quality of collections, track record of experience,
and breadth of product offerings, in addition to pricing.

      - An increasing propensity amongst trade clients to have CMS embedded in their processes and
IT landscape, in order to have greater granularity and visibility into 3PC collections and also
gather greater intelligence on consumer behavior.

As of December 31, 2019, the combined total amount of non-performing loans outstanding in Denmark,
Finland, Norway and Sweden was approximately £21.1 billion, representing a blended NPL ratio of 1.2%.

Based on data from the European Banking Authority (“EBA”), European bank NPL stock amounted to
approximately £0.5 trillion as of December 31, 2019, and could increase to as much as £1.2 trillion, based on a
peak European NPL ratio of 6.8% reached in Q4 2013 and outstanding loans and advances of £18.0 trillion as of
December 31, 2019.

**Overview of industry growth drivers**

There are several market and customer trends affecting the current CMS landscape. Cost reduction is an
important focus area for creditors, who are increasingly capital focused and resource constrained. Collections is
not a core activity for creditors. In addition, increased regulatory pressure and a maturing market environment are
expected to have a positive impact on market evolution and we believe that this will result in:

    - **More debt servicing outsourced. Creditors are increasingly focused on cost reduction and**
process efficiencies.

    - **Smaller panels. Panels are used to maintain competitive intensity, but are generally reducing in**
size.

    - **More debt sold to DPs. Creditors are recognizing the value that DPs provide and are as a result**
selling more debt to DPs.

    - **Debt sold earlier. Debt is being sold earlier as vendors recognize better value realization than**
previously.

    - **Growth in forward flow. Vendors and bidders are increasingly recognizing benefits from forward**
flow in facilitating earlier sales, at better prices, with a lower administrative burden.

**Competitive Dynamics**

In recent years, we believe that there has been a trend towards increased concentration of the CMS
industry around a small core group of companies. See “—Barriers to Entry.”

**_The UK Market_**

Industry consolidation has been supported by the tightening supply of credit globally during the financial
crisis, with only experienced and high-quality debt purchasers in the market being able to secure competitive
financing to support an active debt-acquisition program both during the crisis and thereafter. Recently however,
several international players from the Scandinavian and the U.S. markets (e.g., Hoist, Intrum and Encore) have
expanded from their traditional geographical focuses and sought to compete in the UK.

We believe that many of our UK Division’s current competitors have evolved with a specific investment
focus and associated operational infrastructure, which may make them more or less suited to particular sectors of
the market. Some purchasers are more focused on higher-balance debt or paying debt, which often requires less
tracing capability and cost to collect efficiencies. The importance of historical benchmark data to guide prices on
new debt portfolios means that market participants may also gravitate towards specialty niches in which they have


-----

been more active in the past. As a result, current competitive dynamics primarily reflect the ability of each debt
purchaser to generate appropriate returns on investment, based on its cost structure and operational capabilities.

We believe that large, high-end debt purchasers have outpaced broader market growth in the UK. As the
market consolidates further and panel size reduces, we expect leading players to continue to be materially
advantaged and outperform both the market and their smaller peers in growth and profitability.

**_The German Market_**

With approximately 600 to 900 players, the German CMS market is highly fragmented. Players can be
generally distinguished by service activity and sector focus.

Notwithstanding the fragmentation of the German CMS market, we believe there is a trend towards
consolidation. Only a handful of players (four in 2019, nine in 2016 and five in 2015), including EOS (part of the
Otto Group), our DACH Division, Creditreform and Arvato (part of the Bertelsmann Group) exceed €50 million
in revenue (“Tier I”). “Tier II” players, which comprise companies with revenue in the €10 million to €50 million
range, generally focus on one or two industries or are the German subsidiaries of international CMS corporations.
Small- and medium-sized players typically have a regional focus and serve smaller debt originators, often only in
the third-party collections and services business.

**_The Northern European Market_**

The Northern European CMS market is overall fairly mature compared to the rest of Europe, with the
exception of Denmark which has a lower rate of outsourcing compared to rest of Northern Europe, but is expected
to significantly catch-up as large volumes of portfolios are expected to enter the market in the next several years.
The Northern European CMS market is fragmented, containing a small number of large players, including the
Northern European Division, and a large tail of ~500+ small- to mid-sized CMS competitors. The market has seen
some consolidation during the last 3-5 years, mainly among large companies, but remains fragmented. The
Northern European Division is ranked in the top two in the overall market by ERC.

According to the third-party market study, market revenue of the top 15 players grew at a CAGR of
approximately 10%, from €1.2 billion in 2014 to €1.4 billion in 2016, which was faster than the overall market.
The continued build-up of scalable and efficient platforms by large players coupled with an increased shift towards
higher-margin DP business is expected to contribute to greater growth and profitability.

**_The Austrian Market_**

Outsourcing activities to external debt collectors in Austria are comparatively underdeveloped in relation
to Germany and the UK and provide the chance to deploy capital at relatively attractive returns. We believe that
the debt collection market in Austria today is highly fragmented with participants of scale including EOS and
Arvato and the rest of the market composed of a large number of smaller companies. Similar to Germany, we see
scope for consolidation as the market matures over the coming years.

**_Barriers to Entry_**

The concentration in the European CMS markets over the last several years has resulted in a maturing of
the industry, with the key participants increasing in scale both organically and inorganically and becoming ever
more operationally sophisticated. We believe this has created certain challenges for a new entrant to create a
sustainable business. We believe the following significant barriers to entry exist in the industry:

    - **Regulatory environment and compliance. The industry is subject to increasing levels of legal**
and regulatory oversight. We believe that, in this context, compliance track record and reputation
are key to developing strong relationships with debt originators. Accordingly, we believe that debt
collection in the UK, Germany and Northern Europe requires considerable investment in
processes, know-how and management, making it potentially difficult for a new entrant to be
competitive and increasing barriers to entry. See “Regulation.”


-----

- **Data and pricing models. A new entrant would be unlikely to have an established model with**
which to price debt portfolios, given its lack of historical data sets important for substantiating and
benchmarking collection curves and ultimately for formulating rational prices across varying debt
types and consumer characteristics.

- **Trace and collections platform. The ability to locate account holders, determine their financial**
circumstances and the recoverability of their debt is fundamental to success in collecting in a costeffective manner and generating an appropriate return on investment. The systems of a debt
purchaser, such as the Group, have been developed over an extensive period of time, requiring
substantial investment and expertise.

- **Funding. Across the UK, Germany and Northern Europe, high-yield financing is used in**
combination with revolving credit facilities provided by major banks and securitization programs
as flexible means of funding the purchase of additional debt portfolios. Without the necessary
scale and a successful track record and verifiable projections supported by reliable pricing models,
it could be difficult for a new entrant to obtain cost-effective debt funding to purchase debt
portfolios.

- **Economies of scale. Large debt purchasers can spread their fixed costs across their book of**
existing debt portfolios. This scale provides a cost advantage to an established debt purchaser
when pricing new debt portfolios.

- **Vendor relationships. Key debt originators have established relationships with the leading CMS**
companies in the UK, Germany and Northern Europe. Increasingly, such vendors are seeking to
maintain relationships with a smaller number of service providers. Based on the panel relationships
we have, we believe that vendors have reduced the size of their panels. This means that it is
increasingly important for us to be present on panels. We believe we are amongst the large debt
purchasers present on most major panels in our markets. Whether a debt purchaser has a reputation
for being able to transact purchases on a sustainable basis and a track record of regulatory
compliance is a key consideration for certain vendors and may represent a considerable challenge
for new entrants.

- **Management expertise. The CMS market is relatively concentrated among top players. Proven**
management with deep industry knowledge may be difficult to find and hire.

**OUR GROUP’S BUSINESS**

**Overview**

The Group is one of the largest Credit Management Services (“CMS”) providers in Europe, by revenue
and ERC in the debt purchasing business and by third-party debt under management in the third-party collection
services business. We believe that the business benefits from scale and diversification in terms of broad geographic
reach and balanced revenue mix, together with a complementary and client-focused product offering.
Furthermore, our expertise, management and financial resources provide the Group with excellent opportunities
to drive further growth and diversification in a highly developed, data-rich credit market. These growth prospects
are supported by our clear core competencies: (i) longstanding and multifaceted client relationships built on
differentiated strategies for originating new business; (ii) a broad business model that is diversified across product
offerings, markets and sectors; (iii) a strong track record of return on capital and reliable portfolio pricing; (iv)
strong cash-generation capability featuring high predictability and visibility into future cash flows; and (v) a robust
and improving governance framework with a focus on reputation and compliance that we believe is embedded in
our operational activity.

We provide a range of credit management services across the UK, DACH (collectively, Germany,
Austria and Switzerland) and Northern Europe (collectively, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) to a broad
client base that includes some of the largest credit providers in Europe. The principal activity of the Group is: the
acquisition and collection of non-performing, generally unsecured, consumer debt portfolios (“DP”); and the
provision of third party contingent collection (“3PC”) services. 3PC services include debt servicing offerings such
as early stage collections, business process outsourcing, contingent collections, trace services and litigation
activities. We operate 3PC services primarily in Germany, Austria and Northern Europe. The Group is very well
regarded within the industry, a reputation that is further supported by the Group’s key strategic themes of strong
customer focus and risk management. Best practices relating to our sophisticated pricing, decision science and
cost-optimization experience are continuously shared across our business and make the Group a trusted partner to
credit originators and consumers alike.

Our Group generated total income of £746.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £657.1
million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated
operating profit of £150.5 million, Group cash income of £949.6 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of
£496.0 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated operating profit of £112.0 million,
Group cash income of £930.3 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of £512.7 million (£280.9 million in
our UK Division, £101.4 million in our DACH Division and £133.2 million in our Northern European Division,
net of £2.7 million of Group costs). As of June 30, 2020, our Gross Money Multiple was 2.6x in the UK Division,
3.2x in the DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division and we had £13.2 billion (as of December
31, 2019: £12.4 billion) of third-party debt under management.

We believe that we are a more diversified business than ever before, with a scaled pan-European presence
and a range of services on offer that compares favorably to peers. Our ability to provide a full range of services
across the CMS value chain helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectable data,
which in turn supports the development of tailored collection strategies and analytical capabilities to more
accurately price portfolios. Operating with a balanced business model across Europe also enables us to allocate
resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the opportunities that are most attractive. Furthermore, the
acquisition of the Northern European Division in 2018 has enabled the Group to provide clients with an enhanced
range of value-added services before loans and receivables are overdue. These include invoicing, in which the
client can outsource its CMS to the Northern European Division, and ability to offer consumers payment through
invoice or part payment solutions and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management
capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information.
These solutions have enabled us to access a wider breadth of credit active customers earlier in the value chain,
before the delinquency phase.

As the Group continues to develop, we expect to further capitalize on the Group’s strengths by: (i)
delivering a multi-product, multi-service and pan-regional offering while maintaining clear pricing discipline; (ii)
establishing an industry benchmark for operational excellence through investments in its one-stop service
offering; (iii) maintaining a reputation for pioneering insights by continuously improving its IT, data and
collection platforms through innovations and investment; (iv) continuing to take a best practices approach to its
client relationships and (v) continuing to invest in its employees and corporate culture.

**Our History**

Since the completion of the Lowell Acquisition in October 2015, our Group, which is controlled by
Permira, historically operated through two entities: (i) Metis Bidco Limited and its consolidated direct and indirect
subsidiaries, which operated in the UK and (ii) Lowell Holdco GmbH and its consolidated direct and indirect
subsidiaries, which operated primarily in Germany. As of April 2017, we rebranded the Group as “Lowell” and,
following the 2018 Acquisitions, primarily operate at a Group level, with three divisions: our “UK Division,” our
“DACH Division” and our “Northern European Division.”

As of June 30, 2020, the Group had 3,966 FTEs, with 1,669 in the UK Division, 1,427 in the DACH
Division and 870 in the Northern European Division.

Our UK Division was established in 2004 and is a leading provider of CMS in the UK, the sole
jurisdiction in which it operates. While our UK Division focuses mainly on debt purchase, it performs limited
third-party collection services in several sectors and offers certain other CMS activities. Metis Bidco Limited and
its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries are now contained within our UK Division following our
rebranding in April 2017.

Our DACH Division was founded in 1992 and is a leading provider of CMS in Germany. Our DACH
Division primarily operates in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Our DACH Division is active across the full
value chain of CMS. Lowell Holdco GmbH and its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries are now contained
within the DACH Division following our rebranding in April 2017.

The Northern European Division is an established player across the Northern European markets with a
long track record in each country: Finland (1966), Sweden (1981), Norway (1982) and Denmark (1994). The
Northern European Division is active across the full value chain of CMS with strong capabilities across all client
sectors. The Northern European Division was formed by the combination of Lindorff’s legacy businesses in
Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden, as well as Intrum’s legacy business in Norway.

**Our Key Strengths**

**_Leading position across key European consumer credit markets_**

The Group is the second largest pan-European credit management company by revenue, Group Adjusted
Cash EBITDA and ERC, for the twelve months ended and as of June 30, 2020. Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA
for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was £496.0 million and £512.7
million, respectively. We believe the scale of the Group provides several strategic benefits, including bolstering
our ability to competitively price portfolios in our debt purchasing activities and develop optimal collection
strategies, which we believe will have a positive impact on our revenue and efficiency. Additionally, we believe
that the large scale of our business allows us to absorb fixed costs better than our smaller peers, including those
related to regulatory and legal, compliance and IT, which should further benefit our margins. Our Group Adjusted
Cash EBITDA margin, defined as Group cash income divided by Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA, was 55.1% for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, an improvement from the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.

We believe the Group’s expanded geographic footprint across our eight core markets, with top-three
positions in seven of those markets, combined with top-tier local market positions is a competitive advantage
which will further enhance our ability to follow our clients across markets and deepen client relationships.

The UK Division, DACH Division and the Northern European Division, our current market-leading and
complementary operational divisions, operate primarily in the largest consumer credit markets in Europe, the UK,
Germany and Northern Europe. As of December 2019, the UK had approximately £224 billion (according to the
Bank of England), Germany had approximately £171 billion and Northern Europe had approximately £158 billion
(according to European Central Bank, Swedish Central Bank, Danish Central Bank and Norges Bank) of consumer
credit outstanding. In the year ended December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we invested
£397.3 million and £351.1 million, respectively, to acquire debt portfolios. As of June 30, 2020, we had £13.2
billion of third-party debt under management (a 1.6% increase compared to June 30, 2019), with LTM placements
of over £2.2 billion.

In addition, we believe that by focusing on a broad range of sectors, we are able to address a greater
portion of all consumer credit volumes generated annually in the UK, DACH and Northern Europe, than we would
otherwise be able to address with a less comprehensive approach. We are a market leader and a pioneer in servicing
debt originators across multiple sectors. We also have a strong track record of successfully entering new market


-----

sectors and gaining high market shares in those sectors, such as the telecommunications, retail and public sectors
in the UK, the insurance and fitness sectors in Germany and the financial services sector in Northern Europe.

In the UK, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we believe we had a market-leading share of lowbalance debt portfolio purchases in the telecommunications sector and were among the market leaders in the retail
sector of the UK debt purchase market. In Germany, we believe we are in the top four CMS by revenue. Across
Northern Europe, the Northern European Division purchases debt portfolios across a wide array of industry
verticals and holds the number two market position, as defined by debt collection revenue, in Sweden and Finland.
It is also ranked amongst the top three in Denmark and amongst the top five in Norway.

We believe our scale provides key benefits critical to our success. For example, we are able to develop
and maintain a superior operating platform, with highly skilled talent, customized IT systems and sophisticated
analytical and data capabilities that drive pricing and debt-collection efficiencies. We believe our scale also
enables us to absorb costs associated with legal obligations and regulatory oversight and allows us to provide our
clients with a comprehensive service offering capable of addressing their needs throughout the debt recovery
cycle. Due to our ability to provide a one-stop service offering, we believe we are able to better maintain and
develop relationships with large debt originators than our smaller peers in the UK, DACH and Northern European
markets, and as a result, are better positioned than our smaller peers for rapid growth in these respective markets.
Furthermore, we believe that the acquisition of the Northern European Division has helped our competitive
advantages and fortified our position as a preeminent player in the European CMS sector.

The Company has a proven track record of maintaining long-term relationships with clients which
include some of the largest credit originators in Europe. We have also historically achieved high levels of repeat
purchases from existing customers, which we believe showcases the strong credentials and reputation of our
business. Our CMS service line is a market leading platform in DACH and Northern Europe, with a proven track
record and longstanding client relationships. Our CMS service line maintains over 300 relationships with average
relationship length of approximately eight years.

**_Attractive Market Dynamics Supporting Growth and Profitability_**

We believe that the characteristics of the core markets in which we operate are conducive to sustainable
growth and profitability for the Group. The UK, Germany and Northern Europe have historically benefited from
stable macroeconomic conditions, including high levels of per capita GDP, low inflation, low interest rates and
low unemployment levels. Despite uncertainty around post-Brexit UK and the COVID-19 outbreak and their
respective economic and social ramifications, we believe that our core markets will continue to benefit from
supportive structural factors and an improving macroeconomic environment post-COVID-19. In addition, we
believe that the legal and regulatory environment in each jurisdiction is strong and stable, which, in our view,
fosters market stability. Similarly, we believe that the UK will continue to have a stable legal and regulatory
environment as it applies to our business. We also believe that the demanding nature of regulatory compliance in
UK, Germany and Northern Europe can be burdensome to small businesses and may therefore increase
consolidation opportunities for large players in the CMS.

Moreover, the markets in which we operate comprise a diverse range of sectors in which consumer debt
is originated (e.g., the financial services, insurance, retail, telecommunications, public and utilities sectors, among
others). We believe we are able to develop business in this broad range of sectors, in part, because CMS companies
such as ours can provide certain benefits to debt originators across sectors, including consumer insights and cost
reductions due to reduced administrative and labor costs, improved collection rates and a more professional
approach to debt collection. Further, debt originators’ outsourcing of the debt collection process yields the
additional benefit for the debt originator of reducing management time devoted to what is typically a non-core
activity, while also providing additional consistency in debt handling with a more robustly documented audit trail.

With respect to size and growth of consumer credit markets in our geographies, we believe that the
market in the UK has several distinctive features that make it attractive to CMS companies like us. We believe
that the UK is the largest consumer credit market in Europe, with an estimated £224 billion of outstanding debt
as of December 2019, according to the Bank of England. In addition, we believe that the UK has one of the largest
NPL markets in Europe by face value of defaulted debt sold annually. We believe that the UK consumer NPL
market is consolidating around a small number of sophisticated and large-scale players, such as our UK business,
which we believe is competitively advantaged to grow more quickly, and at higher levels of profitability, than its
smaller peers. We believe such players have a number of structural advantages, including, for example, an ability
to exploit more extensive consumer databases, a heightened capacity to absorb the burdens of an increasingly
demanding compliance environment and an ability to more readily develop a comprehensive service offering for


-----

their clients. Moreover, management has observed a growing propensity on the part of UK debt originators to sell
debt portfolios earlier in the recovery process, and we believe that their demand for other CMS services is likely
to increase, not just in response to COVID-19-related stress but throughout the credit cycle.

Similarly, the consumer credit market in Germany is also distinguished by several features that, in our
view, make it attractive to CMS companies. We believe that Germany is the second largest consumer credit market
in Europe, with an estimated £171 billion of outstanding debt as of December 2019, according to the European
Central Bank. In addition, Germany boasts a large stock of overall defaulted debt and is also one of the largest
consumer NPL markets in Europe by flow of newly created unsecured consumer defaulted debt. A diverse range
of German businesses, from sectors such as financial services, fitness, retail and telecommunications, originate
consumer credit from a diverse consumer base. These businesses use a varied set of collection methods to support
the debt recovery process and typically outsource the majority of their receivables collections. Moreover,
management has observed demand among German debt originators for BPO services and a willingness on the
part of German debt originators to outsource collection in the early stages of the recovery process (for example,
by as early as 45 days after the original payment due date). Since the German CMS market is highly fragmented,
with approximately 600 to 900 players, we believe that large players, such as the Group, have a competitive
advantage due to the scale and the breadth of their client relationships, which helps them originate new debt
purchases and 3PC agreements. In addition, we believe that Germany has both a strong repayment culture and
creditor-friendly laws and regulations, and that together, these features create a favorable environment for debt
collection. Creditors in Germany benefit from a long enforcement period against consumers, since the statutory
limitation period in Germany for applying for and obtaining an enforcement title against consumers is generally
three years and, once obtained, the enforcement title is valid for 30 years. Further, under German law, creditors
are generally entitled to charge additional amounts to the consumer as damage caused by delayed payment,
including default interest, the costs of third-party collection services and legal costs. Each of these factors has, in
our view, helped to drive up the profitability of debt collection in Germany.

The consumer credit market in Northern Europe is also a large and mature market with a stable regulatory
regime. The credit management industry in Northern European countries has existed for more than 100 years, and
matured significantly following the financial crisis in the 1990s, when debt collection companies, including the
Northern European Division, grew their businesses and supported clients in their deleveraging of large, overdue
debt portfolios. In 3PC services, clients have historically preferred well-known and established players. This has
benefited the Northern European Division with its leading pan-Northern European platform. According to a
market study by a leading consultancy firm in September 2017, the proportion of debt portfolio sales compared
to 3PC serviced portfolios is expected to increase from their current level of approximately 40% of the overall
NPL market, as clients, particularly financial institutions, show an increasing willingness to optimize their balance
sheet. The Northern European Division is, thus, also well placed to take advantage of this trend owing to
significant operational synergies among its business segments as its debt collection segment serves as an
origination source for debt purchasing.

Based on data from the European Banking Authority (“EBA”), European bank NPL stock amounted to
approximately £0.5 trillion as of December 31, 2019, representing more than 1.2 times 2007 levels. We believe
that European bank NPL stock could increase to as much as £1.2 trillion, based on a peak European NPL ratio of
6.8% reached in Q4 2013 and outstanding loans and advances of £18.0 trillion as of December 31, 2019. We
expect continued regular and proactive sales by banks as they manage a broad range of new rules and regulations,
such as Basel IV, IFRS 9 and ECB calendar provisioning. As a result, we anticipate an increase in debt sales as a
proportion of NPL stock. Moreover, we believe that non-traditional, digital lenders that have experienced rapid
loan book growth in recent years do not have in-house collection expertise and are likely to engage CMS players
to service their portfolios.

**_A Balanced Business Model with Significant Diversification Benefits_**

The Group operates a balanced and diversified business model. Our debt purchase business and 3PC
services business generated 82% and 18% of Group cash income, respectively, for each of the year ended
December 31, 2019 and 83% and 17%, respectively, the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. During the twelve
months ended June 30, 2020, our Group earned revenue from over 4,000 portfolios for our debt purchasing
business and from over 300 different clients for our third-party collection services. In addition, we believe we
have the most diversified industry mix among our peers. Our client base encompasses clients in the financial
services, insurance, retail, telecommunications, fitness, public and utilities sectors, among others. As of June 30,
2020, our 120M ERC split by industry was financial services (58%), retail (22%), telecommunications (15%),
and other (5%). For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Group’s portfolio purchases split by industry was
financial services (61%), retail (17%), telecommunications (13%) and other (10%). The Group is able to provide

these clients with a one-stop service offering that includes third-party collection services, risk management and
value-added services. We believe this one-stop service offering helps us both to build strategic partnerships and
to embed ourselves further in our clients’ credit-management processes. For example, management has observed
that our provision of third-party debt collection services can lead to debt purchases and help improve our debt
portfolio modelling.

In addition to diversification, we believe our pan-European presence allows us to realize a number of
key benefits that we believe provides us with key competitive advantages. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2020, the UK Division, DACH Division and Northern European Division contributed 47.7%, 27.4% and 24.9%,
respectively, to Group cash income. We believe the combination of allocating capital at a group level into markets
where we believe our risk/reward return is the most attractive and the expertise of the individual businesses allows
us to allocate capital and originate business across markets, sectors and clients to wherever we see the greatest
opportunities. We believe that this increased flexibility enhances our adaptability and resilience in changing
market trends and economic cycles. Moreover, since we have a higher volume of accounts, spread across a more
diverse array of sectors and debt originators, we believe we are advantaged in our pricing accuracy and our ability
to enhance the efficiency of our collection processes.

Our broad-based business model has been enhanced by the acquisition of the Northern European
Division, which is active across the entire CMS value chain in Northern Europe. In addition to 3PC services and
debt purchasing, the Northern European Division provides a wide range of value-added services before debt and
receivables are overdue, including consumer and credit information and analysis, selection and scoring of potential
consumers, invoicing and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management
capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information.

The Northern European Division has reinforced our flexibility and balanced product offering, which we
believe positions us well to maximize revenue by offering solutions to clients along the entire CMS value chain,
enabling us to operate as a “one-stop shop” for our clients. While our predominant activities continue to remain
debt collection and debt purchasing, the value-added services segment has become an important source of
origination for the debt purchasing and debt collection businesses and for data collection.

**_A Consumer-Centric Approach at the Core of our Business_**

Our collection rate is dependent on our ability to both understand consumers and to treat them fairly and
with respect. We believe that by treating our consumers in this manner, and by ensuring regulatory compliance
and maintaining a strong risk management discipline within our Group, we are able to maintain and foster a
positive reputation. We believe that having a positive reputation is a key factor to our success as a debt servicing
company.

Our UK Division has received numerous accolades for its strong track record with respect to the quality
of its customer service. Our UK Division has received a number of awards from Investors in Customers (“IIC”),
a UK customer-experience consultancy, including a “Gold Award” in 2017 (previous “star” ratings have been
replaced with bronze, silver and gold awards and we were the first company to receive the Gold Award), a “Gold
for Investors in Customers” in 2018, “Debt Purchase Provider of the Year” in 2019 and “Best Use of Technology”
for our roll out of Robotic Process Automation in 2019. Our UK Division also benefits from a Trustpilot (a
consumer review website) rating of 4.4/5 stars. Our DACH Division has also been recognized for its consumer
service. According to a 2018 report, we held the highest S&P Servicer Rating level for German CMS providers.
Our Northern European Division has also been recognized for its commitment to consumer service, and in 2019,
Lowell Norway won “The CX Mover: Best implementation – Time to achieve value” at the world’s largest
conference for contact centers and customer experiences in Denver, Colorado, USA.

These achievements are a product of our focus on risk management. Our risk management framework is
grounded in our management structure, our processes and a “three lines of defense” risk-management (see “Our
_Group’s Business—Compliance and Risk Management” for a description of the “three lines of defense” model)_
that we believe mirrors the highest risk-management standards in the CMS industry.

Compliance is at the heart of our Group’s operations. We believe that we have a strong track record with
respect to consumer complaints in all the geographies we operate in. For example, for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2020, the FOS-filed complaint ratio in our UK Division was 11.9 cases filed per one million active
financial services accounts. In our DACH Division, we received, on average, 0.01% consumer complaints as a
percentage of active accounts for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. In our Northern European Division, we
received, on average, 0.003% consumer complaints as a percentage of active accounts for the twelve months


-----

ended June 30, 2020. A focus on risk management and compliance are woven into our Group’s structure from the
local level to the internal and independent external risk control and auditing functions carried out at the executive
and board levels.

We believe the decision science that underlies our Group’s collection techniques contributes to our ability
to manage compliance and reputational risk. We further believe that our focus on and extensive experience in
compliance and risk management resonate well with debt originators and provide us with a competitive advantage
in the UK, DACH and Northern European regulatory environments, which, though different in their particular
legal frameworks and regulations, are similarly designed, robust and stable. It is our view that the well-developed
nature of such environments provides us with a competitive advantage and favors strong market participants, such
as our Group, which has the scale and experience necessary to meet demanding compliance requirements.

Our Group has an overarching commitment to be a fair and principled business that puts people at the
heart of the culture, particularly our consumers. This shared values-based approach is central to our integration
and provide consistency to our vision of being the best in our field.

**_Competitive Advantage Embedded in Sophisticated Data Analytics_**

The Group has invested, and continues to invest, in what we believe to be industry-leading IT and data
platforms in our markets. Through our consumer data, which we believe to also be industry-leading, we have
developed proprietary behavioral and asset valuation models, custom software applications and a variety of other
business tools. The Group’s systems are technologically sophisticated, highly automated and driven by data
derived from databases of owned and serviced debt portfolios in the markets in which we operate, and we believe
that our Group has the largest databases in the UK and DACH and one of the largest datasets in Northern Europe.
State of the art data science techniques serve as an integral part in the process of pricing portfolios ahead of
acquisitions and allow the business to establish more efficient debt, consumer and customer engagement
strategies. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s systems held data derived from some 4,281 owned debt portfolios,
of which there were 22.2 million active accounts. We believe that our data systems benefit from a virtuous circle
that further strengthens our informational advantage relative to that of our competitors. In our experience, the
more debt portfolios we service or purchase, the more data and collection experience we derive and the more
accurate our tracing and pricing systems become. We also believe that our systems’ increasing sophistication has
the additional benefit of making them increasingly difficult to replicate.

Thus, given the breadth of our experience throughout the credit management value chain, we have access
to comprehensive databases of purchased and serviced debt. Our IT and data platforms are subject to an ongoing
process of improvement and innovation, which we support with ongoing investment. We believe that our
sophisticated and scalable IT and data platforms, in which we have made robust investments, provide significant
competitive advantages. Combined with our decision science capabilities, we are able to take a centralized
approach to forecasting and pricing that is supported by specialist local input, ensuring strong cross-organizational
evaluation of portfolio pricing. In our experience, our automated pricing models and tracing systems have helped
to increase the accuracy with which we price both owned debt portfolios and third-party collection service
contracts, thereby increasing our chance to win a bid at the right price while reducing our downside risk on the
owned debt portfolio or signed contract.

The Group’s data capabilities combined with lean operational processes also facilitate more efficient and
effective debt collection strategies through robotics, data science and cross-learning. In addition, the risk
management approach of the Group helps to ensure that the sophisticated pricing information is used in an
investment decision-making context that focuses on compliance and maintaining strong internal controls. We
believe that our sophisticated collection strategies and approach to a digital enabled business, in turn, lead to
increased collection efficiency and reduced collection costs. Further, we believe our sophisticated IT and data
platforms allows us to compete effectively in sectors in which our peers struggle to generate sufficient returns, in
particular in low-balance sectors such as retail, telecommunications and utilities.

**_Strong Track Record of Return on Capital and Portfolio Pricing Through the Cycle_**

We believe that we have a track record of strong and stable return on capital supported by continuous
improvement in decision science and the use of feedback from our collection operations. The Group’s aggregate
Gross Money Multiple on portfolios purchased as of June 30, 2020 was 2.6x in our UK Division, 3.2x in our
DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division. Moreover, since Group management is involved in
investment decisions at each division, we believe that we are able to deploy our capital across the UK, DACH and
Northern European regions to wherever returns are most promising, which we believe contributes to our ability


-----

to maintain high returns on capital. We believe that continuous improvement in decision science and leveraging
feedback from collection operations have helped strengthen our underwriting, resulting in a narrower disparity
between forecasted and actual returns. Our historical actual collections compared to forecast collections
demonstrate our accurate and disciplined yet prudent forecasting. We have steadily met or exceeded our forecasted
collections, even during more challenging economic environments. For example, following the 2008 to 2009
financial crisis, our UK predecessor company’s actual collections exceeded forecasts, with actual collections on
the December 31, 2008 static pool reaching 104% of forecasted collections by June 2020. Our Group’s actual
Gross Debt Purchase Collections on portfolios owned by the Group as of December 31 of the prior year (the
“static pool”) were 103% of our forecasted collections for the year ended December 31, 2018, 104% of our
forecasted collections for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 94% of our forecasted collections for the six
months ended June 30, 2020, and we have met or outperformed our forecasted collections on the static pool each
year between 2007 and 2019.

We believe that our disciplined approach to portfolio pricing has helped us avoid overbidding on debt
portfolios. Our portfolio pricing process begins with a rigorous and extensive due diligence and valuation exercise,
which may involve, among other things, building a synthetic debt portfolio with actual performance data and
similar consumer characteristics and performing on-site file testing to assess the underlying quality of the debt
portfolio before submitting our final bid. Our due diligence and valuation methods benefit from the market-leading
scale of our data, our sophisticated and automated data systems and our experienced and skilled portfolio pricing
specialists. Our ability to leverage our own data and our specific expertise and databases from comparable
portfolios across many sectors minimizes risk and helps to ensure accurate pricing bolstered by strong in-house
analytical capabilities. Upon the successful completion of due diligence, a debt portfolio is subject to a clear and
systematic internal review and approval process culminating in a decision to either approve or reject the proposed
portfolio investment. Our disciplined capital deployment and selectivity with respect to portfolio purchases has
helped us achieve an IRR with respect to our portfolio purchases of 19% for the twelve months ended June 30,
2020 compared to 16% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.

**_High Visibility into Future Cash Flow Generation_**

Our debt portfolio purchase business provides excellent visibility into future earnings, as well as
substantial cash-flow generation backed by a significant asset base. Although the Group’s ERC metrics extend
for up to 180 months, depending on the division, a majority of collections occur within the first 48 months. As of
June 30, 2020, we expected approximately 34% of our 120M ERC to be collected within the next 24 months and
approximately 58% to be collected within the 48-month period. As of June 30, 2020, the Group had 4,281 owned
debt portfolios and 120M ERC was £3,466.1 million, resulting in an aggregate Gross Money Multiple on
portfolios purchased of 2.6x for our UK Division, 3.2x for our DACH Division and 2.5x for the Northern European
Division. We believe we take a cautious approach to repayment by attempting to establish recurring payment
methods with lower rates of default, such as direct debits and continuous payment authorizations on debit and
credit cards.

In addition, we believe that the multi-year nature of our forward flow agreements helps to provide us
with visibility into new business origination and expected returns. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 55%
of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases came from forward flow agreements. Similarly, forward flow
agreements accounted for 55% and 67% of portfolio purchases in the DACH Division and Northern European
Division respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020.

In addition, we made £351.1 million of portfolio purchases for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020
and believe that our significant asset base of owned debt portfolios is capable of continuing to yield predictable
cash flows. We believe that our ERC forecast is reliable and resilient, as a significant portion of the payments on
our portfolios are made through long-term payment plans. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 long term
payment plans as a percentage of collections was 80% in the UK Division, 40% in the DACH Division and 24%
in the Northern European Division.

Our third-party collection services business is also cash generative and typically enables us to scale our
business without requiring significant incremental investments. We believe that the contractual arrangements in
the third-party collection services business, which are both stable and of increasing durations (notably for contracts
with large, well-known clients), provide visibility into future collections, the fees we derive from them as well as
associated cash-flow generation. Our income from 3PC services was £169.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 and £158.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019
income from 3PC services represented 17.8% of Group cash income and for the twelve months ended June 30,
2020 income from 3PC services represented 17.1% of Group cash income.


-----

Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA was £496.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £512.7
million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, and 120M ERC was £3,466.1 million as of June 30, 2020.
Our Group cash income, gross profit, and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA each increased between the twelve
months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020. For more information regarding Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA, 120M
ERC and other non-IFRS financial measures and non-financial operating data, see “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information.”_

**_Management Team Supported by Skilled and High-Quality Business Professionals_**

We are managed by a strong executive team, which comprises individuals with many years of relevant
experience and provides leadership across all functional areas of our business. In particular, we believe that our
business has one of the most experienced senior management teams among European CMS companies. For
example, our current CEO previously served as CFO from 2013 until his appointment to CEO in June 2019 and
has over 17 years’ experience in the financial services industry, and our CFO who joined in 2020 has 29 years of
senior executive experience including 13 years in FTSE 100 organizations. The Group has a wide bench of strong
management talent spread across our regions.

In addition, strong teams of qualified professionals, who are drawn from the wider financial services
industry and other large corporate entities involved in consumer outreach, support our senior management team
by performing central business functions and assisting in the execution of our strategy. These skilled managers
are supported by a workforce of approximately 3,966 FTEs as of June 30, 2020. We continuously invest in our
employees with sustained efforts to create an inclusive and staff-friendly work environment and to provide
meaningful career-development opportunities.

Our combined corporate governance structure is intended to provide strong oversight and to support
decision-making while retaining the entrepreneurial spirit and market specific knowledge required to extend our
strong track record of growth and profitability. Our executive team has established compliance frameworks,
operational procedures and governance structures, supported by a number of proprietary systems, to enable us to
conduct business in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and guidance.

**Our Strategy**

**_Consumer Focus and Relationships that Provide Long-Term Value Creation_**

We aim to continue our discipline of operating ethically, transparently and in compliance with all
applicable rules, regulations and guidance. We intend to focus on providing a fair, understanding and consumer
centric approach to our debt collection services. To that end, we intend to work with each consumer to develop a
payment plan that is realistic, sustainable through economic cycles and tailor-made to the consumer’s
circumstances, allowing the consumer to restore his or her financial standing and continue to access mainstream
credit products. To maintain and enhance this individualized approach to our consumers, we intend to continue to
leverage our decision science capabilities in order to help ensure that the consumer profiles we build are as
accurate and up-to-date as possible. We aim to communicate closely, clearly and transparently with the consumer
and strive to understand their situation and circumstances. We believe that clear communication will enable us to
have visibility with regard to the timing and profile of future collections.

As the legal and regulatory environments in which we operate continue to evolve, we intend to adapt our
culture, practices and policies appropriately, while always seeking to be the model that others look to for
compliance standards and best practices. Compliance is an increasingly important differentiating factor in our
industry and in the markets in which we operate. We believe that our focus on compliance reassures our clients
that their customers and reputations are in safe hands, and thus will give us a key competitive advantage going
forward.

**_Establish an Industry Benchmark for Operational Excellence Through a Diversified One-Stop Offering_**

We believe that debt originators are increasingly seeking a holistic, cost-efficient approach to CMS that
fully complies with applicable regulations. To address this growing need, we aim to continue to develop our onestop service offering, a differentiated services offering that addresses each step of the debt recovery cycle and
thereby helps us to further embed our operations within those of our clients. We also intend to further diversify
our one-stop service offering by capitalizing on the Northern European Division’s value-added services offering.
Moreover, we have a strong track record of opening new sectors to the CMS market, such as entering into the
telecommunications and utilities market in the UK, and we seek to continue to build relationships with entities


-----

that have not previously sold debt portfolios or purchased CMS services. Our geographic diversity has positioned
us to fully leverage our geographic footprint by launching products which have been successful in one market into
our other markets. Our longstanding client relationships and high volumes of data in our UK, DACH and Northern
European markets, along with our meaningful presence throughout our other markets, contribute to our ability to
anticipate our clients’ changing needs while identifying new market opportunities.

The Group’s strategy will be focused on increasing its current share of the CMS markets in the UK,
DACH and the Northern European regions by continuing to work closely with the main debt originators in each
of our key sectors. We have adopted a proactive approach to managing our relationships with debt originators,
with an emphasis on transparency and building longstanding professional relationships based on a granular
understanding of a debt originator’s business and CMS requirements. This local, specialized approach to our client
relationships allows us to provide specialized offerings that have been tailored to reflect the consumer’s individual
needs.

**_Maintain Our Reputation for Pioneering Insights by Continuously Improving our IT, Data Analytics, Data_**
**_Science and Collection Platforms through Innovations and Investment_**

We are continuously looking to improve our IT, data analytics, data science and collection platforms and
processes and harmonize our core applications in order to strengthen our services offering and operate more
efficiently. We aim to extend our strong track record of implementing incremental technological and collection
process improvements, which have contributed to enhanced performance and increased efficiency throughout our
business. For example, in the UK we are actively deploying technology through which we are able to more closely
tailor our contact to the consumer’s unique circumstances. In addition, on a Group-wide basis we are
implementing a multi-channel digital strategy to better connect with our consumers. We believe these initiatives
will improve the efficiency of our operations platform through cost reductions, increased collections or a
combination of these two effects. Sophisticated data analytics underpin our disciplined approach to pricing and
investment decisions, which we believe are an integral part of our strategy and which differentiate us from our
competition.

**_Develop Sustainable Competitive Advantage in Chosen Markets to Facilitate Continued Growth_**

Our strategy is to ultimately become the leading multi-product and multi-service provider of CMS
services in our chosen markets. We believe that we have a complementary set of competitive advantages across
the UK, DACH and Northern European regions that are essential to helping us achieve this objective. Our UK
Division is a leader in the UK CMS market and possesses one of the most sophisticated debt purchase platforms
in Europe. Our DACH Division is a leading player in the DACH debt purchase and third-party collection services
markets and provides our clients with a diversified service offering that harnesses our expertise in a range of CMS
services, including BPO and risk-management services. Our Northern European Division also has a leading
position in the Northern European CMS market, including BPO and risk-management services in the Northern
European financial institutions client segment that possesses one of the most sophisticated debt purchasing and
collection platforms in the data-rich Northern European region. By sharing best practices within the Group and
utilizing our complementary competencies in debt purchasing and outsourced credit services, we believe the
strength of each of our divisions enables us to seize new opportunities to help us expand our offering both
geographically and throughout several key market sectors.

Our pricing discipline and systematic, objective pricing processes remain an integral part of our strategy
and lay the foundation for us to build a sustainable competitive advantage. We believe that as a result of our
pricing discipline, among other factors, we have been able to grow our asset base and profits, notwithstanding the
changing economic environment, and have maintained stable, strong and predictable overall returns on capital
across our sectors. We plan to continue to invest in our pricing methodologies and capitalize on the virtuous circle
by which the consumer profiles and collections data we gather each month continuously add to the accuracy and
sophistication of our systems and models. Moreover, since we make investment decisions at the Group level, we
believe we will be able to deploy our capital across the Group to wherever returns are most promising, which we
believe will contribute to our ability to maintain high returns on capital.

**_Continue to Invest in Our Employees and Corporate Culture_**

Our reputation is extremely important to us, both among our clients and among our employees. We search
for people with enthusiasm, passion and commitment and when we find them, we invest in them heavily in order
to deliver on our promises of connection, communication, development, involvement, recognition and reward.
They create the culture that defines our business, protects our reputation and drives our performance, and they


-----

constitute the primary component of our consumers’ experience. We strive to build a unique corporate culture in
which our people are imbued with a sense of engagement and belonging. We believe that our focus on our people
and our efforts to build a unique corporate culture help to drive our collection performance and contribute to our
ability to provide an enhanced consumer experience.

**_Enter into Strategic Partnerships with Reputable Investors and Financial Institutions_**

In our debt purchasing segment, we see a pipeline in terms of the number and the size of investment
opportunities available, which is outpacing our on-balance sheet investment capacity. In such a scenario, coinvestment structures are opportunities for the Group to gain access to larger portfolios and build scale through
our ability to source, price and service unsecured consumer finance portfolios. We believe this will contribute to
an increase of the revenue from third-party servicing and help to better manage the Group’s financial profile by
adjusting exposure and overall allocation. In order to partner with well-established co-investors, the investors
must be confident that we are able to service the portfolio in an efficient and professional manner without any
conflict of interest or principal-agent problems.

We believe the ability to transact with established investors creates a unique advantage for the Group:

    - Expand purchasing capacity – ability to participate in larger deals across our markets with less
capital intensity;

    - Higher returns – opportunity to leverage servicing platforms (acting as servicer of portfolios) and
gain scale; and

    - Lower risk – ability to manage the risk versus return by adjusting own exposure depending on
market WACC and desired overall allocation, regardless of transaction sizes.

In January 2020, we entered into an NPL purchase agreement with German private bank Oldenburgische
Landesbank (OLB). Under the terms of the arrangement, we will procure NPLs in the DACH region for OLB, up
to an amount of €30 million per year. We will carry out debt collections and servicing on all debt portfolios
through a master servicing agreement, which will provide a new stream of future servicing income.

Also in January 2020, we entered into a co-investment partnership with a listed global asset manager
with Assets under Management and Administration (AuMA) of over £300 billion as of June 30, 2020. Under this
partnership, the global asset manager and the Group will acquire 90% and 10% interests, respectively, in nonperforming loan portfolios across the Group’s markets with targeted deployments of €300 million over a three
year period. The Group will carry out debt collections/servicing on all acquired portfolios through a master
servicing agreement providing a new stream of future servicing income.

**_Strong Focus on Leverage and Funding Diversification_**

Prudent capital management is at the center of our financial policy.

We organically reduced the Group’s consolidated total net leverage ratio to 4.7x as of June 30, 2020, a
decrease of 0.4x since June 30, 2019, on the back of better front book returns and overall margin improvement
driven by strong cost control and slower overall spend. The consummation of the Transactions is expected to
further reduce overall leverage of the Group as of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, to a consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.6x. Due to our decision to temporarily pause new
litigation activity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect our Gross Debt Purchase Collections in 2020
to fall short of previous estimates and, notwithstanding COVID-19 related cost reduction measures, we expect
Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA to slightly decline in the year ending December 31, 2020 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2019 and, as a consequence, total net leverage to increase slightly during this period. See
_“—Recent Developments—COVID-19.” However, we expect the reduction in overall leverage to continue as we_
remain committed to our publicly stated leverage guidance of a consolidated total net leverage ratio in the range
of 4.0x to 3.5x by 2021-2022. Our deleveraging targets assume resumption of UK litigation activity from H2 2020
onwards and no further forbearance measures (either voluntary or government-imposed) in any of our regions.
While we believe our stated leverage guidance to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from these estimates
and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information and this
information may not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of the financial year or any future period.
See “Forward-Looking Statements.”


-----

In addition, the Group is actively exploring alternative ways to fund growth. Recent examples include
our focus on growing our relatively less capital intense servicing segment and pursuing co-investment structure
opportunities, including our recent co-investment partnership with a listed global asset manager, which has
targeted deployments of €300 million to purchase non-performing loan portfolios over the next three years, as
well as a partnership with a bank managing over €20 billion in assets to carry out debt collections and servicing
on all owned debt portfolios. See “—Our Strategy—Enter into Strategic Partnerships with Reputable Investors
_and Financial Institutions.”_

As our pipeline of potential investment opportunities continues to outpace our on-balance sheet
investment capacity, co-investment structures present opportunities for the Group to access larger portfolios and
build scale by capitalizing on our ability to source, price and service unsecured consumer finance portfolios. We
expect this to drive increasing income from third-party servicing and to help better manage the Group’s financial
profile by improving the composition of our portfolio exposures and allocations. The ability to transact with
established investors presents a unique opportunity for the Group to (i) expand our purchasing capacity and our
ability to participate in larger deals across geographies with less capital intensity, (ii) generate higher returns and
create further opportunities to leverage our servicing platforms and gain scale and (iii) improve our risk/return
management and profile by adjusting our exposures depending on market WACC and desired allocation mix
regardless of transaction sizes.

**_Participate Opportunistically in Consolidation of our Industry when Accretive Opportunities Exist_**

We have a strong track record of selective and accretive expansion in the UK and Germany, as
demonstrated by our acquisition of IS Inkasso Service in May 2016, the Tesch Group in September 2016 and
Apontas in October 2016 and the Northern European Division from Intrum in April 2018 and Lucas Credit
Services in July 2019. Furthermore, the Group has a proven track record of successfully expanding by acquiring
carve-outs of the internal collections businesses of banks, insurers, telecoms and utility companies. In July 2020,
we announced the acquisition of Solvencia AS, which we believe will establish us as a leading 3PC player in
Norway, strengthen our 3PC business in Sweden and Finland and build up our Northern European Division’s
capability to collect small balance debts in Norway. The acquisition closed on October 1, 2020.

As our business continues to develop, we intend to continue to participate opportunistically in the
consolidation of the European CMS industry in order to build scale, address untapped consumer segments and
create new relationships with debt originators. We intend to strategically pursue further carve-out transactions
with current clients and credit-accretive bolt-on acquisitions. We will continue to apply our strong and disciplined
approach to valuation in connection with these potential acquisitions.

**Operations and Service Offerings**

We believe the Group is one of Europe’s leading providers of CMS specializing in debt recovery. Our
experience, expertise and core strengths in data analytics and operational efficiency underpin our vision to be the
most reputable and trusted partner in the European credit management sector. In the UK, DACH region and
Northern Europe, we provide a full-service offering, covering the debt collection value chain, consisting primarily
of purchases of debt portfolios, as well as third-party collection services and other CMS. We believe this offering
provides our clients with a “one-stop shop” solution that delivers value throughout the credit lifecycle.
Furthermore, we believe that many of our clients have significant incentives to outsource their debt collection or
to sell their portfolios of overdue debt as a result, for example, of their strategy to focus on core business activities
that do not include defaulted debt management.

Our Gross Debt Purchase Collections for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018 were split across several industries. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we
generated 50% of our Gross Debt Purchase Collections from financial services (2019: 49%; 2018: 48%), 18%
from retail (2019: 18%; 2018: 19%), 21% from telecommunications (2019: 21%; 2018: 21%), 2% from fitness
(2019: 2%; 2018: 3%), and 10% from other industries (2019: 9%; 2018: 9%).

Group cash income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was £930.3 million and generated a split
by (i) geography: the UK (47.7%), DACH (27.4%) and Northern Europe (24.9%) and (ii) business segment: debt
purchase (82.9%) and 3PC services (17.1%). Group cash income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was
£949.6 million and generated a split by (i) geography: the UK (48%), DACH (27%) and Northern Europe (25%)
and (ii) business segment: debt purchase (82%) and 3PC services (18%). Group cash income for the year ended
December 31, 2018 was £873.8 million and generated a split by (i) geography: the UK (48%), DACH (25%), and
Northern Europe (26%) and (ii) business segment: debt purchase (80%) and 3PC services (20%).

**Debt Purchase**

We believe that bundling our expertise, knowledge and methods group-wide leads to an increase of
effectiveness in our debt purchase process. As a result, a mutual standardized approach is followed across our
divisions. Each region has its own transaction management process team that implements debt purchase and CMS
portfolios locally but with Group-wide oversight where best practice approaches are shared. The transaction
management teams are responsible for implementing the debt purchase process and managing the required aspects
of the purchase transaction and work with Group teams, decision science, operations, legal, and others areas to
lead cross-functional deal teams and improve information flow while ensuring that all client and regulatory
requirements are met or surpassed. The overarching process comprises four main stages: (1) debt portfolio
origination; (2) debt portfolio purchase; (3) debt portfolio segmentation, analytics and strategy; and (4) the
collection process.

**_Debt Portfolio Origination_**

_Our UK Division’s Debt Portfolio Origination_

Our UK Division has been active in the UK debt purchase market since 2004 and, as of June 30, 2020,
had purchased 2,473 debt portfolios, consisting of approximately 15.8 million active accounts, for cumulative


-----

portfolio purchases of £1,974.0 million and an aggregate face value at time of purchase of £23.5 billion. The
majority of debt portfolios are currently offered to the market through spot sales featuring a competitive tender
process, which typically involves three or four debt purchasers selected by the client. These auctions may be
managed directly by the vendor or may be facilitated by an intermediary, such as a leading advisory firm. Other
spot sales channels include, for example, an increasingly common bilateral process in which a debt portfolio is
offered to a single purchaser on an exclusive basis. Furthermore, we have entered into forward flow agreements
with a number of top debt originators, pursuant to which we have purchased all or substantially all of such debt
originators’ debt sales, subject to pre-agreed criteria. We generally enter into forward flow agreements through a
competitive bidding process and renew such agreements on a bilateral basis. See “—Debt Portfolio Purchase—
_Types of Debt Purchase Agreements—Forward flow agreements.” To facilitate our portfolio purchases, we_
maintain a live sales tracker with data on up to twelve months of forecast debt portfolio sales in the UK market,
including estimates of face value, number of accounts, debt type, pricing and timing of individual acquisition
opportunities. This tracker allows our executive team to actively pursue opportunities and tailor our strategy to
changing conditions. This rolling twelve-month forecast is reviewed by our sales team on a weekly basis and
enables us to monitor the progress of our debt portfolio purchases throughout the relevant financial year.

_Our DACH Division’s Debt Portfolio Origination_

Our DACH Division has been active in the DACH region debt purchase market since 2003 and, as of
June 30, 2020, had purchased 562 debt portfolios, consisting of approximately 4.1 million active accounts, for
cumulative portfolio purchases of €664.3 million (£605.9 million) and an aggregate face value at time of purchase
of €6.4 billion (£5.8 billion). We acquire debt portfolios in the DACH region through spot sales and forward flow
agreements, each of which can be transacted by way of market debt tender or off-market sales. We believe we are
invited to most major market debt tender processes in the German market. In a typical off-market sale, we are one
of a limited number of purchasers in the DACH region engaged in discussions with a debt originator. In these
situations, we have the opportunity to negotiate the content of the portfolio acquired and can work with the debt
originator to agree on terms that maximize target outcomes for both parties. Our specialized sales teams maintain
close relationships with debt originators and leverage those relationships, along with our strong reputation in the
debt collection market of the DACH region, to win new business and thus to originate new portfolios.

_Our Northern European Division’s Debt Portfolio Origination_

Our Northern European Division has been active in the Northern European debt purchase market since
2003 and, as of June 30, 2020, had purchased 1,246 debt portfolios, consisting of approximately 2.3 million active
accounts, for cumulative portfolio purchases of €1,181.1 million (£1,077.1 million) and an aggregate face value
at time of purchase of approximately €6.1 billion (£5.6 billion). The majority of portfolios for sale are currently
offered to the market through competitive tender processes, although the Northern European Division also
engages its clients in discussions to purchase portfolios through bilateral negotiations whenever opportunities
arise. A key driver of our success in debt purchasing has been our ability to leverage relationships with clients for
whom we collect debt through outsourcing contracts. Our local sales teams maintain close relationships with key
debt originators in the countries where we operate. In addition, our senior management maintains close
relationships on a cross-border level with major key debt originators and is actively involved in their largest
transactions with these sellers. Through these relationships, the Northern European Division often receives
requests for proposals in relation to the portfolios for sale.

We believe that we are uniquely situated in the UK, DACH region and Northern European markets in
terms of the proportion of debt portfolios that each acquires pursuant to forward flow agreements.

**_Debt Portfolio Purchase_**

_Our UK Division’s Debt Portfolio Purchasing_

In the UK, a debt portfolio vendor will supply interested parties with a tender document that includes
debt portfolio information at an account level, which in our experience is often stale and incomplete. Our
automated portfolio pricing models and tracing systems, along with our significant track record with debt
originators, provide us with the ability to evaluate a debt portfolio for sale in great detail before we make a decision
to purchase. With what we believe to be the largest consumer database in the UK CMS market and efficient tracing
capabilities, we are able to supplement the information provided by the debt originator to improve our analysis of
the portfolio. The high crossover rate of accounts between sectors further improves our tracing capabilities and
increases the amount of consumer data we have available to inform our pricing decisions in the UK. Given the
size of the reference database on our backbook, we have been able to carry out significant statistical analyses to


-----

determine the key variables that drive collection performance on consumer accounts. See “—Decision Science—
_Our UK Division’s Decision Science.” We develop detailed collection curves and cost curves for a new debt_
portfolio to determine a maximum price to bid, which often includes benchmarking the characteristics of the debt
portfolio’s consumer base against similar debt portfolios we purchased. We also build synthetic debt portfolios
with actual performance data and consumer characteristics similar to those of the portfolio being considered.
These methods allow us to make a detailed pricing recommendation to our UK Division Investment Committee,
which will determine our final bid price. Due to our reputation and experience, we are invited to bid on a large
proportion of debt sold in the UK market.

_Our DACH Division’s Debt Portfolio Purchasing_

Prior to acquiring a debt portfolio, we evaluate the purchase opportunity through a multi-stage process
generally consisting of two rounds of bidding, an indicative bid and a final bid, along with extensive due diligence
throughout the process. As part of our due diligence, we receive both consumer information (e.g., gender, age and
address) and receivables information (e.g., outstanding principal balance, interest and fees due, claim size and
payment history information). If the debt originator accepts our indicative bid, it will then typically provide us
with additional information on the portfolio, allowing us to perform a more complete review to determine the
underlying quality of the portfolio. In this second phase of due diligence, we typically perform a detailed on-site
assessment of the portfolio’s value. In both the indicative and final bid stages, we use historical payment and
reference portfolio analyses to determine a potential price that represents the discounted value of estimated cash
flows net of costs. Our governance process with regard to new investments depends on the total amount to be
invested.

_Our Northern European Division’s Debt Portfolio Purchasing_

The Northern European Division has extensive experience in acquiring portfolios of overdue loans and
other overdue receivables at attractive prices. We generate revenue after purchasing portfolios by applying our
collection process and approach to optimize the cash collected and thereby generating a proven track record of
attractive returns on the investments. We believe that the Northern European Division can generate attractive
yields over the life of the portfolios due to our expertise in pricing unsecured consumer NPLs, knowledge of the
portfolios we purchase and our debt collection abilities.

Among the investment criteria that the Northern European Division considers is the portfolio’s expected
return and whether we match our strict pricing discipline to maintain high portfolio returns and avoid overbidding.
We believe that one of the Northern European Division’s core strengths is that we typically service the portfolios
we purchase in-house. In this way, we control the entire debt collection process and are able to implement optimal
debt collection strategies as well as ensure that customers are treated fairly and with respect. We believe that the
efficient, fair and respectful manner in which the Northern European Division conducts its business upon
purchasing a portfolio is evident through its many long-standing client relationships.

_Types of Debt Purchase Agreements_

In the UK, DACH and Northern Europe we purchase debt portfolios pursuant to two types of
arrangements: spot sales and forward flow agreements.

    - **Spot sales. We purchase debt portfolios through “spot” agreements, the terms of which are**
individually negotiated on a case-by-case basis. A spot agreement generally relates to a single
portfolio. In the UK, spot sales may be conducted through auctions or bilateral sales. In Germany,
spot sales are mostly conducted through auctions. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, spot
agreements accounted for approximately 45% of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases (£210.9
million in total), approximately 45% of our DACH Division’s portfolio purchases (€78.3 million
(£68.5 million) in total) and 34% of our Northern European Division’s portfolio purchases (€82.0
million (£71.7 million) in total). See “Industry and Market Data—Debt Purchasing—Methods of
_Debt Sale—Spot sale.”_

    - **Forward flow agreements. A forward flow agreement is an agreement to buy several portfolios**
over a period of time at a predetermined pricing mechanism, specified credit quality and point in
the debt recovery cycle. We have entered into forward flow agreements with a number of top debt
originators. From our UK Division’s Start Date (June 1, 2004) to June 30, 2020, 43% of its
portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements and agreements that were a
mixture of a forward flow agreement with a spot purchase. From our DACH Division’s Start Date


-----

(September 30, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 48% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to
forward flow agreements. From our Northern European Division’s Start Date (January 1, 2003) to
June 30, 2020, 31% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements. For
the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, forward flow agreements accounted for approximately
55% of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases, approximately 55% of our DACH Division’s
portfolio purchases and approximately 67% of our Northern European Division’s portfolio
purchases, representing approximately £115.8 million, €43.0 million (£37.6 million) and €63.5
million (£47.6 million) in portfolio purchases, respectively.

Forward flow agreements enable us to benefit from tailored, long-term and continuous debt purchase
arrangements. The long-term nature of forward flow agreements, combined with the ongoing debt originator
relationships that result from them, provide us with visibility as to purchase volumes and expected returns. In
addition, we are able to adjust the price of certain new debt portfolios we purchase in the UK over the duration of
a forward flow agreement in accordance with the performance of previously purchased portfolios, the quality of
debt in the new portfolio and our current forecasts, which are derived from models mutually agreed between the
debt originator and us. Moreover, debt in portfolios acquired pursuant to forward flow agreements tends to be
“fresher” than debt in portfolios sold by other means because there is less of a delay between when the debt is
considered defaulted and when we can begin collections. As a general rule, the “fresher” the debt, the higher our
collection expectations, since customers’ willingness to engage with us and repay typically decays over time
following a default. See “Industry and Market Data—Methods of Debt Sale—Forward flow agreement.” In the
twelve months ended June 30, 2020, more than 57% of our portfolio purchases were the result of forward flow
agreements.

**_Debt Portfolio Segmentation and Strategy_**

_Our UK Division’s Debt Portfolio Segmentation and Strategy_

Following the successful acquisition of a debt portfolio in the UK, we commence a series of automated
processes that load the debt portfolio onto our collections platform, obtain consumer data and append such data
to the debt portfolio, and perform an analysis of each individual consumer’s propensity to pay, following which
an initial collections strategy is set. We are able to load the portfolio onto our system and run the related processes
within a reasonable timeframe by analyzing and tracing millions of accounts. This avoids the need to reach out
indiscriminately to all accounts, which would increase costs. We tailor our approach and focus on the consumer
accounts that we believe have the greatest propensity to pay. For further information, see “—Decision Science—
_Our UK Division’s Decision Science.”_

_Our DACH Division’s Debt Portfolio Segmentation and Strategy_

Upon receipt of a consumer’s account file in our DACH Division, we “onboard,” or integrate, it into our
DACH Division’s databases. Throughout the collection process, we retrieve additional consumer data via our
external data providers, leveraging best-of-breed data providers in the areas of credit information, address data
and telephone numbers. Our highly automated operating platform allows us to onboard a significant amount of
new accounts in our DACH Division, and we currently onboard more than one million new accounts each year.
As of June 30, 2020, our DACH Division had serviced in total 27.6 million accounts and had collected information
on 28.6 million consumers, including consumers from both 3PC serviced accounts and accounts in our owned
debt portfolios. This information allows us to more accurately determine collection strategies. For further
information, see “—Decision Science—Our DACH Division’s Decision Science.”

_Our Northern European Division’s Debt Portfolio Segmentation and Strategy_

After acquiring a portfolio, our Northern European Division typically manages the portfolio in-house.
Our Northern European Division has a deep understanding of the debt collection process, which enables us to
tailor approaches for each customer and to determine whether we can offer additional value to customers through
a variety of collection methods. By servicing owned debt portfolios in-house, we are also able to provide stability
and scale to the debt collection segment of our business, which allows us to improve and enhance our debt
collection methods. For further information, see “—Decision Science—Our Northern European Division’s
_Decision Science.”_

**Collection Process**

**_Our UK Division’s Collection Process_**

Our UK Division’s approach to collections is focused on delivering the optimum return on capital
employed by minimizing cost versus collection potential. Contacting consumers with the highest propensity to
pay is key to minimizing servicing costs and optimizing returns. Between June 1, 2004 and June 30, 2020, we
have needed to collect from only 29% of our UK consumer accounts in order to achieve returns. To achieve this
result, we use a sophisticated statistical analysis of extensive consumer information and empirical collections data
designed to match the right strategy to the right consumer at the right time. Our approach to consumers is based
on obtaining an accurate understanding of their financial circumstances and is designed to identify repayment
options that achieve a beneficial outcome both for us and for the consumer, in order to foster a positive relationship
and reduce the frequency of complaints.

This data-driven approach is supported by a technologically advanced and highly automated collections
platform and implemented via a multi-channel contact strategy that utilizes call-center contact, letters, text
messages and emails. Accounts determined to have the highest propensity to pay are treated with a specific letter
and out-bound dialer strategy designed for such accounts. Less collectable accounts are treated with different
strategies that are tailored to the consumer’s financial circumstances and our business’s capacity and desire to
deploy the required resources.

    - **Letter strategies. All letters are drafted in a consumer-friendly format designed to encourage**
consumers to contact the call center. The collaborative tone of each letter is designed to engender
engagement. The approach of each letter is tailored to each consumer and determined by debt
portfolio segmentation during the book-on process.

    - **Dialer strategy. Predictive dialing is a key component of our UK Division call-center strategy,**
allowing numerous calls to be queued simultaneously and allocated to available representatives.
Our telephony system and fully automated, predictive dialer have benefited from a significant level
of investment. Key features of our telephony system and dialer include:

      - the use of a blended in-bound and out-bound dialer with the ability to prioritize valuable inbound calls;

      - the ability to automatically select and sort consumer records based on scoring and
segmentation parameters;

      - the ability to screen answer machines and unanswered calls to help ensure that representatives
maximize time spent speaking to consumers;

      - the ability to capture telephone numbers and time of day at which previous calls have been
successful for reference when each account is recycled through the dialer; and

      - the ability to route calls to representatives based on defined capability and priority parameters
(such as debt type).

Increasingly, we are investing in web, email, SMS and mobile applications to contact consumers in the
UK and allow them to communicate and pay through their preferred method of payment.

When a UK consumer engages with us by contacting a representative in our call center, the representative
who is responsible for adherence to compliance requirements has a full view of established payment plans (if
already set up by the consumer), and benefits from the use of daily-updated information about movements in a
consumer’s file. Collections performance is monitored at an account level on a daily basis using automated reports
detailing monies received in the month to date, forecast collections for the remainder of the month and expected
variances from targets by debt portfolio. We also have access to a wide range of management reports on a realtime basis and individual account details, using our business intelligence reporting software. This ability to access
information on a flexible, efficient and immediate basis is critical to allow management to design, implement and,
when required, change collection strategies on existing portfolios and pricing strategies on prospective portfolio
purchases. This also allows management to optimize value and protect returns on the debt portfolios that we own.
Our UK Division consumers’ default rate was 5.33% as of June 30, 2020, compared to 6.63% as of June 30, 2019,


-----

in each case based on a three-month average. The default rate is calculated as the percentage of payment plans
which made no payments in the month a payment was due.

With the launch of Lowell Solicitors in October 2015, our UK Division’s litigation services subsidiary,
we have leveraged their experience and expertise to pursue and develop a litigation collection process for
collection on our debt purchase portfolios in the UK. By bringing what was previously an outsourced process into
our operations, we believe we will enhance our ability to monitor and direct each step of the litigation process.
We believe that having a litigation capability in-house enables us to provide a more seamless experience for our
consumers, implement a more efficient process that will generate commercial efficiencies for investors and
improve the visibility of our control and oversight over the end-to-end collection process for our clients.

In certain situations, (e.g., when specialist collection skills may be required), we outsource some of our
UK accounts to third-party agents. Outsourced collections represented 17% of our UK Division’s Gross Debt
Purchase Collections for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Our UK Division engages DCAs either to
selectively benchmark our own performance or when the defaulted debt requires highly specialized attention and
is less cost-effective for us to pursue directly. DCAs selected to work on our behalf are subject to a stringent due
diligence process. To ensure that regulatory and compliance standards are maintained, we further maintain a
program of regular audits of the third-party DCAs we employ, which include telephone questionnaires and onsite audits during which we examine account activity and monitor live calls.

**_Our DACH Division’s Collection Process_**

In the DACH region, the unsecured consumer credit recovery cycle typically has three stages, the
characteristics of which may differ depending on factors such as collection activities already taken by the debt
originator or whether there is a fixed payment date. The three stages are: (1) ongoing accounts CMS on performing
loans and/or debt outstanding; (2) early-stage recoveries for unpaid debt within 45 days (or, in the case of
receivables sourced from the financial services industry, generally 90 days) after the payment due date for debt
that specifies a payment date; and (3) ongoing debt collection activities for defaulted debt beyond the 45-day (or,
in the case of receivables sourced from the financial services industry, generally 90-day) early-stage recovery
period. Ongoing accounts CMS is typically handled in-house, whereas debt collection services are typically
outsourced to third-party providers at the early-stage recovery phase and in the ongoing collection phase. Our
products and services in the DACH region cover the full debt recovery cycle and, in some instances, risk
management solutions implemented prior to the origination of debt, enabling us to benefit from a longer servicing
period. We believe that we also benefit from the fact that we service our owned debt portfolios through one of our
servicing subsidiaries. In doing so, we control the entire debt collection process, are able to implement optimal
third-party collection strategies and benefit from the scale of our collections operations.

Optimizing consumer contact at each stage of the collection life cycle is the key to our collection strategy.
We adapt our procedures to maximize the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable
payment plans or affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach
rather than by exploiting short-term collection potential. The process consists of the following key phases: (1) the
pre-legal or “amicable” phase; (2) the legal phase; and (3) the long-term monitoring phase. During this process,
our DACH Division has the potential to earn fees on collections by passing through statutory fees to the consumer
and earning contractually based success fees, generally during the long-term monitoring phase, from debt
originators.

    - **Pre-legal or “amicable” phase. During the pre-legal phase, our goal is to agree to a voluntary**
payment plan or settlement with the consumer. Any repayment arrangements with consumers are
structured in accordance with specific internal policy guidelines and debt originator contract
requirements, if applicable, and are designed to be sustainable and affordable for the consumer. To
enhance efficiency during the collection process, we leverage the centralized core debt
management systems of our DACH Division and the information in our extensive databases in
order to swiftly assess a consumer’s ability to pay and tailor an optimal collection strategy for each
individual consumer. Ultimately, the combination of collection methods that we use for a specific
debt originator depends on various factors, including the claim size, the debt originator we are
acting on behalf of, applicable laws and regulations, and the individual consumer.

In general, one or two days following onboarding, our DACH Division makes initial contact with the
consumer by means of a “hello” letter. If, after a maximum of one month, the consumer has not repaid or
demonstrated his or her willingness to repay the outstanding balance, we will begin to send escalation letters to
the consumer, which include tailored messages and are often sent by third-party law firms engaged by us.


-----

Beginning at the end of 2016, we have begun preparations to reduce our use of third-party law firms and have
started to transfer certain of these functions in-house. Throughout this phase, our DACH Division’s call center
personnel will contact the consumer to assess his or her willingness and ability to pay for purposes of performing
an income-expenditure assessment. Our three industrialized and automated call centers, with a total of 175 agents,
made 70 calls per agent per day in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. In addition to calling consumers, we
have also started sending text messages to consumers with a request to call back and have realized a higher
callback rate through text messages than through standard voicemail messages. Whether a voluntary payment plan
or settlement is agreed with the consumer depends on the results of our income-expenditure assessment (i.e., the
evaluation of a consumer’s willingness and ability to pay), and on any restrictions the debt originator may have
placed on us.

    - **Legal phase. Typically, three weeks after sending the escalation letters, legal action can be**
initiated on claims that have not been repaid or settled. A claim moves into the legal phase if we
determine that the consumer has the ability to pay but is otherwise unwilling to voluntarily pay, or
if we have been unable to agree to a solution with the consumer in the pre-legal phase. While we
aim to resolve claims by working with consumers without relying on legal enforcement, we will
employ legal methods if we believe that this is the optimal strategy and if the economics of the
legal proceedings are attractive to us. Examples of solutions we seek in the legal phase include
garnishment of wages, sale of collateral, bankruptcy proceedings and debt restructuring. When
legal action is taken, litigation costs are paid for by the consumer if the court decision is in the
creditor’s favor.

Prior to taking legal action, we determine whether a particular account is suitable for court action based
on a variety of factors. We assess available information about the consumer from credit bureaus, including the
consumer’s credit score and any “negative entries” showing that the consumer is vulnerable or does not have the
ability to pay. If there are negative entries indicating that legal action is inappropriate, we will transfer the account
to the long-term monitoring phase and continue to monitor it on a regular basis for any changes to the consumer’s
personal and/or financial circumstances. If we determine that a consumer’s account is suitable for legal action,
then we will seek a judicial order to pay. Our processing capabilities are enhanced by our service center, a
centralized, automated hub for managing mail, digitizing German consumer files and physically archiving court
documents.

    - **Long-term monitoring phase. The long-term monitoring phase typically commences when a**
claim is written off due to the consumer’s being insolvent and/or the claim being deemed
uncollectable. If we have obtained enforcement title to the claim, this phase can last up to 30 years.
During this phase, we monitor changes in the circumstances of the individual consumer in order to
determine whether its ability to begin payment has been enhanced. When it appears through
surveillance that a consumer’s financial position has improved, we then look to both pre-legal and
legal means to collect on the claim. We have a strong track record of collecting on older claims in
our owned debt portfolios.

We undertake substantially the same collection process in both our third-party collection services for
external clients and in collecting on our owned debt portfolios. However, when we perform third-party collection
services on behalf of our clients, we typically operate within our own guidelines regarding settlements, as well as
according to specific collections procedures. For our owned debt portfolios, we generally have the flexibility to
set guidelines regarding when to settle a claim and what procedures are utilized, subject to any contractual
limitations or other arrangements with the relevant debt originator. For example, we are typically restricted from
deploying contractors who physically visit consumers’ homes. Actions taken during the collection process are
designed to take into account any restrictions imposed by applicable laws and regulations, and to preserve our and
our clients’ reputation. For further information regarding our third-party collection services business, see “—
_Third-Party Collection Services and Other CMS Services—Third-Party Collection Services—Our DACH_
_Division’s Third-Party Collection Services.”_

**_Our Northern European Division’s Collection Process_**

The Northern European Division engages in an extensive valuation of any given portfolio in order to
determine what price we should offer the client. First, we look at certain characteristics, including the age of the
claims in the portfolio, the size of the portfolio, the type of receivable the portfolio contains and the collection
process already undertaken in order to determine whether the portfolio is suitable. Once we have determined that
a portfolio for sale is suitable, we collaborate with our debt collection team and engage in an extensive valuation


-----

of the portfolio. The Northern European Division uses multiple valuation methods and takes into account, among
other factors, the below analyses:

    - _Vintage analysis, where we use historical cash flow information to forecast future returns;_

    - _Production models, where we analyze the portfolio and makes assumptions on conversion rates_
and average payment levels using benchmark portfolios built on the basis of millions of data
points, customer information and the historical performance of its current portfolios;

    - _Debt profiles, where we identify the key value drivers in the portfolio, segment the portfolio based_
on these key value drivers and evaluate the total likely recovery for each claim;

    - _Scorecards, using all available data (internal, external and data from portfolio vendors) to evaluate_
the propensity of each customer in the portfolio to pay and to what amount; and

    - _Paying books, where we identify different payment profiles and segment accounts based on_
historical payment behavior.

The emphasis we place on each valuation method depends on the specific circumstances, information
available and characteristics of the portfolio for sale.

In conjunction with the valuation process, the Northern European Division also performs due diligence
on the portfolio prior to making a final bid. The purpose of this due diligence process is to identify any areas of
risk that would impact our ability to successfully manage the portfolio following its purchase. As part of the due
diligence process, we request and work to verify certain data fields, including claim balances, payment history on
claims, details of credit agreements and legal enforceability. Additionally, we undertake a detailed review of the
assumptions that were applied as part of the valuation process and determine whether those assumptions need to
be adjusted. For certain transactions, we also engage external advisors for this process. We seek to leverage our
relationships with clients to assist them with this process by obtaining guidance on pricing, where possible.

We believe that the Northern European Division has a competitive advantage when it is invited to bid on
a portfolio that it performs debt collection on, because we are able to accurately assess the potential in the portfolio
that can be generated given our familiarity with the debt collection measures that have been undertaken, allowing
us to accurately price the portfolio. This results in being able to confidently offer an appealing value proposition
to clients, which makes us a strong contender for portfolios that we find attractive.

Depending on the size of the transaction, the assessment and final pricing of a portfolio involves input
from the Northern European Division’s country-level management and operations, our debt purchasing and debt
collection teams, IT team and senior executives. This group works together to use the information gathered in the
process to prepare the final bid, and the relevant country level team uses its knowledge and expertise to provide a
current and accurate reflection on the competitive environment in order to ensure that any final bid is aligned with
the Group return requirement and competing offers the client is likely to receive. The final bid is determined based
on an analysis of various scenarios, which are designed to test our models at the high and low ends of prior
experience, and is evaluated and approved by pre-defined levels of management, depending on the size of the bid.
The final price that we offer for a portfolio takes into account the return that we require to compensate for the risk
present in the transaction, the possibility that actual performance of the portfolio may deviate from the expected
performance and the level of competition that we face in the market.

A key driver of the Northern European Division’s success in debt purchasing is the ability to leverage
relationships with clients. These relationships can also be used to propose alternative structures to those that were
requested if we believe this will create value for us and the client. We also frequently receive a “first and last look
opportunity” at a portfolio due to these pre-existing relationships.

After purchasing a portfolio, if the Northern European Division does not already perform debt collection
on the purchased portfolio, we must ensure that claim balances are accurately recorded, funds paid between the
determination date and the closing date by customers are received, and customers are diverted to the appropriate
phase of the collection process. We also screen individual claims against various databases to determine whether
any of the individual claims do not meet the specified criteria and should be returned, if contractually permitted.
If we already service the purchased portfolio, the risks associated with the conversion process are minimized,
since many of these steps have already been undertaken as part of its debt collection services.

_Our UK Division’s Third-Party Collection Services_

Although our UK Division primarily focuses on debt purchase, it performs limited third-party collection
services in several sectors and offers certain other CMS activities. As a result of changing legislation that allows
corporate entities to own a solicitors firm under the Alternative Business Structure (“ABS”) rules, the Solicitors
Regulation Authority (“SRA”) granted us approval in June 2015, which took effect on October 1, 2015, to
establish our own legal firm, Lowell Solicitors. Lowell Solicitors provides the majority of Litigation services to
the group in the UK. We are one of the few businesses in the UK CMS industry to have applied for and received
approval from the SRA to proceed with legal activities. The rollout of litigation capabilities is a major step towards
the expansion of our fully integrated, end-to-end CMS approach. We believe that having a litigation capability
will enable us to provide a more seamless experience for our consumers, a more efficient process that will generate
commercial efficiencies for our investors, while improving the visibility of our control and oversight over the endto-end collection process for our clients.

In July 2019, we acquired Lucas Credit Servicing, a UK DCA specializing in collections aligned to our
litigation activity. Lucas Credit Servicing predominately provides third-party collection services to our UK
Division, specifically debts proceeding through the litigation process and managed by Lowell Solicitors. Through
Lucas we also offer third-party collection services to our UK clients.

_Our DACH Division’s Third-Party Collection Services_

In the DACH region, we provide collection services to collect overdue debt and receivables both for our
clients and for our owned debt portfolios. As of June 30, 2020, we serviced 27.6 million accounts, representing
approximately 20.1 million consumer accounts within the third-party collection services business, with an
aggregate face value on open accounts of €9.9 billion (£9.0 billion equivalent) including fees, interest and costs
added to the principal amount. Our third-party collection services clients are debt originators in a range of sectors,
including primarily the financial services sector, telecommunications, utilities, services, retail, fitness, and public
sectors.

The collection process that our DACH Division uses in its third-party collection services business is
substantially similar to the collection process that it uses in its debt purchase business. For further details regarding
these collection processes, see “—Debt Purchase—Collection Process—Our DACH Division’s Collection
_Process.”_

We generate servicing fees through multiple channels, all of which are supported by the German and
Austrian legal framework for debt collection, which provides for statutory and regulation-based fees for thirdparty collection companies. The service fees we earn depend on the contractual agreements we have with our
clients. The fees that are passed on to the consumer are capped at statutory amounts under applicable regulation,
including the German Introductory Act to the Legal Services Act (Einführungsgesetz _zum_
_Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz) and the German Legal Services Act (Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetz). Fees of third-_
party collection companies are limited to the amount a lawyer could claim for similar activities and are tied to the
amount in dispute. Further fees are incurred by the consumer if a lawyer is eventually engaged in the collection
process. These fees are passed on to the consumer as an additional damage amount. For further information on
the regulatory environment in which we operate, see “Regulation.”

Our third-party collection services do not require significant ramp-up costs and are therefore less capitalintensive than debt portfolio purchases. While an owned debt portfolio is recognized on the balance sheet, thirdparty collection services can be performed with limited balance-sheet impact, which mostly relates to certain
upfront guaranteed payments on future collections that we grant some of our larger third-party collection services
clients. In such cases, we guarantee that we will successfully collect a certain percentage of the outstanding
principal amount of claims. These guaranteed payments are capitalized on our balance sheet.

In addition to managing third-party receivables through contractual relationships with our clients, we
have a successful track record of structuring a number of outsourcing deals in which we carved-out and took over
clients’ in-house collection operations. These carve-out agreements may include transferring staff and growing
the collection teams we take over. In exchange for these deals, we receive multi-year exclusive collection
agreements and access to early-stage recovery debt. Since we conducted our first transaction of this kind in 2004,


-----

we have successfully carved out CMS teams from clients within the telecommunications, insurance and financial
services industries in four additional transactions. We have secured long-term collection agreements with terms
of up to six years with the respective debt originators from which we have taken over the collection platform.
Such transactions are typically done without upfront payment to the debt originator, although we may sometimes
structure share deals equaling to the value of long-term service contracts.

We believe our carve-out platform is mutually beneficial. We enable our clients to collect more
receivables at lower cost due to our operating scale, experience, processes and tools. Long-term servicing contracts
give us earning visibility and support our future revenue and cash flow generation. Exclusive access to early-stage
debt also gives us opportunities to cross-sell other services, such as debt purchase, down the debt recovery cycle
as we gain specialized familiarity with the clients’ debt portfolio.

_Our Northern European Division’s Third-Party Collection Services_

Our Northern European Division collects overdue loans and other overdue receivables for our clients and
specializes in engineering and implementing tailored collection strategies and sustainable, affordable solutions for
the resolution of claims. The Northern European Division has third-party debt under management of €4.6 billion
(£4.2 billion equivalent) as of June 30, 2020. The experienced staff works directly to collect debt, enabling our
clients to (a) lower collection costs, due to the Northern European Division’s scale and automation of the debt
collection process; and (b) increase recovery rates, due to a combination of the Northern European Division’s
comprehensive databases and thorough understanding of our markets, which together enable us to optimally tailor
debt collection strategies.

The Northern European Division’s debt collection process is substantially standardized and automated,
with the goal of maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans
or affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach, rather than
exploiting short-term collection potential. The Northern European Division undertakes the same debt collection
process for our portfolios as we do for the overdue receivables of our clients, subject to any guidelines set by
clients regarding settlement and specific procedures to utilize. Actions taken during the debt collection process
take into account applicable country-specific laws and regulations and aim to preserve clients’ reputations.

The Northern European Division has integrated several automated processes into our debt collection
process to improve efficiency and reduce the need for manual case handling. These processes include:

    - _Standardized work processes depending on customer profile. Customer profiles and standardized_
processes determine when the Northern European Division’s agents should telephone, send a letter
to, text message or use another means to contact the customer.

    - _Campaigns. We have implemented common processes for a group of claims and campaigns will_
typically begin when the Northern European Division expects customers to have an enhanced
ability to pay.

    - _Event engines. Our software drives processes that prescribe a series of actions to be taken in_
connection with different external events, such as customer bankruptcy, death or address
modification.

    - _Robotics. We have automated business processes through the use of advanced software, which_
includes a virtual workforce that can carry out processes significantly faster than humans,
including selecting which customers to contact based on certain criteria and gathering information
and business intelligence across channels. The Northern European Division has successfully
implemented robotics in one of our markets and is currently rolling it out in the remaining markets.
Moreover, it is about to pilot intelligent automation and artificial intelligence solutions together
with an industry leading robotics vendor.

The Northern European Division’s client-centric focus is evident in our approach to fee arrangements.
During certain phases of debt collection, the Northern European Division works on a “no cure no pay” basis at
fixed rates, which means that we only get paid if we are successful in collecting the relevant debt. In other phases,
we typically work on a commission basis, taking a percentage of the cash collected from the end-customer.
Additionally, we may also offer a profit or loss sharing model, where we charge commissions on collections
received up to a certain threshold and, in addition, the client shares with the Northern European Division a
percentage of collections received over that agreed threshold.

**_Other CMS_**

_Our UK Division’s Other CMS_

In June 2014, our UK Division introduced a suite of value-added services (branded “Accumulus”) that
are specifically targeted at strengthening client relationships. They provide bespoke data and technology solutions
that add value to the client throughout the clients’ credit life-cycle. These services, which we offer free of charge
to certain of our debt originator clients, are complementary to our collection services offerings and facilitate our
strategy of further embedding ourselves in our clients’ CMS chain.

_Our DACH Division’s Other CMS_

In addition to our core third-party collection services and debt purchase businesses, we also provide a
suite of further value-added services to our DACH Division’s clients. Our other services primarily cover three
areas: risk management solutions, e-commerce solutions and data information services. Examples of these
services include OrderCheck (which performs consumer default risk assessment before order execution for online
payments) and the ClientMatching service (which matches known consumers with e-commerce sector clients).
The commissions we generate for running credit checks are recorded as revenue in our third-party collection
services business. However, the defaulted debt acquired is recorded in the debt purchase business, which, in
accordance with statutory reporting rules, is immediately recognized with an impairment from the face value of
the debt. In addition, we offer logistical and administrative services to the external lawyers we engage.

_Our Northern European Division’s Other CMS_

The Northern European Division also offers a wide range of information, payment and invoicing services
before debt is considered non-performing.

    - _Information services. Information services include credit information and analysis, data extraction_
and modelling and scorecard input and development. These services enable clients to mitigate
credit risk and reduce potential losses from sales to new clients by providing efficient and reliable
information on the creditworthiness of their customers.

    - _Invoicing services. Invoicing services include invoicing and reminder services. We believe that the_
Northern European Division’s invoicing services provide reliable and cost efficient solutions for
clients with high invoicing volumes and help clients to increase sales by enabling credit sales with
limited credit risk or need for a credit process.

**Decision Science**

Decision Science is our advanced analytics function, focused on understanding, measuring and predicting
consumer financial behavior, especially within subprime credit, financially distressed and low- and moderateincome populations. The team comprises data scientists, statisticians, data engineers and business analysts
dedicated to addressing the company’s most challenging analytic problems. From asset pricing through
sophisticated consumer segmentation schemes to the development of operational and forecasting models that
enhance collections performance, the team uses mathematics, psychology, economics and raw business acumen
to support the needs of our pan-European business.

Decision Science is a Group function that includes approximately 40 analytic staff organized into four
distinct subteams: (1) Pricing and Investments, (2) Consumer Insight, (3) Portfolio Forensics and Business
Analysis and (4) Operations and Technology. Across subteams and geographies, the team is dedicated to
combining the best of regional expertise with centralized best practices.

**_Pricing and Investments_**

_Teams in Leeds (UK), Essen (Germany), Stockholm (Sweden) and Turku (Finland)_

The Pricing and Investments team is responsible for calculating prices for portfolios of charged-off
consumer debt and providing analytic and project oversight support for high-value business and financial projects.
The work is underpinned by sophisticated statistical models that estimate a portfolio’s value within our collections
environment and bolstered by a variety of advantages depending on operating region. For example, in the UK, the
pricing models benefit from our exceptional consumer match rate (the proportion of accounts in a portfolio that


-----

can be associated with existing consumer data), which has grown from 46% as of December 31, 2013 to 62% as
of June 30, 2020, which we believe exceeds the match rate of our competitors.

**_Consumer Insight_**

_Teams in Leeds (UK), Essen (Germany), Stockholm (Sweden) and Amsterdam (Netherlands)_

Consumer Insight is responsible for delivering powerful data science insights and advanced analytical
solutions using statistical and machine learning methods. In particular, the team is focused on consumer
segmentation, operational scorecard development, data mining, visualization, conducting random tests and
identifying new data sources, tools and approaches. In addition to qualified business experts, Consumer Insight
includes approximately 10 Ph.D.-level scientists trained in a variety of quantitative and behavioral disciplines. All
team members leverage a range of advanced computation tools (e.g., Python, R, SAS, databricks, TensorFlow,
Jira, and Azure Machine Learning). Our modelers use these tools to complete complex analytic tasks and produce
sophisticated propensity-to-pay scorecards that are used across the entire business, from ranking consumers on
their willingness- and ability- to-pay to constructing “effort sloping” scores designed to optimize an account’s net
present value in collections. Consumer Insight activities include equal measures of operations-focused, applied
modelling work and theoretical, research-based projects, thereby ensuring that current business needs are met
while building a pipeline for future growth and innovation.

**_Portfolio Forensics and Business Analysis_**

_Team in Leeds (UK)_

The Portfolio Forensics and Business Analysis team leads analytic projects that improve business
profitability and operational processes and provides operational surveillance and support for complex corporate
initiatives. Leveraging the same advanced tools used by consumer insight, the team builds and maintains asset
health indicators (to understand segment-specific and overall portfolio risk), develops tools to ensure the
collections teams are maximizing account-level NPV, identifying opportunities to improve consumer outcomes
and helps ensure that consumer accounts, treatment strategies and operational performance metrics are well
aligned. This team also partners closely with our finance team to ensure that our ERC calculations and revaluation
process remain highly accurate.

**_Operations and Technology_**

_Team in Leeds (UK) and Amsterdam (Netherlands)_

The Decision Science Operations and Technology team directs delivery of the Decision Science business
plan, leads communications and consulting support for the department, is responsible for analytic talent programs
and provides expert resources to our operating businesses (through Lowell Labs Amsterdam). The team is also
directing a pan-European, multi-year (2019-2021) initiative to modernize our data and analytic infrastructure.
Working closely with the finance, legal and compliance departments, the Operations and Technology team is
responsible for Decision Science’s risk management and control activities, and creates and delivers content to
promote Decision Science within the Group.

Located in Amsterdam, Lowell Labs opened in January 2019 as a data science center of excellence
focused on creating new insights about consumer credit data, segmentation and financial behavior. Our
Amsterdam colleagues are fully-integrated members of Decision Science and support our core operating
geographies by delivering high-quality analyses focused on asset pricing, predictive modelling, data mining and
financial forecasting. As a space devoted to advanced statistics, machine learning methods and applied consumer
science, we believe Lowell Labs is unique within our industry and a reflection of our commitment to analytic
excellence.

**Consumer Data Asset**

We believe that success in our business depends on establishing and maintaining an information
advantage, and our advanced analytics, business reporting, operational analytics and collections platform leverage
one of Europe’s deepest pools of consumer credit data to deliver new business insights that benefit consumers,
clients and our core business.

The Group’s significant presence in its market has resulted in its having had an information-based
relationship with approximately 21% of all adult consumers in the countries where we have an operating presence.


-----

On a regional basis, this equates to the Group having had a relationship with approximately 1 in 4 adult consumers
in the UK, 1 in 5 adult consumers in Germany and 1 in 11 adult consumers in Northern Europe. The Group
continues to benefit from the information-based relationship it has across its regions and across the 22.2 million
active accounts within its owned debt portfolios. Depending on region, these data span hundreds or thousands of
modelling features and analytic variables, and include credit bureau, third-party sourced and our proprietary and
performance data. Moreover, each year we make significant investments in credit bureau and customized
consumer data that describe demographic, account-level, and macroeconomic factors related to credit, savings
and payment behavior. Additionally, we constantly refresh our data allowing us to build longitudinal trajectories
and detailed customer journeys that improve modelling accuracy, provide a significant competitive advantage
over other participants in the CMS market and help us make our relationship to consumers fair, appropriate,
sensible, and compliant.

**Analytic Technology Platform**

The Decision Science team benefits from significant investments made to modernize our data and
analytic infrastructure. Using proven cloud technologies has increased automation and reduced manual data
handing. As a result, managers, data scientists and analysts can more quickly produce insights, statistical models,
and machine learning models, which further increases the volume of insights and models delivered and increases
the rate-of-learning through faster feedback loops.

As well as improving speed and productivity, the quality of insights has improved through on-demand
access to the most modern data and analytic tooling. These tools include state-of-the-art programming frameworks
(such as python and R), full use of open-source libraries (such as pandas, NumPy, and SciPy), all modern machinelearning frameworks (such as AzureML, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Caffe2), modern collaboration tooling
(such as Jupyter, git, and Jira), and modern orchestration and release (such as Azure DevOps and Kubernetes).

**Geographic Footprint and Operating Subsidiaries**

We are generally focused on promoting growth in core activities and businesses while exiting non-core
activities. We have focused on growing our core debt purchase business through transactions such as the
acquisition of Lowell Sverige and Lowell AS, as well as growth through purchasing of portfolios.

As of June 30, 2020, we had four trading entities in the UK, 19 operating entities in Germany, four
operating entities in Austria, two operating entities in Denmark, three trading entities in Norway, one operating
entity in Sweden, two operating entities in Finland and one operating entity in Switzerland, as well as an operating
entity in Croatia, as shown in the following table:

**Clients**

We engage with clients across a range of industries and hold leading positions in the telecommunications
and retail sectors in the UK and leading, top-five, or top-ten market share positions across a number of sectors in
Germany, including the financial services, insurance, retail, e-commerce, telecommunications, fitness, public and
utilities sectors. We believe that our diversification across numerous sectors decreases our exposure to changes in
any one industry.

Our UK Division has strong client relationships across several sectors, such as the financial services,
home retail credit, telecommunications and utilities sectors. We have purchased debt portfolios from 80 clients
since our inception in 2004, and our average relationship length was eight years as of June 30, 2020. During the
twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we purchased debt portfolios from 27 clients with which we have active
relationships, and many of these active clients are major companies with which we have established a long-term
relationship.

Our DACH Division has a client base of several thousand throughout the large, well-known client and
small and medium enterprise segments, with the top five clients representing approximately 48% of our income
in our DACH Division third-party collection services business for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. We
provided services to a number of large, well-known clients in 2019. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020,
59% of our third-party services income was generated from clients with which we had held a relationship for five
years or more.

Moreover, our DACH Division maintains a broad sector coverage based on 3PC income for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2020, generating a split amongst our clients across several industries, including financial
services (51%), telecommunications (6%), retail (11%) and other (33%). As of June 30, 2020, we believe we held
top-tier positions in the insurance and fitness sectors and top-five positions in the banking, e-commerce,
telecommunications and utilities, as well as top-ten positions in the retail and public sectors in Germany.

The Northern European Division’s client base consists of leading national and international financial
institutions, insurance companies, utilities providers, public sector, telecommunications companies and
companies in the retail sector. We have a special focus on financial institutions, many of whom we have long

-----

standing relationships with, as this is an attractive sector due to, among other factors, high industry growth rates,
responsible origination practices and stable and predictable cash flows. At the same time, however, we have
expanded our sector expertise over the past few decades by carve-outs of clients’ in-house collection department
or by acquiring smaller specialist players in what remains a fragmented market. The Northern European Division’s
five largest third-party collection service clients together represented approximately 4% of its total cash income
for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. We benchmark performance against third-party debt collection
competitors and regularly monitor our operations to confirm that we are in compliance with contracts in order to
ensure these strong relationships continue.

At the Group level, we have improved our new client relationships and client onboarding. We have a
strong track record in maintaining long-standing relationships with our clients across all sectors that we operate
in.

**Marketing and Client Relations**

We place great emphasis on the strength of our marketing and client relationships. We foster long-term,
strategic relationships with clients across many sectors, including financial services, retail, telecommunications
and utilities. We believe that caring for existing clients contributes to increased trust, which in turn results in a
larger number of long-term relationships and new business opportunities. In addition, we strive to invest in valueadded partnerships and products that enhance our ability to serve our clients.

We believe that our transparent approach to client management enhances the strength of our client
relationships. Regular performance reviews are carried out with all clients, with the frequency determined by the
client as well as the strategic importance of the relationship to us. Unique performance reviews include analysis
of portfolio performance, consumer treatment, post-sale administration, future pipeline initiatives/developments,
business updates and suggestions for further interaction/enhancements to the relationship.

Our UK Division has been externally recognized and named as Debt Purchaser of the Year 2019 and
awarded Best Use of Technology 2019 by Credit Strategy. We place a particular emphasis on securing long-term
forward flow agreements with clients, with some contracts running for five years and an average contract length
of approximately three years as of June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, approximately 43% of our UK Division’s
cumulative portfolio purchases since inception were made pursuant to through forward flows, which management
believes to be higher than any other debt purchaser in the UK. In the four years ended December 31, 2019, 50%
of our UK Division’s re-tendered forward flow agreements have been renewed at least once.

We employ a dedicated sector management strategy with clients, backed up by senior executive
relationships within the company. In addition, we have client relationships across many functions, including
operations, compliance and external recoveries, with central coordination via our sales and business development
team. Since June 2014, we have offered our clients a suite of value-added services that are specifically targeted at
strengthening our partnerships through providing bespoke data and technology solutions that add value to the
client throughout the consumer credit life-cycle. See “—Third-Party Collection Services and Other CMS—Other
_CMS.”_

Our DACH Division employs a comprehensive and coordinated approach to marketing and client
relations. We have developed marketing and sales strategies that are tailored to each client sector including the
energy, utilities, e-commerce, banking, payments and other sectors. We are also connected to the start-up sector,
a connection which provides us with the opportunity to leverage strongly growing businesses and utilize multiplier
partnerships. In addition to our in-house sales team of dedicated sector specialized sales managers, we have
external sales representatives who support our sales efforts in specific industries. We have a carefully selected
internal sales team consisting of dedicated sales managers who specialize in specific industries and are dedicated
to finding solutions to customers’ problems and concerns. This sales team builds networks across sectors, bringing
together contacts from different areas. Our operational centers have a strong sector expertise needed to support
the industry specific approach. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we held an average relationship length
of 8.8 years with our DACH Division’s top ten vendors by debt purchase income. For the twelve months ended
June 30, 2020, 13% of our DACH Division’s portfolio purchases were derived from clients with which we had
held a relationship for five years or more.

The Northern European Division organizes its sales and marketing efforts on a country level and on a
pan-Northern European basis in combination. The sales force is organized into new sales and key account
management. The sales staff reports to local country sales managers who, in turn, report dually to the Country
Management and to the Nordic Head of Clients and Sales. In addition, there are individuals dedicated to client


-----

delivery management, who are tasked with ensuring that its production delivers best-in-class service levels. The
sales staff consists of highly skilled professionals with strong client and industry expertise, and with a particular
focus on financial services.

The Northern European Division’s client relationships are both broad and deep. We build relationships
with clients on all relevant levels within the country organizations, ranging from purchasing/procurement and
operations level and credit management, to finance and treasury functions and senior executive level.

The Northern European Division’s dedicated client focus and track record of delivering top tier services
have led to long-standing client relationships. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 55% of our 3PC income
was generated from clients with which we had held a relationship for five years or more.

**Compliance and Risk Management**

Compliance is central to our operations. We believe that our focus on compliance resonates with debt
originators and is essential for providers of CMS to succeed in an increasingly regulated market. Our focus on
compliance means that “treating customers fairly” is embedded within our day-to-day processes.

We have a clear governance structure and experienced senior management across all parts of our
organization, so that all key components of the business receive appropriate attention. Our centralized operational
risk management and compliance functions ensure central implementation of requirements and guidelines, as well
as standardized risk policy and measures. Our compliance operations have been designed with a focus on three
main objectives: to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to enforce a fair treatment of
consumers and to preserve our reputation and the reputations of our clients. Our key areas of risk management
include data protection, anti-money laundering and fraud prevention.

Each of our divisions’ managing directors are responsible for the overall effectiveness of risk
management and compliance throughout our operating entities and are under the supervision of our regional
supervisory boards. In addition to regional governance structures, we have a Group Audit Committee that supports
the internal audit functions in the UK Division, DACH Division and Northern European Division by conducting
group audits based on an annual group audit plan. In addition, as part of the annual accounting close, external
auditors conduct a review of the adequacy of the risk management and compliance functions.

Our approach to compliance includes a “three lines of defense” model to promote a strong compliance
culture: (1) “Operational Controls,” (2) “Accountable for Oversight” and (3) “Accountable for Assurance.” The
first line of defense, Operational Controls, focuses on operational adherence to compliance requirements and is
achieved through reporting by the operations team and monitoring by team leaders and by the quality assurance
team, including call-quality monitoring. The second line of defense, Accountable for Oversight, focuses on quality
assurance through managerial oversight of operational activity and review of the control testing of the first line of
defense. The third line of defense, Accountable for Assurance, comprises internal audit and consists of reviewing
and assessing the adequacy of controls in place.

**_Our UK Division’s Compliance and Risk Management_**

Our UK Division maintains a dedicated compliance team of approximately 103 FTEs as of June 30,
2020, up from 43 FTEs in 2013, which actively promotes compliance best practices across the business and seeks
to achieve low rates of complaints. For example, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our UK Division
achieved a rate of 0.3% for internal complaints.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our FOS-filed complaint ratio was low, with 11.9 cases per
1,000,000 financial services accounts. We work with consumers to obtain debt repayment in a proactive and
supportive way based on data intelligence, analytics and, in the vast majority of cases, without the need to use
litigation. Since our UK Division’s inception in May 2004, we have never faced any enforcement actions by any
of the entities that regulate our operations, including the OFT and the FCA. We are a member of the Consumer
Credit Trade Association, Civil Courts Users Association and Finance and Leasing Association. As a full member
of the Credit Services Association, we comply with certain codes of practice. In addition, in April 2013, we
launched our FAIR program, which outlines our policies on treating consumers fairly, consumer focused behavior,
fair outcomes, assessing affordability and responding to client audits.

Furthermore, our investment in operations has improved compliance oversight throughout our collections
process. For example, we record all calls with our speech analytics and call-monitoring systems. We have also
invested in teams to monitor performance and fill roles poorly suited to automation, such as manual pre-litigation


-----

checking. We believe that our account databases also represent a source of compliance advantage, providing better
data to inform decisions as to whether to seek collection, the most appropriate collection approach and the
consumer’s likely ability to repay. Accounts are selected for litigation as a last resort when they have reached the
end of an alternative strategy and a consumer has not engaged with us or made a reasonable offer of repayment.
Selection involves a combination of quality, policy and scoring processes to ensure that only consumers that we
believe are in a position to pay are selected. Automation of selection ensures consistent application of rules to
exclude, for example, vulnerable consumers or those with a negative disposable income where this has been
captured during any contact. Credit bureau data is used to verify the consumer’s whereabouts and the status of
their credit profile which is taken into account when scoring for suitability. Prior to the commencement of any
action, a manual sample check of selected accounts is made to ensure the integrity of the process before accounts
are approved for release into the process by the Director of Business Optimisation and the Director of Litigation.

We believe that our significant investment in operations has helped create an industry standard in
compliance practices, with regular recognition for our strong focus on fair practices with respect to our clients,
consumers and regulators. In 2016, our UK Division was awarded an “Exceptional” rating by Investors in
Customers (“IIC”), a UK customer-experience consultancy. This was the second time we were awarded the rating.
Our initial award, the first in our industry, was awarded in 2014. This has been followed by a “Gold Award” in
2017 (IIC have replaced their previous “star” ratings with bronze, silver and gold awards and Lowell was the first
company to receive the Gold Award). Our UK Division also received a “Gold for Investors in Customers” award
in 2018, “Debt Purchase Provider of the Year” in 2019, and “Best Use of Technology” for our roll out of Robotic
Process Automation 2019, in each case from IIC, and benefits from a Trustpilot (a consumer review website)
rating of 4.4/5 stars.

**_Our DACH Division’s Compliance and Risk Management_**

We believe a focus on compliance and risk management is critical for our business, as our clients regard
our ethical behavior and strict compliance with laws and regulations as essential in order for them to utilize our
services. A strong compliance culture is an increasingly important differentiating factor in the highly competitive
and fragmented German debt collection market, as smaller players typically have weaker compliance systems and
debt originators are increasingly more focused on reputation, compliance track record and audit trail. All of our
processes incorporate what we believe to be leading compliance standards, which enable us to preserve our
reputation and the reputation of our clients. We believe that our compliance culture reflects our beliefs in: taking
a fair and reasonable stance when interacting with consumers; ensuring a fair outcome for the consumer; taking
into account sustainability and affordability of payments; and treating consumers with respect and dignity.

Our central Risk and Compliance function led by the DACH Chief Risk & Compliance officer
contributes strongly to the management of our key compliance focus areas such as data protection, anti-money
laundering as well as fraud prevention which are for many years already supported by mature data protection and
anti-money laundering structures. The current DACH Division risk register is continuously updated by the
responsible central risk managers. This enables the group to take the appropriate preventive actions regarding
internal and external risks. This also enables the group to encourage good business decisions based on risk
transparency. In the exercise of their duties, our managing directors as well as the Risk & Compliance Division
are supported by the DACH Risk & Control Committee as well as the Group Risk Committee.

We believe that our compliance structure contributes to our low consumer complaints track record. In
2014, Standard & Poor’s rated our DACH Division with the best possible “Strong” servicer rating as a special
servicer of consumer finance, based on two of our major subsidiaries (PCS and SIR). The outstanding servicer
rating result by has been confirmed once again in August 2018. In addition, our DACH Division received, on
average, only 0.01% new consumer complaints per year as a percentage of active accounts for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2020. For further information on the regulatory environment that we operate under, see
“Regulation.”

**_Our Northern European Division’s Compliance and Risk Management_**

The Northern European Division has risk management frameworks that have been well established from
decades of experience to identify, mitigate and manage risk. We have an embedded risk a management culture
within these business units, effective risk management and compliance processes, such as training programs for
employees and self-imposed regulatory controls, and an independent audit function with reporting lines to the
management. The Northern European Division has a strong culture of consumer compliance seeking to offer
debtors the best possible customer journey and supporting them in rebuilding a healthy personal financial profile.


-----

The Northern European Division has also invested significantly into individual compliance training and instilling
a strong customer centric corporate culture, leading to positive customer feedback.

The Northern European Division’s clients deem its ethical behavior and strict compliance with laws and
regulations as essential in order for them to utilize our services. The laws and regulations that we operate under
have at their core the fair treatment of all customers, which we have sought to integrate into day-to-day operations
and culture. Our debt collection process is designed to yield financial results while protecting clients’ reputations.
The Northern European Division’s collection process is centered around:

    - polite persistence, where collectors take a fair and reasonable stance when interacting with
customers;

    - ensuring a fair outcome for the customer, taking into account sustainability and affordability of
payments; and

    - treating customers with respect and dignity.

The Northern European Division has robust internal compliance standards, which are applicable to all
employees and all employees are expected to become acquainted with and comply with these standards. The
standards regarding regulatory compliance define, among other things, governing principles regarding
identification of governing laws and regulations, delegation of compliance responsibilities, guidelines on
education and competence, testing and documentation of regulatory compliance control measures. On a yearly
basis, a compliance self-assessment and review process is conducted with the purpose of providing management
with an objective assessment of the status of compliance with regards to legislation and regulation, as well as
internal governance principles, policies and procedures. The findings of the assessment supported by the Nordic
Risk & Control Committee as well as the Group Risk Committee enable senior management to initiate any
necessary remedial activities.

The Northern European Division has invested heavily in compliance systems and controls, as well as the
training of employees, to increase awareness of regulatory requirements and policies. We provide comprehensive
training to employees on legal and regulatory compliance. Through training sessions, it is our goal to provide an
insight into, and gain an understanding of, an employee’s obligations in ensuring legal and regulatory compliance.
We also require our employees to complete a designated compliance module and complete regular interactive
refreshers and tests.

For further information on the regulatory environment under which the Northern European Division
operates, see “Regulation.”

**Technology Infrastructure**

Our business models, including debt purchase, third-party collection services and litigation services, are
supported by a sophisticated technology landscape, which has received continuous and balanced investment.

Our UK, DACH and Northern European Divisions share best practices and technology infrastructure
between them. Our business strategy is based on sustaining a continuously improving technology infrastructure,
with our IT organization focused on the goals of centralization, standardization, scalability, security and high
availability. We leverage a blend of sophisticated proprietary systems and partnerships with technology industry
leaders in order to achieve these goals. Our IT department is focused on:

_Provision of IT services. Our IT organization has a centralized model that covers technical services,_
change management, application management and service management in each of our UK, DACH and Northern
European Divisions. The centralized model enforces common IT strategy, policies, methodologies, standards and
consistency across processes and tools, thus helping to ensure economies of scale, cost savings and cost avoidance
across IT services. It also allows us to implement an effective segregation of duties, which increases confidence
in accountability and quality controls.

In support of our internal governance and management framework, we have obtained various
accreditations with respect to industry standards, such as PCI DSS compliance (credit card standards), ISO27001
(IT security) and ISO9001 (quality management).

_Industrialized infrastructure. We aim to provide industry-leading IT infrastructure services, which_
include a scalable, resilient and highly available data center (with a private cloud) and wide area data network,


-----

with full disaster recovery services and an around-the-clock service-management model. Our global partner
Fujitsu provides a 24-hour security operations center and network operations center.

Our strategic IT infrastructure service providers include Fujitsu, Vodafone, IBM, Interoute, Advania,
Rackspace, Maintel and SunGard Recovery Services. Fujitsu provides private, public and hybrid Cloud and
Infrastructure Managed Services which provide the private cloud for our data center and disaster recovery services
for the UK and Northern European Divisions, they are the third-largest global infrastructure services provider and
provide both service management and service desk management. Vodafone provides the hosted cloud services for
the DACH Division, working on similar contract and service schedules as Fujitsu, which provides further
convergence opportunities for the future. Maintel, in partnership with industry-leading telecommunications
companies, is our data network service provider for the UK Division. Vodafone provides these services for the
DACH Division and Interoute provides these services for the Northern European Division. SunGard provides
enterprise-level business continuity management services ensuring ‘on-tap’ connectivity to our core environment
in the event of site failure.

Our IT infrastructure services are fully implemented, with our UK Division’s operational since 2014, our
DACH Division’s operational since 2018 and our Northern European Division’s operational since 2019. Our
infrastructure model provides strategic flexibility: the services are “location independent,” providing flexibility to
the business in support of future acquisition and location strategies. Our IT infrastructure partnership hosts all of
our UK, Northern European and DACH applications and data, resulting in cost savings, cost avoidance and
increased security and resilience.

We are committed to maintaining high standards of data protection, client information and information
security. All cloud infrastructure and systems are protected by multiple layers of security technologies providing
a defense in depth approach and are constantly updated to avoid cyber-attacks. We have a dedicated Chief
Information & Security Officer with a team of security experts that have developed our Cyber Security Strategy
and increased our protection with enhanced processes, tools and monitoring and awareness and education of
security risks.

_Application rationalization. We have undertaken a major application rationalization program since 2015,_
including the refresh of the IT Technical Architecture, a new messaging system and standard business-toconsumer (“B2C”) and business-to-business (“B2B”) portal architecture. The UK Division has rationalized on a
single collections system for the support of debt purchase and servicing models. Through the acquisition of Lucas
Collections the UK Division has a new litigation system with modern portal architecture to support this business
model. In Northern Europe, the collections application is being rationalized to one platform to serve both debt
purchase and debt servicing models. In the DACH Division, using modern architecture the technology landscape
will provide more digital channels and business processing capabilities than the current collection platforms. The
Group IT Convergence Strategy (2020 – 2023) continues to enhance the roadmap across applications, digital
space, infrastructure, telephony, data, suppliers and security to identify consolidation and simplification
opportunities. Through such enhancement and convergence, application and infrastructure simplification is
expected to improve productivity in our delivery of technology solutions and lower the costs associated with the
development of these solutions by allowing us to more fully adopt a “build once, use many times” approach when
adding functionality to our IT systems. For example, a single new account services function is now used by three
different business applications. We believe application simplification will also reduce data replication through
facilitating an increasingly centralized approach to data management services, and we believe this, in turn, will
both reduce expenses associated with our data management services and help to ensure data-retention policies are
effective. We have a program delivering data lake solutions that can be adopted across all the Divisions. The
adoption of AI and deep machine learning will be part of the new data lake management services, enhancing our
decision science capabilities as well as operational analytics and business intelligence capabilities. A number of
business solutions that make use of external technology have been enabled by this strategy, including our use of
BLAZE, a contact strategy decision engine from leading U.S.-based software provider FICO (Fair Isaac
Corporation). We believe that the use of BLAZE has promoted our use of contact strategies that are tailored to a
consumer’s individual needs and circumstances and thereby helped to reduce expenses, for example by providing
information that will allow us to avoid unnecessary letters and improved collections. We are considering using
BLAZE as the standard decision engine across all the Divisions. Other solutions include new platforms for our
external recoveries (AMOS), digital processes and query management system, all of which we believe will
provide net benefits.

We believe we will be able to continue to extend Caseflow (UK), our proprietary collections and
consumer management application, to support other critical business functions.


-----

The ultimate goal of these initiatives is to provide a centralized consumer management system that will
shift away from an account-focused processing toward a single consumer view and consumer-based processing.
By implementing a single consumer view, we believe we will be able to make our UK Division’s core operational
processes more efficient for both us and our consumers by enabling initiatives such as single consumer lettering,
which was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, which consolidates a consumer’s multiple account details
onto a single letter, thereby reducing cost and improving the consumer experience. In addition, we also believe
we will be able to decommission other existing systems, which we anticipate will lead to cost savings.

Through constant analysis and review we continue to identify waste and replication and remove it
efficiently as part of our best practice data management approach. A measurement of this approach has been the
removal of a significant number of replica and ineffective data stores.

_Extended consumer self-service via an enhanced digital channel. An improved B2C channel, which was_
implemented in November 2015, and refreshed in 2019, has provided an enhanced consumer experience involving
more self-service capability and an improved look and feel. This solution completely replaced the previous B2C
channel, and features improved security features, consumer discounts, straight-through processing of payments
and changes to consumer details, uninterrupted availability, a consumer budget planner and many other features.
The channel is accessible from various mobile devices and supports different internet browsers. Further releases
are expected to provide mobile-specific applications and the ability to deliver online letters and statements, as
well as support marketing and letter strategies. We are also looking at a multi-channel strategy, which will bring
all of our consumer communication channels under a single cohesive structure that provides consistency and
accuracy across all consumer interactions.

**Workforce**

As of June 30, 2020, we had 3,966 FTEs (down from 4,340 as of June 30, 2019), of which 1,669, 1,427
and 870 were located in the UK, DACH and Northern European Divisions, respectively. On a group-wide basis,
we are committed to recruiting, training, developing and retaining employees. Our management team believes
that our recruitment and training programs provide a competitive advantage to our business, as management
encourages our agents to achieve results by building a relationship with the consumer, while maintaining a record
of compliance with laws and regulations.

Furthermore, our DACH Division was certified as a “Top Employer” in Germany by the Top Employers
Institute alongside certain blue-chip companies, reflecting our ability to attract talent and sector expertise. Our
UK Division currently holds Investor in People Gold status, which recognizes the company’s high standards of
people management and development.

**Litigation**

From time to time we are party to various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
our business. Within the past twelve months we have not been, and are not currently, a party to any governmental,
legal, administrative, arbitration or dispute proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, that have had, or
are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial position or profitability, nor, so far as we are aware,
are any such proceedings pending or threatened.

**Insurance**

Our insurance policies include insurance to cover risks associated with our businesses, including general
liability, crime, professional liability and directors’ and officers’ liability. We believe that the types and amounts
of insurance coverage that we maintain are consistent with customary industry standards in the markets in which
we operate. However, no assurances can be given that we will continue to maintain current levels of insurance
coverage. A successful claim of sufficient magnitude that is not covered, or only partially covered by insurance,
could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition. Furthermore, our insurance policies do not
cover any violation of representations and warranties in debt purchase contracts. In addition, we did not take out
insurance for our representations and warranties in the purchase agreements related to the disposal of certain
former group companies.

**Real Property**

**_Our UK Division’s Real Property_**

Our UK Division currently leases its headquarters and call centers, located at Ellington House, 9
Savannah Way, Leeds Valley Park, Leeds LS10 1AB, United Kingdom and Darwin House, 7 Savannah Way,
Leeds Valley Park, Leeds LS10 1AB, United Kingdom, which are used for our day-to-day operation. Our UK
Division’s property portfolio is managed internally by its facilities team, supported by external specialists where
appropriate. This team is responsible for ensuring that each site is in compliance with statutory requirements,
including health and safety requirements.

**_Our DACH Division’s Real Property_**

Our DACH Division operates its businesses at premises that are leased from third parties pursuant to 75
lease agreements (including expansions of existing lease arrangements), mainly for fixed terms, relating to 14
operating locations, offices and IT storage facility. Our DACH Division does not own any real estate. We believe
that we have entered into the lease agreements on customary terms. Although some of the lease agreements may
not be renewed at the end of their respective terms, our DACH Division’s operations would not be disrupted if it
decided not to renew the leases or if the leases were cancelled.

**_Our Northern European Division’s Real Property_**

The Northern European Division currently leases its headquarters and call centers, located in Norway,
Denmark, Finland and Sweden, which are used for its day-to-day operation. The Northern European Division’s
property portfolio is managed internally by its facilities team, supported by external specialists where appropriate.
This team is responsible for ensuring that each site is in compliance with statutory requirements, including health
and safety requirements.

**Intellectual Property**

Our UK Division owns 47 trademarks (38 UK trademarks and 9 EU trademarks). The majority of the
trademarks used by our UK Division are owned by Lowell Group Limited, Lowell Holdings Limited and Lowell
Financial Ltd. Additionally, we hold 102 active domain names. Our DACH Division holds 12 trademarks (seven
German trademarks and five EU trademarks) and 187 active domain names. Our Northern European Division
holds four active domain names. We are not aware of any legal disputes regarding intellectual property, whether
pending or threatened in writing, to which we are or may become a party. Additionally, we have not been provided
with information about any actual or potential infringement of intellectual property rights owned or used by any
third party for which we may be held responsible. There are various licenses within our UK Division allowing
intellectual property rights to be used within the group in the ordinary course of business. Our DACH Division
and Northern European Division do not currently license out their intellectual property, except for the licensing
of standard and proprietary software products by their operating entity, ITT, to its clients in the ordinary course
of business.

**REGULATION**

**Key Regulations Affecting Our UK Division**

The UK CMS industry is highly regulated. The regulatory environment for debt collection and debt
purchase in the UK requires considerable investment in processes, knowhow and management. Our management
believes that the regulatory environment fundamentally creates strong barriers to entry. Debt originators are
increasingly careful in their selection of their debt collector partners, and those who can demonstrate robust
compliance processes are favored. The key entities and laws that govern our business are set out below.

**_The Financial Conduct Authority_**

The FCA is the current regulator of consumer credit in the UK. The FCA took over regulation of the
consumer credit industry, including the debt sector, from the OFT on April 1, 2014. Consumer credit agencies
and those conducting business in the debt sector are now subject to a statutory regime under the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”). Pursuant to the FSMA, in order to carry on consumer credit activities, a firm
needs to be authorized by FCA (instead of being licensed by the OFT as was formerly the case) or otherwise be
exempt. FSMA and its related secondary legislation is supported by the detailed FCA Handbook of Rules and
Guidance (the “FCA Rules”) and the associated FCA supervision and enforcement powers. As a result, the
regulation of consumer credit activity is aligned in large part with the current regulatory regime for banks,
insurance and investment firms. At the same time, however, many of the specific statutory requirements governing
consumer credit activity under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (“CCA”) and its secondary legislation continue to
co-exist alongside the FSMA regime, with the FCA assuming the OFT’s former responsibility regarding
enforcement of this legislation.

As a result of the transfer of the old Financial Services Authority’s functions now being split between
the FCA for conduct matters and the Prudential Regulation Authority, for prudential matters (with the latter’s
responsibilities confined mainly to banking and insurance), the FCA has been granted enhanced enforcement
powers and is taking a more proactive and interventionist approach to regulation and enforcement than its
predecessor. The FCA’s enforcement powers and approach is significantly enhanced from that of the old OFT.
The FCA has broad investigative and disciplinary powers, including the power to impose fines and vary or cancel
regulatory permissions. Failure to comply with the FCA rules could lead to liability for damages to third parties,
disciplinary action, public censures, fines, the imposition of other penalties, customers being compensated for
losses, or the revocation or variation of authorizations to conduct business, in whole or in part both on regulated
firms and their employees.

For firms which it regulates, the FCA’s strategic objective is to ensure that the markets which it regulates
function well. The FCA also has three key operational objectives:

    - to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers;

    - to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and

    - to promote effective competition in the interests of customers for regulated financial services or
services carried out by regulated investment exchanges.

Under the FCA regime, historical requirements applicable to us will continue to apply under the CCA,
along with requirements deriving from the FSMA and the FCA Rules. In the latter case, many of the FCA
requirements are similar to those that apply already to banks and other regulated financial services firms. In
addition, the FCA has created a sector-specific Consumer Credit sourcebook (“CONC”), which applies
specifically to consumer credit firms such as ourselves. Among other things, CONC incorporates some of the
previous CCA provisions and historic OFT guidance, in many cases as rules. The FCA’s stated general approach
to retaining OFT guidance has been to carry it across to CONC in substantially the same form and with
substantially the same effect as previously.

To date, the FCA has focused both on specific sectors in the consumer credit industry (including, for example, the
high-cost short-term credit, rent-to-own, logbook loan, home-collected credit and catalogue credit sectors) as well


-----

as focusing attention on broader thematic issues (including, for example, credit broking, credit cards, debt
management, affordability and creditworthiness, staff remuneration and incentives and vulnerability).

**_FCA Authorization and New Rules Applicable_**

From April 1, 2014, businesses that perform debt collection (including servicing companies which collect
debt on behalf of third parties) are required to either be FCA authorized or exempt.

Within our UK Division, there are three operating companies which have permission under Part 4A of
FSMA. to carry on regulated activities as follows:

(a) Lowell Portfolio I Ltd (firm reference number 730071) is solely a purchaser of consumer debt
and undertakes no debt collection activities—it has FCA authorization for:

        - exercising or having the right to exercise the lender’s rights and duties in relation to highcost short-term credit;

        - exercising or having the right to exercise the lender’s rights and duties under a regulated
home credit loan agreement; and

        - exercising/having the right to exercise the lender’s rights and duties under a regulated
credit agreement (excluding high-cost short-term credit, bill of sale agreements, and home
collected credit agreement);

(b) Lowell Financial Ltd (firm reference number 730175) undertakes debt collection work solely
for Lowell Portfolio I Ltd in respect of its purchased debts—it has FCA authorization to carry
on debt administration and debt-collecting; and

(c) Fredrickson International Limited (firm reference number 730425) undertakes debt collection
work as the authorized agent for various third parties—it has FCA authorization to carry on debt
administration and debt-collecting.

As part of its supervisory role in the consumer credit industry, the FCA classifies consumer credit firms
into lower and higher risk categories, depending on the types of activities provided. Further firm-specific subclassification by the FCA will determine the level of supervisory scrutiny to which individual consumer credit
firms are subject. At the time of FCA authorization in 2017, our UK regulated entities were confirmed as being
“flexible portfolio” firms meaning that they are not allocated a named individual supervisor.

In high level terms, the key areas of FCA regulation that apply to us under the FCA regime include:

    - high level “Threshold Conditions” for authorization (including adequate resources and
“suitability” of firms and their affiliates from a fitness and propriety perspective);

    - high level “Principles for Businesses.” Of particular relevance is the obligation on a firm to “pay
due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.” This Principle is supported by
detailed FCA guidance on “Treating Customers Fairly” (“TCF”), which sets out the FCA’s
expectations in relation to a regulated business’ treatment of its customers;

    - systems and controls, including governance, record keeping, conflicts of interest management and
internal audit (some of which will apply as guidance rather than mandatory rules);

    - the approval of senior managers (that is, directors and other senior management/key staff
performing certain senior management functions requiring individual FCA approval and being
subject to the FCA Senior Manager and Individual Conduct Rules as set out in the COCON
chapter of the FCA Rules and enforcement powers);

    - controllers (major shareholders and others) to be FCA approved;

    - auditors;

    - consumer credit conduct of business and marketing, including debt collection;


-----

    - regulatory reporting;

    - complaints handling;

    - financial crime/AML; and

    - FCA enforcement powers.

The FCA has the power to take enforcement action against a firm and/or its Senior Managers for breach
of one or more of the Principles for Business or, in the case of Senior Managers, the Conduct Rules, which may
result in the imposition of substantial fines, public censure, compensation and/or redress payable to customers.
Breach of certain requirements under the FSMA also carries potential criminal liability. Customers can also bring
private claims for damages under FSMA for loss suffered as a result of a contravention by a FCA authorized
person of a rule made by the FCA.

Further, where a regulated credit agreement is entered into without the lender having FCA permission,
the agreement is likely to be unenforceable without an order from the FCA. Additionally, if an unauthorized credit
broker referred the borrower to an authorized lender, any resulting regulated credit agreement between the lender
and the borrower may be unenforceable. It is therefore prudent for lenders who originate business through brokers
to ensure that they are appropriately authorized.

**_Further ongoing statutory obligations_**

The OFT issued specific guidance called the Debt Collection Guidance (“DCG”) and the Irresponsible
Lending Guidance (“ILG”), which set out detailed standards that businesses that collect debt or carry out tracing
activities must meet. The DCG has been superseded by CONC which applies specifically to consumer credit firms
such as ourselves. CONC in effect is the relevant provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, the DCG, the ILG and
other OFT Guidance redrafted into formal FCA rules and guidance. CONC sets out a number of overarching
principles that businesses should adopt in any debt recovery activities:

1. treating customers fairly;

2. being transparent when dealing with customers;

3. exercising forbearance and due consideration—in particular towards customers experiencing
financial difficulty;

4. acting proportionately when seeking to recover debts;

5. establishing and implementing clear, effective and appropriate policies and procedures for
engaging with customers and other relevant parties, including credit worthiness assessments
and dealing with customers whose accounts fall into arrears; and

6. establishing and implementing clear, appropriate and effective policies and procedures for
identifying and dealing with customers who the firm understands or reasonably suspects to be
particularly vulnerable.

CONC also provides examples of the types of behavior that the FCA would regard as amounting to unfair
or improper practices and unacceptable behavior. Examples include:

    - issuing communications to customers that are unfair, inaccurate, unclear or misleading (whether
directly or through the way they appear or information which they may omit to mention);

    - falsely representing their authority or legal position (for example, falsely claiming to work on
instructions from the courts as bailiffs);

    - using physical or psychological harassment to collect debts (including contacting customers at
inappropriate times of the day or too often, failing to allow for alternative, affordable repayment
amounts when a reasonable proposal is made, or inappropriately threatening to disclose debt
details to third parties);


-----

    - using deceptive or unfair methods (for example, sending demands to a person without establishing
that he or she is the actual customer);

    - inappropriately or unfairly charging for debt recovery (for example, misleading customers into
believing they are liable for recovery charges, where the underlying credit agreement does not so
provide);

    - acting in a threatening or unclear way on debt collection visits (for example, visiting the customer
at times when it is understood that such debtor might be particularly vulnerable or entering a
customer’s property without consent or appropriate court order);

    - continuing to collect statute barred debt in an unfair way (for example, implying that such debt
may be recoverable through the courts); and

    - failing to have adequate procedures and processes to ensure that customer data is accurate such
that the correct customer is pursued for the correct amount of debt.

With specific regard to vulnerable customers, on July 31, 2020, the FCA issued updated draft guidance
as part on an ongoing consultation process, concluding on September 30, 2020, reinforcing the requirement to
treat vulnerable customers fairly, understand vulnerable customer needs and the impact of vulnerability on the
customer needs as well as to ensure staff and processes are adequate to deal with vulnerable customer needs. The
current guidance remains broad but is intended to form the basis of final guidance that will be issued either in
2020 or early 2021.

The FCA also expects regulated firms to take responsibility for third parties they use (for example, third
party debt collectors).

Generally the use of DCAs probably represents one of the more significant conduct risks faced by us,
particularly in the way this part of our business model tests our controls in relation to DCAs.

**_Consumer credit legislative and regulatory requirements_**

As noted above, many of the provisions of the pre-existing statutory regime under the CCA and related
secondary legislation, continue to apply to our business and our relationships with customers, notwithstanding the
transition from the OFT to the FCA and the various requirements introduced as a result. Although this summary
does not purport to provide a full description of all such current or future requirements, a key ongoing area of
responsibility for any properly regulated debt collection business arises under the CCA (and legislation made
under it), FCA rules and guidance, the UTCCRs (for any contract made before October 1, 2015) and the CRA (for
any contract made on or after October 1, 2015). This is also an area of the law in which further regulatory changes
are anticipated in the medium term. Both the CCA and the UTCCRs/CRA set out specific requirements for the
entry into and ongoing management of consumer credit arrangements. The legislation includes both prescriptive
and generic provisions on the terms of consumer credit agreements, the advertising of consumer credit services,
and what constitutes, and the consequences of, any unfair relationships and unfair terms. This legislation applies
both to our own activities and to those of any initial credit provider, including our vendors. The principal aim of
the legislation is consumer protection. These legal requirements oblige creditors to, among other things:

    - provide customers with prescribed forms of pre-contractual documentation;

    - provide customers with prescribed credit agreement documentation at the outset;

    - enable customers to obtain copies of credit agreement documentation;

    - provide customers with prescribed forms of post-contractual statements and notices at prescribed
times;

    - provide a fair relationship between themselves and the customers (an “unfair relationship” can be
the result of an act or omission at any time); and

    - ensure that their agreements do not contain unfair terms (and provides that any unfair terms are not
binding on the customer).


-----

In addition to the above, the creditor has a duty at the request of the debtor under regulated credit
agreements to provide a copy of the executed agreement (if any) and of any other document referred to in it, and
to provide specified information in a signed statement (sections 77, 78 and 79, CCA). If the creditor does not
provide the documents and information within 12 working days of receiving a request with the fee of £1, then
they are not entitled to enforce the agreement while the default continues. The creditor need not respond to a
request for the information described above where no sums are payable by the debtor or where the request is made
less than one month after a previous request (relating to the same agreement) was complied with.

Under the CCA, a customer may request a court to determine whether there has been an “unfair
relationship” between the customer and the lender (which can include assignees). There are extensive and onerous
requirements that apply when such a determination is made, and the burden of proof is on a lender to prove that
an unfair relationship does not exist.

The content of, and format for, regulated agreements, as well as provisions around pre- and postcontractual information, is heavily prescribed by the CCA (including secondary legislation made under it) and
FCA Rules, primarily within CONC.

A regulated credit agreement must be properly executed in accordance with section 61 of the CCA. This
includes ensuring that the agreement:

    - is in the prescribed form containing all the prescribed terms and conforming to regulations under
section 60(1) of the CCA;

    - is signed in the prescribed manner both by the debtor and by, or on behalf of, the creditor;

    - embodies all the terms of the agreement (other than implied terms);

    - is provided to the debtor in a legible format; and

    - where the regulated credit agreement is to be secured on land, additional formality requirements
apply.

Section 65 of the CCA provides that improperly executed agreements (in real terms, agreements which
do not fully comply with all of the regulatory requirements including the signature of the borrower) are not capable
of being enforced against the borrower without an order of the court directing that such an agreement be
enforceable. This will also apply to enforcement by assignees.

Since April 6, 2007, the court has had discretion in all cases to enforce regulated agreements, whether or
not they comply in all respects with the requirements of the CCA, provided that the appropriate arrears notice(s)
and statements have been given (where appropriate). In the case of any agreement entered into on or after April
6, 2007, and agreements from before that date which are not irredeemably unenforceable, the court will be obliged
to make an enforcement order even where an agreement is regarded as improperly executed, unless it considers it
just to dismiss the application having regard to both prejudice caused to any person as a result of the breach and
the degree of culpability for it.

The court has other powers to address the defect by other means under the CCA, such as reducing or
discharging a sum payable to compensate for the prejudice suffered.

While the discretion given to the courts does not rule out regulated agreements being treated as
unenforceable because of technical breaches, on balance it is likely that the more technical the alleged breach is,
the more likely a court will be to consider it just to grant the enforcement order.

**_Unfair Contract Terms_**

The UTCCRs apply to agreements which have not been individually negotiated, which are entered into
with a consumer on or after July 1, 1995 and before October 1, 2015, and may affect our ability to seek
enforcement of certain terms of our customers’ original contracts, such as rights of the lender to vary the interest
rate and certain terms imposing early repayment charges and terms which give the lender a unilateral right to vary
the contract or interpret any term of the contract. In light of the broad and general wording of the UTCCRs which
makes any assessment of the fairness of terms largely subjective, it is difficult to predict whether or not a court
would find a term to be unfair. It is therefore possible that any credit agreement that has been made or may be


-----

made to customers covered by the UTCCRs may contain terms that are, if challenged, found to be unfair, which
may result in the terms not being binding on the customer.

The CRA received Royal Assent on March 26, 2015 and its main provisions came into force on October
1, 2015. The adoption of the CRA consolidates reform of consumer law in the United Kingdom including the
revocation of the UTCCRs for new consumer contracts made on or after October 1, 2015. The previous law under
the UTCCRs will continue to apply to older contracts. The CRA has a wider scope than the UTCCRs because it
applies to both negotiated and non-negotiated contracts. The key substantive provisions of the UTCCRs have,
however, been retained in the CRA, which merges the provisions of the UTCCRs with the provisions of the (wider
scope) Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 to consolidate and clarify the two regimes. The legislation includes
provisions to regulate the unfairness of terms that cause a significant imbalance between the parties, alongside the
concepts of a “blacklist” of unenforceable terms and non-exhaustive “grey” list of potentially unfair terms. The
CRA introduces new “grey” items and also extends the scope of the regulatory regime on unfair terms in part to
“consumer notices” provided by the service provider. Consumer notices include an announcement or other
communication which it is reasonable to assume is intended to be read by a consumer. The CRA gives consumer
law enforcers additional civil powers to seek to remedy breaches of consumer protection law. For example, new
redress measures will offer compensation to consumers who have suffered a loss as a result of the conduct in
question, and new compliance measures intend to prevent or reduce the risk of repeat conduct. In addition new
choice measures in the CRA enable consumers to choose more effectively between different suppliers.

In March 2015, the FCA removed certain guidance and other material on the UTCCR from its website
because they no longer reflect the FCA’s current view on unfair contract terms. The FCA has confirmed that it
does not intend to issue further guidance on unfair contract terms. In January 2016, the FCA website was updated
to refer to the Competition and Markets Authority’s (“CMA”) guidance consultation as the latest development in
guidance on unfair contract terms, and this guidance makes it clear that the CRA generally carries forward rather
than changes the substance of the protections provided to consumers under earlier legislation and guidance.

The FOS acts as an independent adjudicator of the consumer credit complaints made to it. Chargeable
claims attract a fee that is paid by the business, and a decision by the FOS is binding on the business, but not on
the consumer. Not all cases are determined to be “chargeable” however, the fee in respect of a chargeable case is
payable by the business, whether or not the business successfully defends such case. There are escalation
procedures for a consumer to make a complaint to the FOS. The FOS makes a decision on the basis of what is fair
and reasonable and good practice rather than, necessarily, on the basis of compliance with the law.

**_Data protection_**

As a debt purchase business with operations in the UK, DACH and Northern European regions, we must
comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Laws.

_Data Protection Law Requirements_

The Data Protection Laws impose stringent requirements regarding our processing of personal data as
well as our ability to hire service providers to assist with our processing of personal data. The basis of the GDPR,
which applies in all EU Member States, is that data subjects have a fundamental right to the protection of their
personal data. In order to protect this right, GDPR requires that organizations process personal data in a fair,
transparent and lawful manner. GDPR requires that we inform customers about how we collect, use and maintain
their personal data, the lawful basis we rely on to process it and who we share their personal data with according
to the purpose for which the data subject has provided or understood that their personal data would be used.

GDPR introduces certain direct obligations on data processors and requires that detailed contractual
obligations be implemented between all data controllers and processors. Thus, as a controller, we must have
detailed and specific instructions and agreements with our services providers (processors) about how they handle
personal data. Processors also have direct liability for processing personal data that they know or believe to be
contrary to the GDPR or for processing in contravention of the controller’s instructions. As a controller we are
fully liable for data processing done by our processors and both the controller and processor have heightened
record keeping and security requirements for documenting their processing and regulatory compliance. As a result,
our liability and expenses, including legal fees, insurance and IT have increased and will continue to do so.

In addition, GDPR requires us to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level
of security appropriate to the organization’s processing requirements and risk. Organizations must notify the
relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours and in some instances, provide notification to data subjects.


-----

GDPR provides data subjects with personal rights to have access to their personal data as well as to have their
personal data updated, have their personal data transmitted to another organization and in some instances stop
the organization from processing their personal data or require the deletion of their personal data. Another
important data subject right, relevant to our industry, is that data subjects have the right not to have decisions,
which have a legal or similarly significant effect for the data subject, made about them using automated decision
making and profiling without human intervention. These obligations also increase our customer services
requirements, oversight and expenses on an ongoing basis.

_Liability_

Liability under the Data Protection Laws has increased under GDPR, and supervisory authorities in each
EU member state and the UK have wide discretion in imposing fines, with the ability to fine up to the greater of
€20 million or 4% of global annual turnover. After the Transition Period organizations will face the potential for
double regulatory fines in both the UK and EU. GDPR also provides a private right of action for material or nonmaterial damage and the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered
as a result of an infringement. Finally, the risk to our reputation from adverse publicity resulting from regulatory
intervention, both from an industry as well as consumer standpoint, increases our overall risk profile.

In addition, legal uncertainties about the legality of cookies and other tracking technologies may increase
regulatory scrutiny, and increase potential civil liability under data protection or consumer protection laws.
Several countries in the EU have recently issued guidance on the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies
which require an additional layer of consent from website users for third party advertising, social media
advertising and analytics. Consent to place cookies on a user’s device now requires explicit consent to each type
of cookie and transparency notices outlining the processing of cookie data. Though there are broad similarities in
the approach, there are also jurisdictional differences in relation to EU-UK cooperation with regard to views on
advertising and marketing, making it more difficult to employ a common set policies and marketing strategies for
companies that market products throughout Europe. Germany and the UK are both at the forefront of regulation
in the area of cookies, advertising and consent and regulatory activism is on the rise in these and other EU member
states with regard to new rules on disclosure and consent has led to increased investigation activity and fines.

Finally, in addition to these regulatory risks, infringement of these laws can lead to reputational risk and
significantly undermine customers’ trust in our business. We further note that the UK FCA is particularly focused
on operational resilience and has taken action against regulated firms which have suffered incidents leading to the
loss, disclosure or mishandling of customer data.

_Marketing and Advertising Issues_

The ePrivacy Directive regulations govern privacy in electronic communications including direct
marketing via email, SMS/text and phone as well as cookies. The current EU Member States’ local guidance in
line with GDPR has significantly increased the risk of penalties for breach of the GDPR and law implementing
the ePrivacy Directive. Increased regulation of privacy and data protection may lead to broader restrictions about
the way we market our products on a global basis, increase our risk of regulatory oversight and affect our ability
to reach our consumers and our capability to provide our consumers with personalized services and experiences.

The European Union’s institutions are now debating the ePrivacy Regulation, which would repeal and
replace the current ePrivacy Directive that regulates electronic marketing and use of cookies and tracking
technologies. The new guidance and the ePrivacy Regulation would together require extensive disclosure and
consent, regulate web beacons and similar technology affecting our ability to use a user’s location and other data
for personalized advertising and alter the ability of retail advertisers to place ads across social media and the web.

_Brexit_

Following the end of the Transition Period, we will continue to have to comply with both the GDPR and
the UK Data Protection Act 2018. The relationship between the UK and the EU including the cooperation and
application of decisions made by the European Commission and the European Court of Justice (CJEU) remains
to be seen. In addition, the UK is now in an indefinite holding period with regard to its ability to be recognized by
the EU as having “adequacy” for cross border transactions. The UK will be a “third country” vis a vis the EEA
member states requiring cross border transfer mechanisms that UK businesses were not previously required to
employ, which may cause additional legal expense and delays in sending personal data to and from the EU.


-----

**_Lending Code standards_**

We also operate in accordance with the provisions of the Standards of Lending Practice—previously the
Lending Code (a voluntary, but widely adhered to, standard of practice largely applicable to banks and building
societies in the UK) that are relevant to lending and debt collection activities. While we are not a subscriber to the
Standards of Lending Practice, a number of our clients are banks, and as such they have to ensure that third parties
they use offer standards that meet the requirements of the Standards of Lending Practice.

**_Other regulatory bodies_**

We are also regulated by a number of other government bodies, including the Office of Communications
Services (“OFCOM”), the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications
industries. All telephone calls made to and received from customers are recorded, and OFCOM monitors, for
example, the number of abandoned calls made by businesses to ensure that any business does not have 3% or
more in any one campaign. We use automated dialing equipment and other communications tools in our business,
and our telephony activities are compliant with OFCOM’s regulations.

Since October 1, 2015 we are also regulated by the SRA by virtue of a legal services license which we
use within the Group to carry our debt recovery litigation.

On July 15, 2020, HM Treasury published The Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and
Mental Health Crisis Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020 . These Regulations will come into
force on May 4, 2021 and would give eligible people who receive professional debt advice access to a 60-day
period in which interest, fees and charges are frozen and enforcement action is paused. For people receiving
mental health crisis treatment, the moratorium may be accessed for the duration of such treatment.

**_Our compliance and quality control_**

Debt vendors regard strict compliance with laws and regulations as essential for debt buyers to succeed
in an increasingly regulated market, and in accordance with market practice, debt sale agreements usually contain
warranties given by the debt purchaser that it shall comply with such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with
laws and regulations or revocation of a permission, licenses, authorizations or other actions by us that may damage
the reputation of a vendor, may entitle a vendor to terminate the debt purchase agreement or entitle it to repurchase
portfolios we previously acquired from it. Our management team considers quality control and compliance to be
of the utmost importance, and we believe our compliance and quality control record is a competitive advantage.
We are proactively involved in the Credit Services Association (“CSA”). Our Non-Executive Director, UK
Division served as the President of the CSA for two and a half years both before and after joining the Group,
during which time she led the working party which re drafted the CSA Code of Practice. She is now the CSA
Director with responsibility for the compliance portfolio.

The laws and regulations under which we operate have at their core the fair treatment of all consumers,
which we have sought to embed within our day to day processes. We seek to provide realistic repayment options
for all consumers and in particular those in financial difficulty. By offering consumers flexible and sustainable
payment plans tailor made to their individual needs, we help consumers pay down their debt and improve their
credit histories on a consensual basis. As a general policy, we have historically not added any charges or fees to
the debt we collect. We have dedicated policies and processes to deal with consumers, which are periodically
reviewed and enhanced where necessary, and we liaise with external bodies such as the CSA to promote best
practice. Also, in her role with the CSA, our Non-Executive Director, UK Division has regular meetings with the
FCA to discuss industry topics.

We have a clear governance structure and experienced senior management talent across all parts of our
organization so that all key components of the business receive appropriate focus. The executive team has
established a compliance framework, operational procedures and governance structures, supported by a number
of proprietary systems, to enable us to conduct business in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and
guidance. Our Chief Risk Officer has ultimate responsibility for regulatory compliance, with each member of the
executive team responsible for compliance within their particular organizational function. The executive team is
supported by a 90 person risk, compliance, governance, quality control and audit team with extensive experience
in the financial services industry, managed by individuals who have mainly worked in compliance roles within
FCA regulated companies or legal firms. The compliance team’s responsibilities include setting compliance
policy, maintaining proactive regulator relationships, managing and responding to complaints, oversight and


-----

quality assurance, responding to client audits, setting up training programs, management reporting, risk
management framework and internal audit.

Further, we have invested heavily in training our employees to be fully aware of our regulatory
requirements and our policies. We have an internal policy regarding the handling (and identifying) of consumers
who are considered vulnerable and disadvantaged (e.g., consumers who are 70 years of age or older, physically
or mentally ill, or serving in the armed forces), which is based on what we believe is the right and proper way of
treating such consumers. In addition, the purpose of this internal policy is to ensure that the need to protect
vulnerable customers and treat them fairly is strongly embedded in our culture. Depending on individual case
assessment, the debt may be written off or reduced, payment terms may be reset, or a payment holiday may be
granted. We have a comprehensive operational quality assurance function in place that includes regular quality
monitoring checks, data checks, performance reviews and other operational reviews to ensure that collectors are
operating within our guidelines.

**_Industry engagement_**

We are actively engaged in setting compliance policies within the industry. We have established
relationships with governmental bodies, including the FCA (many of the individuals previously employed by the
OFT have transferred to the FCA) the ICO and the FOS, as well as trade organizations relevant to our industry,
such as the CSA, the Finance and Leasing Association (“FLA”), the County Court Association (“CCUA”) and
the Consumer Credit Trade Association (“CCTA”), so that we may make use of best practices.

We have promoted a collaborative approach to regulation within the debt purchase industry. Industry
groups such as the CSA which as the United Kingdom’s only national association for companies providing debt
collection services, acts as a trade body promoting professional industry standards, publish codes of conduct and
receive complaints regarding improper behavior. While we are in direct contact with regulators because of our
scale and market leadership position, we also take an active part in the trade associations that represent the
industry’s interests.

Through our participation in these organizations, we actively promote best practices by contributing
resources when needed to debate or campaign for wider industry initiatives and by leading by example within the
membership base. We are a full member of the CSA, and therefore must abide by its code of practice.

We have established a ‘primary authority’ relationship with our local trading standards office. Under this
primary authority, we meet with representatives of the office typically on a monthly basis to discuss any trends in
queries or complaints and seek guidance for any new projects and processes that affect consumers. Further, if any
queries or complaints are made to any other trading standards office, they will be referred to our local office,
facilitating a productive and accurate response. The primary authority arrangement increases transparency and
enables our local trading standards office to have a better understanding of our business and practices.

**_Compliance track record_**

We have a record of low complaints with regulators. No regulatory body has ever imposed sanctions on
us for the unfair treatment of our consumers.

Through our carefully designed collection processes and communications strategies, including letters
and telephone calls, we seek to ensure that the number of complaints is as low as possible. Our success in this
area is evidenced by the fact that the number of complaints as a percentage of live accounts owned was
approximately 0.4% in the twelve month period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.

Where a financial services consumer is dissatisfied with our response to a complaint, they are informed
that they can refer the matter to FOS. After investigation, FOS will decide whether or not to treat the matter as a
formal case. In the same period (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019), there were a total of 94 FOS cases in
respect of our UK Division consumers and FOS made decisions on 109 cases, 23% of which were decided in
favor of our consumers. This compares favorably with our direct peer group where the average upheld rate is
approximately 26%.

The FCA can take into account the number of complaints received about a business to decide if that firm
is complying with the relevant regulatory framework and remains fit to continue to be authorized by the FCA.
They can take regulatory action against a regulated firm and insist that a business change its practices. If any
complaint is found in favor of a consumer by the FOS, we are required to pay the consumer whatever sum the


-----

FOS determines is appropriate, but no fine or other penalty can be imposed by the FOS, although cases that reveal
systemic problems with a business could be investigated by the FCA.

**_Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing_**

Certain companies in our UK Division must comply with applicable rules and regulations concerning
anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. We have implemented a procedure in relation to anti-money
laundering and terrorist financing throughout the UK Division.

**Key Regulations Affecting our DACH Division**

Debt collection services are to a limited extent subject to regulatory supervision in Germany. The legal
framework governing debt collection services in Germany comprises, among others, the German Banking Act
(Kreditwesengesetz—KWG), the German Legal Services Act (Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz), the Introductory Act
to the German Legal Services Act (Einführungsgesetz zum Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz—RDGEG) and the
Implementing Regulations to the German Legal Services Act (Rechtsdienstleistungsverordnung—RDV) (together,
the “German Legal Services Regime”). Our operations, including debt collection, debt purchase, the lawyer
outsourcing process and our operations related to payment streams, are subject to these laws and regulations. See
“Risk Factors.”

**_Regulation pursuant to the German Banking Act_**

Pursuant to the German Banking Act, factoring, i.e., the ongoing purchase of receivables in a commercial
manner or on a scale that requires professionally organized business operations and on the basis of framework
agreements, qualifies as the provision of financial services which requires a license by the German Federal
Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, “BaFin”). BaFin has,
however, taken the view that the ongoing purchase of receivables only qualifies as financial services if such
purchase serves financing purposes, which according to BaFin is not the case if the purchased receivables are
already due and payable. In line with the interpretation by BaFin of the relevant provision of the German Banking
Act, the purchase of receivables which are due and payable does not qualify as the provision of financial services
under the German Banking Act and does not constitute factoring. As a result, BaFin has confirmed in writing that
the debt collection business of the relevant subsidiaries of Lowell Holdco GmbH does not qualify as factoring
within the meaning of the German Banking Act and consequently no license under the German Banking Act is
required.

**_Regulation pursuant to the German Payment Services Supervisory Act_**

Pursuant to the German Payment Services Supervisory Act (Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz), the
provision and receipt of payments in the context of debt collection services may, under certain circumstances,
amount to the provision of payment services, including in particular to the provision of financial transfer business
(Finanztranfergeschäft), which would require a license pursuant to the German Payment Services Supervision
Act. However, in line with BaFin’s current administrative practice, debt collection does not amount to financial
transfer business where the provision of debt collection services is limited to defaulted debt that has been
outstanding for a certain period of time.

**_Regulation under the German Legal Services Regime_**

In Germany, debt collection for third parties qualifies as the provision of legal services which in general
requires a registration under the German Legal Services Act (Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz). Any debt collection
agency applying for registration under the German Legal Services Act needs to demonstrate, in particular, personal
aptitude and reliability, theoretical and practical expertise in the area of the legal services to be provided and
professional liability insurance coverage and is subject to supervision by the competent courts.

Legal entities are required to appoint at least one qualified employee, director or officer who commands
the required aptitude, reliability and expertise. Such qualified person must be permanently employed at the
respective debt collection company, must be authorized to issue instructions, but must not be subject to any
instructions, with regard to all legal services provided by the respective agency and must be authorized to represent
the debt collection company _vis-à-vis third parties. The following subsidiaries of Lowell Holdco GmbH are_
registered for the provision of debt collection services under the German Legal Services Act: SIR, GPP, PCS,
IBW, ZYK, GCG, Tesch Inkasso Forderungsmanagement GmbH, Tesch Inkasso Finance GmbH, Tesch
mediafinanz GmbH and Apontas GmbH & Co. KG


-----

In addition to these registration requirements, the German Legal Services Act regulates the manner of
the provision of debt collection services, in particular, with regard to information requirements and, indirectly, the
remuneration of debt collection agencies, which is generally recognized to be part of a creditor’s default damage
(Verzugsschaden). As part of the creditor’s default damage, servicer fees of a debt collection company can be
charged to the debtor up to the amount of fees a lawyer could charge pursuant to the German Lawyer
Remuneration Act (Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetz). Similarly, costs in connection with the subsequent retention
of external lawyers are frequently passed on to the debtor. Since November 2014, debt collection agencies have
been subjected to increased notification and information obligations with respect to their dealings with debtors
under the German Legal Services Act (Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz).

**_Data Protection in Germany and Austria_**

Several companies in our DACH Division process personal data in their businesses, both when providing
third-party debt collection and debt purchase services. We handle and process large amounts of consumer personal
data, such as names, account numbers, contact information and other account specific data. Our ability to obtain,
retain, share and otherwise process this personal data is governed by the GDPR, which went into effect in May
2018. The GDPR is supplemented by local data protection laws in the EU member states, in Germany by the
Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018) and in Austria by the Data Protection Act
(Datenschutzgesetz), both of which went into effect in May 2018.

The GDPR is a uniform framework laying down principles for legitimate data processing in the European
Union and the European Economic Area. Compared to the predecessor Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), the
GDPR contains significantly stricter requirements for data protection, in particular for data mapping, transparency,
data subject rights, processor (service provider) obligations, the requirement to designate a data protection officer
and the obligations to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, including submitting data breach notifications
(within a strict deadline) to the relevant supervisory authority and data subjects. We are also subject to the
supervision of local data protection authorities (“DPA”) in Germany and Austria. The GDPR provides for
significantly increased sanctions and penalties. DPAs can, _inter alia, impose monetary penalties of up to €20_
million or 4% of global annual group turnover, whichever is the greater, on organizations for serious breaches of
GDPR and, under certain circumstances, criminal fines and penalties.

Under the GDPR, personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes,
and may only be processed in a manner consistent with these purposes. Personal data must be adequate, relevant
and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and/or processed, and it must
not be kept in a form that permits identification of consumers for longer than is necessary for those purposes. The
GDPR also strengthens individuals’ rights and imposes stricter requirements on companies processing personal
data. For example, GDPR has led to an increase in requests from data subjects based on their enhanced rights such
as the right to access their personal data, the right of deletion and the right to restrict the processing of their
personal data.

We have implemented an internal data protection organization, including the appointment of data
protection officers for our companies in the DACH Division, and we have established data protection processes
and policies. Overall, we have a robust data protection framework that is based on the GDPR and applicable local
data protection laws. However, the task of meeting all the Data Protection Laws requirements is complex, in
particular taking into account that there are still material legal uncertainties in various respects and that data
protection authorities continuously publish more detailed GDPR guidance. Our GDPR program identified risks
and associated mitigation plans and we adopted a risk based approach to their prioritization. A privacy operating
model has been defined with clear roles and responsibilities and is in the process of being embedded in all regions,
including the DACH Division. Further automation and system change is planned via other strategic programs,
which will continue to mature our capability and privacy management framework to strengthen compliance with
Data Protection Laws, including the GDPR.

The ‘Data Protection by Design and by Default’ concept under the GDPR has required a reappraisal of
our IT and Business Change and Procurement approaches to integrate data protection into our processes, practices
and systems from the design stage right through the lifecycle. This includes carrying out data protection impact
assessments, ensuring that data minimization is embedded across the business so that only the appropriate amount
of data required for any particular purpose is processed, deleting unnecessary data and anonymizing data wherever
possible.

Specific provisions in the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018) regulate the
legitimacy of credit reporting and scoring as well as transparency requirements for such types of data processing.


-----

It may only be used if data protection rules are met, if relevant data are used and if the score is based on
acknowledged, reliable mathematical-statistical methods. If address data are used the law requires a prior notice
to the data subject. The use of a probability value calculated by credit reporting agencies to determine a natural
person’s ability and willingness to pay is subject to further requirements stipulated in the Federal Data Protection
Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018).

Personal data relating to collected or purchased debt is partly governed by sector specific data protection
regulations or secrecy obligations. Our business is dependent on the ability of third parties to provide us with
personal data relating to collected or purchased debt, including personal data provided by the original creditors,
credit information bureaus as well as publicly available personal data.

**_Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing_**

Certain companies in our DACH Division must comply with applicable rules and regulations concerning
anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. We have implemented a procedure in relation to anti-money
laundering and terrorist financing throughout the DACH Division.

**_International Conventions_**

In our international debt collection operations we are subject to European Union legislation and
international conventions, such as the European Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of December, 12, 2012 on
jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (“Brussels Ia”),
which applied from January 10, 2015 and superseded the European Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of
December 22, 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
matters (“Brussels I”), and the Conventions on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters as of October 30, 2007 (“Lugano II”). Brussels Ia and Lugano II both address issues
on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The contents are
mainly the same, but whereas Brussels Ia applies between the member states of the European Union, Lugano II
applies between Iceland, Norway and Switzerland and the member states of the European Union in relation to
these three states.

Under both Brussels Ia and Lugano II, judgments are, as a general rule, recognized without any special
proceedings between the relevant states. Further, Brussels Ia and Lugano II allow judgments given and
enforceable in one relevant state to be enforced in another relevant state following only an application to that
effect.

**Key Regulations Affecting the Northern European Division**

**_Fair Debt Collection Practices_**

As debt collection regulation is not based on specific EU legislation, it is not possible to make use of a
passporting or similar regime. Instead, each country has developed its own set of rules for debt collection
operations. The regulations cover, among other things: the methods by which claims can be assigned or
transferred; the ways in which a customer can be contacted and a debt collected; and the types and level of fees,
interests and costs that can be imposed, and whether those fees, interests and costs can be passed to the customer
or the client.

In countries where there are no specific regulations covering debt collection and where no licensing
requirements apply for certain debt collection operations, there are still regulations of a more general nature which
we must observe when carrying out our debt collection operations. Such regulations include, for example, general
civil and commercial rules and consumer protection laws and regulations regarding caps on collection fees and
interest costs. In addition, in a number of markets in which we operate, the reimbursement of costs for debt
collection is limited by law. Any regulatory changes reducing the amount of such costs we can recover may have
a negative impact on our results of operations.

In many of the countries in which our operations are licensed or regulated, our subsidiaries are subject
to certain integrity tests with respect to debt collection. These integrity tests may include verifying that: the
collection business is carried out in accordance with local rules and regulations; consumer lending operations are
conducted in accordance with sound lending practices; the directors of the board have sufficient knowledge and
experience and have not misused any debt collection permissions; and the directors meet other general suitability
and reliability checks.


-----

**_Statutes of Limitations_**

Rules regarding the length of time after which an unpaid debt may not be pursued by creditors and the
ways in which the statute of limitations can be tolled so that a debt can remain collectible also vary across
jurisdictions. In a majority of the countries in which we operate, it is possible to extend the statutes of limitation
on historic debt claims indefinitely by using various methods, including enforcement actions, notification of the
customer or otherwise interrupting the limitation period with continued court proceedings. Some of the countries
in which we operate have in recent years changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting
the ability to extend or interrupt the limitation period, or have discussed doing so. We constantly monitor any
changes in these rules in the countries in which we operate, and, where appropriate, implement local procedures
to interrupt the limitations period. Any significant reduction in the statute of limitations or in the ability to toll the
statute of limitations, and any failure to implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations periods, would
negatively impact our operations.

**_Enhanced Consumer Protection_**

There has been a trend in recent years to afford more protection to consumers. Various laws, regulations
and judicial decisions in jurisdictions in which we operate have changed the way we operate and some have
negatively impacted our financial condition.

Consumer protection laws can limit our ability to enforce debt claims. For example, in Finland, the
enforcement of a consumer debt claim in the event of a default by the customer is subject to restrictions, such as
a minimum period of time having passed since the payment due date and a minimum proportion of the debt
remaining outstanding. Further, enforcement is prohibited if the payment default of the consumer customer is due
to social force majeure, such as illness or unemployment, or other circumstance beyond the customer’s control,
unless it would be perceptibly unreasonable to the creditor in the circumstances. Similar laws exist in other
jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, in Denmark, debt collection must be carried out in accordance
with good practice (God inkassoskik), which limits the measures that a creditor or its servicer may take to collect
debt. In addition, a claim against a debtor may only be enforced before the courts if the creditor has forwarded a
written demand and at least 10 days have passed. A debtor’s assets may be protected against execution by the
Bailiff’s Court, based on the rule of principle that a debtor must be able to uphold a respectable/minimum standard
of living (trangsbeneficiet), regardless of the circumstances that gave rise to the claim. In Norway, debt collection
must be carried out in accordance with good practice (God inkassoskikk). Before court collection proceedings can
be initiated, the debtor must have received a pre-warning, either as part of a written demand for payment or as a
separate notice specifying an additional deadline for payment of no less than 14 days from submission. Court
collection proceedings cannot be initiated before the relevant deadline for payment has expired and the debt
collection agency has considered whether the claim is justified.

Certain countries in which we have operations have taken steps to facilitate debt restructuring by
individuals, whereby a payment plan for all outstanding indebtedness is initiated. After making all payments
pursuant the payment plan, the customer is no longer liable to pay any of the debt included in the debt
reconstruction. In Sweden, a new Debt Reconstruction Act (Sw. Skuldsaneringslag 2016:675) came into effect
on November 1, 2016, under which eligible customers may, under certain circumstances, be allowed a payment
plan shorter than the normal five years. In Norway, a debt reconstruction may involve either a delay in payment
of all or part of a debt; the creditors waiving, in whole or in part, their claims on interest or fees; and/or the
customer no longer being liable to pay the debt after a particular period of time. In Denmark, the Bankruptcy
Court may, by petition from the debtor, grant an eligible debtor partial debt relief and/or reconstruction of debt.
The Bankruptcy Court determines eligibility on a case-by-case basis. In Finland, the district court approves the
payment plan, the duration of which is set up in the Act on the Adjustment of the Debts of a Private Individual
(57/1993, as amended, Laki yksityishenkilön velkajärjestelystä).

Customers may also become subject to insolvency proceedings which may result in a delay or prevention
in the enforcement of the claims transferred to us, including reductions in principal or interest. Collection of
unsecured claims in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency is generally limited by means of the funds available
for distribution from the insolvent estate.

**_Consumer Credit Development_**

Consumer credit operations have received increased regulatory attention in many of the jurisdictions in
which we operate. Some countries have imposed caps on interest rates or total cost of credit and further regulated
consumer loans with small principal values. Other countries have targeted particular types of consumer credit


-----

agreements. For example, in Danish consumer credit agreements with respect to short term loans (i.e., loans with
a repayment falling within three months from the granting of the loan), there is the mandatory two day waiting
period from the offer of a loan to its acceptance by the consumer.

Another pronounced effect of this enhanced focus on consumer credit has been to increase the scope of
which entities must hold a consumer credit license. In reaction to a recent European Court of Justice case, Verein
_für Konsumenteninformation v INKO, Inkasso GmbH, that held debt collection companies were credit_
intermediaries and thus not required to provide pre-contractual information to consumers, many countries took
legislative action to impose a requirement on debt collection companies to register with the local authority or
obtain a consumer credit license. Stricter regulations in general may increase the compliance burden and operating
costs.

**_Data Protection_**

We process personal data in our business, both when providing debt collection services and undertaking
debt purchasing. The GDPR has been incorporated into Norwegian law. Although based on a regulation and
directly applicable in all member states, the GDPR contains several opening clauses, where by member states may
enact specific national rules in specified areas. This entails that slightly different data protection requirements may
apply to each of our subsidiaries within the EU. The requirements include that personal data may only be collected
for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and may only be processed in a manner consistent with these
purposes. Further, personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the
purposes for which it is collected and/or processed and it must not be kept for a longer period of time than
necessary for the purposes of the collection. In several jurisdictions, however, the local anti-money laundering
legislation requires that the financial undertakings store data obtained in relation to customer due diligence for
five years after the closure of a customer relationship or five years after a transaction has been executed, regardless
of whether the storage is considered necessary.

We are also subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in each country where we
operate. To comply with regulatory requirements, we have established data protection processes, including having
in place data protection policies, information security policies, data retention policies and procedures for handling
data subject requests. Furthermore, certain jurisdictions in which we operate require that we acquire a license
from, or register with, the local data protection authority. All of our entities will be included in our company-wide
GDPR program, to ensure the data protection policies across all of our entities are harmonious.

The GDPR has significantly changed the EU data protection landscape, including strengthening of
individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with
administrative fines up to €20 million or 4% of global annual group turnover, whichever is higher. GDPR also
offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the
potential damages. We have implemented the GDPR requirements and to enhance awareness, governance and
controls of data protection procedures throughout our operations. This will ensure that our data protection policies
are effective and applied consistently going forward.

**_Anti-Money Laundering_**

As part of certain operations, especially debt purchasing and financing operations, we follow anti-money
laundering and countering terrorist financing standards set forth in the applicable local laws implementing
Directive (EU) 2005/60/EC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money
laundering and terrorist financing. Our operations are also subject to requirements of local anti-money laundering
laws.

On May 20, 2015, Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the
purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, and repealing
Directive 2005/60/EC (the “4th AML Directive”) was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. The
4th AML Directive enhances the current client due diligence requirements and also imposes stricter sanctions
with administrative fines of at least €5,000,000 or 10% of total annual turnover. The 4th AML directive directs
all EU member states to transpose the directive into local law by June 2017. The 4th AML Directive was included
in the EEA agreement in December 2018 and implemented in Norwegian law as of 15 October 2018. To ensure
compliance with the 4th AML directive, we have established a specifically-designed initiative, the AML Project,
and appointed a group AML officer to monitor transposition of the 4th AML Directive, coordinate implementation
of required solutions for new client due diligence measures and ensure ongoing monitoring of clients and their
transactions. We are also in the process of enhancing the client screening against sanctions lists by implementing


-----

advanced IT solutions as part of the AML Project objectives. Directive (EU) 2018/843 (the “5[th] AML Directive”)
was approved in the EFA Committee 30 April 2020 and is likely to be implemented in Norway in 2020.

**_Securitisation_**

Following the entry into force of the Norwegian Financial Undertakings Act in 2016, the previous
provisions that accommodated securitization for Norwegian financial undertakings were abolished.

**Regulatory Licenses**

**_Debt Collection_**

In several of the countries where we operate and provide debt collection services, as well as in Denmark
and Norway, debt collection is a regulated area and companies providing such services are subject to licensing or
registration requirements. In these countries, the entity offering debt collection services has a license issued by,
or is otherwise registered with, the relevant local authority. Although the relevant local authority varies by
jurisdiction, normally it is the national financial supervisory authority, police commissioner (Rigspolitichefen),
data inspection authority, regional state administrative agency or, in some cases, the national association for debt
collection companies.

**_Purchased Debt_**

Our debt purchasing operations in certain subsidiaries subjects us to various licensing, registration and
permit regimes. Many jurisdictions deem debt purchasing as a financial undertaking or as providing credit
services, and thus require debt purchasing companies to obtain approval from a local authority in order to operate
their businesses. As these regulations are not based on EU legislation, each country has developed its own
requirements relating to the investment in debt portfolios. In some cases, our entity is licensed as a financial
undertaking by the local financial supervisory authority for purchasing debt portfolios from financial institutions
and is required to hold a type of bank or credit license for its debt purchasing operations. In some jurisdictions,
purchasing performing mortgages portfolios could trigger certain requirements, such as having to obtain a credit
license, comply with AML measures or maintain a certain level of civil liability insurance.

Many countries specifically regulate the assignment of debt claims to other parties. For example, in
Norway, such contracts can only be assigned without consent of the debtor to other financial institutions, nondefaulted loans can (with certain exemptions) only be acquired by financial institutions and the transfer of a loan
portfolio of significance for any of the involved entities requires regulatory consent. Additionally, some
jurisdictions make it more difficult for factoring contracts to be assigned. In most of the jurisdictions in which we
operate, the court will refer to the contract in determining whether an assignment is allowed, but in some the
courts will weigh special considerations favoring consumers in deciding whether to allow an assignment.

**_Norwegian debt collection law_**

In Norway, there are two debt collection models: the servicing model (fremmedinkasso) and the purchase
of claims model (oppkjøpsinkasso). Both models falls within the definition of debt collection services
(inkassovirksomhet) as defined the Norwegian Debt Collection Act of 1988 (the “DCA”).

In relation to the purchase of claims model, Section 45 of the Financial Contracts Act of 1999 sets out
that transfer of claims originated by a financial institution, municipality or county council requires the debtors’
express consent unless the purchaser is licensed as a bank, credit institution, financing company or similar. Hence,
in order for such claims to be transferred without customer consent, the debt collection agency needs to be licensed
as such financing undertaking.

The debt collection agency must fulfil applicable requirements set out in Section 4 of the DCA. Among
other things, the agency must be registered in the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises, hold a debt
collection license (unless licensed as a lawyer or financial institution) and maintain a guarantee(by way of
depositing a security statement from an insurance company with the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway
(the “NFSA”)) and the manager must have a personal debt collection license. The NFSA will assess whether
members of the board of directors, managing director, major owners and manager with the debt collection license
are suitable and of good repute.

Debt collection agencies being licensed as financing companies must comply with requirements similar
to those which apply to banks and credit institutions.


-----

The DCA and the Debt Collection Regulation of 1989 sets out detailed regulations as to when written
payment reminders, notices of debt collection and demands for payment may be sent to debtors and the maximum
fees that may be charged. As a general rule, the debtor is required to compensate the creditor’s necessary collection
costs, including those costs that are incurred by engaging a debt collection agency. If the debt collection agency
charges the creditor costs within certain defined maximum amounts, the creditor can claim compensation for those
costs from the debtor. If the creditor has incurred out of court debt recovery costs that exceed those maximum
amounts, the creditor may only in certain cases demand reimbursement of the actual costs.

The debt collection agency must act in accordance with good debt collection practice and observe
applicable requirements on handling of debtors and customers. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway
has provided further guidance in circulars and precedent cases. Complaints against debt collection agencies and
other disputes with debtors can be brought before the Finance Complaints Board (Finansklagenemnda).

For example, in October 2018 the Norwegian Ministry of Justice appointed a committee to review the
DCA, including fee structures set forth therein. The DCA Committee is composed of representatives from the
Norwegian Ministry of Justice, financial supervisory authorities, the consumer protection council, the banking
and finance industry and from the debt collection industry. The DCA Committee presented their report on January
27, 2020 for consideration by the Norwegian Ministry of Justice. The DCA Committee’s proposal would reduce
the amount of collection fees that may be charged on a sliding scale depending on the size of the overall claim,
with the most significant reduction for smaller claims. The proposal has not yet been enacted.

Although the DCA Committee’s review remains ongoing, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated
changes to fee regulations. In response to the pandemic, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice issued an extraordinary
public consultation, and on June 19, 2020 approved a measure to reduce collection fees by up to 50% on claims
falling due after October 1, 2020 for claims maturing thereafter. The June 2020 fee reductions are more targeted
towards larger claims than the reductions set forth in the DCA Committee’s proposal and are expected to remain
in effect until the legislative process is complete. Other elements of the review will continue to be considered as
part of the legislative process. Although the June 2020 fee reductions will have less of an effect on our business
than the reductions proposed by the DCA Committee, as they are targeted at larger claims, we believe that the
June 2020 fee reductions will negatively impact the collections, results of operations and profitability of our
Norwegian operations.

In addition, on May 11, 2020, a new Temporary Act on Reorganization to Mitigate Economic Hardship
Resulting from COVID-19 came into force, supplementing the 1992 Act on voluntary and mandatory debt
settlement for private persons. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees
_and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Norway—Insolvency.”_

**_Consumer Credit Operations_**

Our consumer credit operations in various jurisdictions are subject to specific licensing or registration
requirements by the respective regulatory bodies and supervision by consumer advocacy agencies. As a result of
these consumer credit licenses or registrations, certain rules regarding ownership, ownership management and
management assessment apply to us. These rules involve, among other things, that approval from the relevant
authorities must be obtained prior to a shareholder acquiring shares that would bring the shareholder’s direct or
indirect holding of any of our license-holding entities to, or in excess of, certain thresholds or the shareholder
otherwise obtaining a significant influence over the management of any of the license-holding entities. The entities
subject to consumer license requirements often must comply with other requirements, such as having dedicated
compliance and internal control resources or meeting capital adequacy requirements that are similar to those
applicable to banks.

-----

**Compensation and Share Ownership**

The aggregate compensation paid by the Group to key management personnel who are directors and/or
senior executives of subsidiaries of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2019 was £4.5 million. The
Directors of the Parent are not paid by any company that forms part of the Group. See Note 5d in the 2019 Group
Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have also established management equity participation plan. See “Certain Relationships and Related_Party Transactions—Management Equity Participation Program.”_

**Conflicts of interest**

We believe that there are currently no conflicts of interest between the duties owed by executive
management to us and their private interests. Certain of the Directors are representatives of Permira Funds, which
is our indirect majority shareholder. In certain situations, the interests of Permira Funds, as indirect majority
shareholder, may differ from the interests of our other shareholders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Structure and the Financing—The interests of our controlling shareholder may differ from the interests of the_
_holders of the Notes.”_


-----

**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS**

Our principal shareholders are (a) Permira Funds, a European private equity firm, which holds a 63.9%
beneficial interest in the Group; (b) the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, an independent single-profession
pension plan in Canada, which holds a 27.7% beneficial interest in the Group; and (c) certain members of our
management which hold a 8.2% beneficial interest in the Group (together, “Principal Shareholders,” and
individually, each a “Principal Shareholder”).

Permira Funds is a European private equity firm with a global reach. Permira, as adviser to the Permira
Funds, has approximately 130 professionals in 14 offices worldwide; Frankfurt, Guernsey, Hong Kong, London,
Luxembourg, Madrid, Menlo Park, Milan, New York, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Stockholm and Tokyo. Since 1985,
it has raised €32 billion of committed capital across 15 buy-out funds. Over the last three decades, Permira Funds
has completed over 200 transactions, investing across its five sectors: technology, consumer, financial services,
healthcare and industrials.

OTPP is one of the world’s largest and most successful independent investment organizations, with
C$207.4 billion in assets under management at December 31, 2019. Private Capital (“PC”) is the private equity
arm of OTPP and is an important element of the organization’s overall investment program. OTPP’s status as an
unlimited life fund with long-dated pension liabilities and a strong desire to grow its direct private equity portfolio
allows for the adoption of a differentiated approach to its investments. PC’s mandate is to deliver superior riskadjusted returns over the long term by focusing on sustainable value creation, and PC is not required or expected
to generate short-term gains or provide liquidity for the pension plan. Hence, PC focuses on long-term value
creation, not on short-term profits or financial engineering, and PC has the ability and the desire to hold attractive
investments for extended periods without regard to artificial investment horizons. With approximately 85
investment professionals and over C$39.3 billion in assets under management, PC manages direct private equity
investments and co-investments around the world. Since its inception in 1991, PC has deployed over C$55 billion
in capital across more than 500 transactions.

In addition to holding our capital stock, our Principal Shareholders hold certain subordinated shareholder
funding claims that will not mature or require cash payments of any kind prior to the date that is six months (or,
in the case of the Subordinated Shareholder Funding, three months) subsequent to the maturity date of the Notes.
We do not account for such claims as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet.


-----

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

We enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates from time to time and in the
ordinary course of our business. We believe these agreements are on terms no more favorable to the related parties
or our affiliates than they would expect to negotiate with disinterested third parties. In addition to the transactions
disclosed in Note 31 of the 2019 Group Consolidated Financial Statements, certain related party transactions are
described below.

**Management Equity Participation Program**

Upon the acquisition of shares and shareholder loan notes in Metis Bidco Limited, members of our UK
Division and our DACH Division management respectively (the “Members”) participated in the management
equity participation program implemented at the level of Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., a Luxembourg private
limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée), having its registered office at 488, route de Longwy,
L-1940 Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg Trade Companies’ Register under number B 197.495,
through Garfunkelux Nominee S.à r.l., a Luxembourg private limited liability company (société à responsabilité
_limitée), having its registered office at 488, route de Longwy, L-1940 Luxembourg and registered with the_
Luxembourg Trade Companies’ Register under number B 197.352 (the “Nominee”) acting as nominee for such
Members and holding a legal title to the shares issued by Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., in accordance with
nominee deeds dated October 13, 2015 as amended from time to time. The interests subscribed by the managers
are held subject to and in accordance with the terms set out in an investment and shareholders’ agreement entered
into between, among others, the Nominee and Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., dated October 13, 2015.

**Indemnification Arrangements**

To provide protection to individuals serving as our directors and executive officers, the current articles
of association provide each of our present and former officers with an indemnity against loss or liability to the
extent allowed by law. In addition, we maintain D&O insurance for the entire Group.

**Consulting Services**

Under the terms of the Existing Indentures we are permitted, and under the terms of the Indenture we
will be permitted to pay up to £2.0 million per year plus certain additional amounts to Permira Funds for annual
management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and related expenses.

**Management Loans**

One senior management employee has entered into a loan agreement with Lowell Holding GmbH for the
purposes of acquiring company shares and other senior management may enter into similar loans in the future.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements to which we
are a party. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of such
arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual agreements. For further information
regarding our existing indebtedness, see “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of the Group’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and structure_**

On June 29, 2015, Lowell Holding GmbH (as original borrower), the Issuer and Lowell Holding GmbH
(as original guarantors), the Parent (as topco in respect of certain specific provisions), Goldman Sachs Bank USA,
Credit Suisse AG, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, London Branch and ING Bank, a Branch of ING-DiBa AG
(as lenders), ING Bank N.V. (as facility agent) and Citibank, N.A., London Branch (as security agent) (amongst
others) (the “Original RCF Parties”) entered into a revolving credit facility agreement. On August 18, 2015,
May 2, 2018 (the “2018 Amendment and Restatement Agreement”), December 17, 2019 and on October 21,
2020 (the “2020 Amendment and Restatement Agreement”), the Original RCF Parties (amongst others) entered
into amendment and restatement agreements or amendment letters (as applicable) in respect of such revolving
credit facility agreement, pursuant to which such revolving credit facility agreement was or, in relation to the 2020
Amendment and Restatement Agreement will on or around the Issue Date be amended and/or restated (such
revolving credit facility agreement, as amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Revolving Credit Facility
**Agreement” and the facility provided thereunder, the “Revolving Credit Facility”).**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will provide for borrowings of up to €455.0 million on a
committed basis. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in euro, U.S. dollars, Pound Sterling or certain other currencies (if agreed)
by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of Letters of Credit (upon the appointment of an Issuing Bank) and by
way of any Ancillary Facilities that may be made available thereunder (each as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement). Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time.
Borrowings are available to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group (as defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) including, without limitation, for payment of interest under the Notes.

In addition, the Issuer may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility or as additional
tranches of an existing facility under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Additional Facility
**Commitments”) in amounts up to the greater of £500 million and 17.5% of the Group’s 84-month ERC. The**
Issuer and the lenders may agree to certain terms in relation to the Additional Facility Commitments, including
the margin, the termination date and the availability period (each subject to parameters as set out in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement). There are certain limitations (including as to maximum amount) on the ability to incur
Additional Facility Commitments.

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility is able to be utilized from (but excluding) the GFKL Acquisition
Completion Date until the date falling one month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

Lowell Holding GmbH is the original borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility. A mechanism is
included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to enable certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to accede as
additional borrowers or additional guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain conditions.
Lowell Financial Services GmbH, Simon Bidco Limited, Lowell Financial Ltd and Lowell Portfolio I Ltd have
acceded as additional borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
also requires that, subject to, for the avoidance of doubt, the section entitled “Guarantees” below, in the future
each member of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) which is or becomes a Material
Company (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), or is otherwise required to become a guarantor
in order to satisfy the Guarantor Coverage Test (as defined below), becomes an additional guarantor under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (subject to agreed security principles).


-----

**_Maturity and Repayment Requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date falling on the earlier of (i) 57 months after the effective
date under the 2020 Amendment and Restatement Agreement and (ii) three months prior to the earliest originally
scheduled final maturity of any Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes (as applicable) (each as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) then outstanding. Each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period
relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding
amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the
Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility
may be re-borrowed during its availability period, subject to certain conditions. The termination date for a facility
under an Additional Facility Commitment is the date agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

The interest rate on loans under the Revolving Credit Facility is the rate per annum equal to the aggregate
of the applicable margin plus LIBOR (or, in relation to advances in euro, EURIBOR) (as each term is defined in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). The initial margin under the Revolving Credit Facility was 3.50% per
_annum. Given that at least twelve months have expired since June 30, 2015, provided that no event of default has_
occurred and is continuing, the margin on the loans shall be reduced if the ratio of Consolidated Leverage (less
certain cash and cash equivalents) to Consolidated EBITDA for a period of twelve months ending on any quarter
date (subject to certain provisions and adjustments) are met. The current margin under the Revolving Credit
Facility is 3.25% per annum.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility which began to accrue from (and including) the GFKL Acquisition Completion Date to (and including)
the last day of the availability period for the Revolving Credit Facility at the rate of 35% of the then applicable
margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of
the availability period of the Revolving Credit Facility and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled
in full or on the date on which a lender’s commitment is cancelled.

Default interest on overdue amounts is calculated at a rate which is 1% higher than that applicable to the
loans under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the facility agent and the Security Agent in
connection with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Guarantees_**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have provided a senior guarantee of all amounts payable to the Finance
Parties (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) by them or any of their subsidiaries which accede
to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional borrowers or additional guarantors.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles) each
subsidiary of the Issuer that is or becomes a Material Company (which definition includes, among other things,
any member of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) that has earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing more than 5% of our consolidated EBITDA or gross
assets representing more than 5% of the gross assets of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement), subject to certain exceptions) will be required to become an additional guarantor under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement within 60 days following delivery of the annual financial statements for the relevant
fiscal year demonstrating that such subsidiary is a Material Company.

Furthermore, if on the last day of a fiscal year of the Issuer the guarantors under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement represent less than 80% of each of the consolidated EBITDA or the gross assets of the Group
(as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (subject to certain exceptions) (the “Guarantor
**Coverage Test”) the Issuer must, within 60 business days following the delivery of the annual financial statements**
for the relevant year, cause sufficient members of the Group to accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
as additional guarantors (subject to agreed security principles and certain exceptions) to satisfy the Guarantor
Coverage Test (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had been guarantors on such last day of the
relevant fiscal year).


-----

**_Security_**

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral
(whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes) will be required to be applied to repay indebtedness
outstanding in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility in priority to the Notes.

Any Material Company or other member of the Group (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) which becomes a guarantor of the Revolving Credit Facility is required (subject to agreed security
principles) to grant security over certain of its material assets and (if wholly owned by another member or
members of the Group) to have its shares (or equivalent ownership interests) secured in favor of the Security
Agent.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties,
subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and
with certain representations and warranties being repeated, including: (i) status and incorporation; (ii) binding
obligations; (iii) non-conflict with constitutional documents, laws or other obligations; (iv) power and authority;
(v) authorizations; (vi) governing law and enforcement; (vii) no event of default; and (viii) accuracy of most recent
financial statements delivered.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain incurrence covenants and related definitions
(with certain adjustments) that will reflect the terms of the Indenture. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement also contains certain other affirmative and negative covenants. Set forth below is a brief description
of such covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other qualifications,
exceptions and baskets.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a financial covenant, a brief description of which
is set out below.

**_Notes Purchase Condition_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement restricts the repayment, prepayment, purchase, redemption,
defeasance, acquisition or retirement of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes Debt or any permitted
refinancing thereof prior to its scheduled maturity date in any manner which involves the payment of cash
consideration by a member of the Group to a person who is not a member of the Group (each as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (a "SSN Payment"). A SSN Payment is permitted under certain
circumstances, including where commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are permanently cancelled (and,
as applicable, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility are permanently prepaid) in at least the
same proportion as that by which the Senior Secured Notes Debt or permitted refinancing thereof (as applicable)
is repaid, prepaid, purchased, redeemed, defeased, acquired or otherwise retired (calculated by reference to the
total Revolving Credit Facility commitments (as at the date the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement was entered
into) and the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes Debt or permitted refinancing thereof (as
applicable) in existence at the GFKL Acquisition Completion Date or incurred at any time thereafter) at a time
when no Event of Default (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) is continuing or would result
from such payment. If the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility have been reduced to €70 million no
further cancellation and repayment under the notes purchase condition shall be required as a condition to making
a SSN Payment (provided that no event of default is continuing or would result from such SSN Payment).

**_Affirmative Covenants_**

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information, including
annual audited and quarterly financial statements, compliance certificates and an annual budget; (ii)
authorizations, (iii) compliance with laws and regulations; (iv) payment of taxes; (v) maintenance of material
assets; (vi) maintenance of pari passu ranking of the Revolving Credit Facility; (vii) preservation of rights under
the German Acquisition Documents and UK Acquisition Documents (each as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement); (viii) maintenance of insurance arrangements; (ix) rights of access for the facility agent and
Security Agent; (x) maintenance of intellectual property; (xi) satisfaction of Guarantor Coverage Test; and (xii)
further assurance provisions.


-----

**_Negative Covenants_**

The negative covenants include restrictions, among others, with respect to: (i) substantially changing the
general nature of the business of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement); (ii) the
holding company activities of the Issuer, Simon Holdco Limited, Simon Midco Limited and Lowell Holding
GmbH; (iii) amending, waiving or terminating the terms of the German Acquisition Documents and UK
Acquisition Documents (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement); (iv) deliberately changing
centers of main interest; and (v) non-compliance with economic sanctions. Otherwise, the negative covenants in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be substantially the same as the negative covenants in the Indenture.

**_Covenant Suspension_**

Certain of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be suspended upon (i) a
public offering of equity securities by any member of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) or any of the Issuer’s holding companies and an achievement of a Leverage Ratio (defined as the
ratio of Consolidated Net Indebtedness on the last day of such period to Consolidated EBITDA for the period of
the most recent four consecutive financial quarters, each such term as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) equal to or less than 2.00:1 (pro forma for any prepayment of certain indebtedness from the proceeds
of such public offering) or (ii) an achievement by the Issuer (or any of its affiliates) of a long-term corporate credit
rating of Baa3/BBB− or better (as applicable) by Moody’s Investor Services Limited or Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services.

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

On a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), each lender under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement shall be entitled for a 30-day period after receiving notice thereof to require
that all amounts payable under the Senior Finance Documents (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) by the obligors to that lender will become immediately due and payable and the borrowers will
immediately prepay or procure the prepayment of all utilizations provided by that lender and the undrawn
commitments of that lender will be cancelled and such lender shall have no obligation to participate in further
utilizations requested under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, in each case save to the extent that any
ancillary lender or issuing bank, as between itself and the relevant member of the Group, agrees to continue to
provide an ancillary facility or letter(s) of credit, in which case, after notification thereof to the facility agent such
arrangements shall continue on a bilateral basis and not as part of, or under, the Senior Finance Documents (each
defined term as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

**_Financial Covenant_**

If, on any quarter date in respect of the period of the most recent four consecutive financial quarters, the aggregate
amount outstanding of all loan utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds an amount equal to 30 per
cent. of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Issuer is required to confirm whether or
not the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and representing the ratio of
Consolidated Leverage (less certain cash and cash equivalents) on such quarter date to Consolidated EBITDA for
the period of the most recent four consecutive financial quarters (subject to certain provisions and adjustments)
(the first such period ending on the first quarter date that falls at least three months after the GFKL Acquisition
Completion Date, each such term as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)) exceeds 7.00:1.00. The
covenant is tested quarterly.

Any excess in the financial ratio test set out above will only permit the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement to prevent a new utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding rollovers of existing
utilizations) and will not constitute, or result in, a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking, default,
event of default or other term in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any finance documents pertaining
thereto.

The Issuer is permitted to prevent or cure excesses in the Leverage Ratio as described above by applying any cure
amount (being amounts received by the Issuer in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted subordinated debt)
as if Consolidated Net Indebtedness (as defined the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) had been reduced by
such amount. There is no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility.
No more than four cure amounts may be taken into account during the term of the Revolving Credit Facility and
cure amounts in successive financial quarters are not permitted.


-----

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains substantially the same events of default, with certain
adjustments, as those applicable to the Notes as set forth in the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Events
_of Default.” In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains the following events of default:_

    - inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made;

    - breach of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

    - unlawfulness, repudiation, rescission, invalidity or unenforceability of the finance documents
entered into in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

UK/Luxembourg Post-Completion Debtors, the German Post-Completion Debtors, the March 2018 Debtors, the
May 2018 Debtors and the September 2019 Debtor, the “Debtors”) may accede in the future. On the Issue Date,
the Trustee in its capacity as trustee under the Indenture will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting
a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of,
the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement on its behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the
Intercreditor Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes following the
Trustee’s accession to the Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue Date. It does not restate the Intercreditor

description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of
the Debtors, the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors, when payments can be made in respect
of debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that indebtedness, the terms pursuant
to which certain of that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and
turnover provisions.

Unless otherwise defined in this section or elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum to the extent not
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement, capitalized terms set forth and used in this section have the same meanings
as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, which may have different meanings from the meanings given to such
terms and used elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities of the Debtors (other than any Senior Debt
Issuer, as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall rank in right and priority of payment in the following order

**Guarantee Liabilities,” and, together with the Permitted Senior Financing Issuer Liabilities,**
the “Senior Liabilities”) pari passu and without any preference between them;

c. **_third, the Holdco (Proceeds Loans) Liabilities;_**

d. **_fourth, the Intra-Group Liabilities; and_**

e. **_fifth, the Holdco Liabilities (other than the Holdco (Proceeds Loans) Liabilities)._**

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the liabilities of any Senior Debt Issuer shall rank in right

**_Priority of Security_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that (subject to the proceeds of such security being distributed in

to secure those liabilities).

The Intercreditor Agreement contemplates that certain of the Collateral that is permitted to also be for,
or is expressed to be for, or is not prohibited from being for, the benefit of the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors
by the terms of the finance documents shall be “Shared Security” as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement (the

extent that such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities).

The Investor Liabilities, the Holdco Liabilities and the Intra-Group Liabilities shall not be secured by the

**_Payments and Prepayments; Subordination of the Permitted Senior Financing Debt_**

The Debtors may make payments and prepayments in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the
Trustee Liabilities at any time in accordance with their terms.

The Debtors may make payments and prepayments in respect of the Priority Hedging Agreements and
the Non-Priority Hedging Agreements if such payment is a scheduled payment arising under any such agreement
or other customary payments under such agreement.

Any Senior Debt Issuer may make payments and prepayments in respect of any Senior Liabilities at any
time in accordance with the terms of the relevant senior finance documents in its capacity as a borrower, issuer or
equivalent.

Prior to the discharge of all Senior Secured Liabilities and all the Super Senior Creditor Liabilities due
to the RCF Lenders (themselves the “Senior Secured Debt Liabilities” and such date being “Senior Secured
**Debt Discharge Date” and with the discharge date of all Super Senior Creditor Liabilities due to the RCF Lenders**
being the “RCF Lenders Discharge Date”), no member of the Group may make payments in respect of the
Senior Liabilities without the Required Senior Consent (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
except, and in addition to the paragraph above, as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement including the
following:

1. if:

a. the payment is of:


-----

i. any of the principal amount of or capitalized interest on the Senior Liabilities which is
either (1) not prohibited from being paid by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) or any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt finance document or (2)
paid on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Senior Liabilities or, in each case,
a corresponding amount of Holdco Liabilities; or

ii. any other amount which is not an amount of principal or previously capitalized interest
(including any scheduled interest (whether cash pay or payment-in-kind) and default
interest) or a corresponding amount of Holdco Liabilities;

b. no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking payments in
respect of the Senior Liabilities (a “Senior Payment Stop Notice”) is outstanding; and

c. no event of default under the finance documents in respect of the Senior Secured Debt Liabilities
arising by reason of non-payment of any amounts due in connection therewith (a “Senior
**Secured Payment Default”) has occurred and is continuing; or**

2. certain amounts due to any ICA Trustee for its own account;

3. costs and expenses of any holder of a mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other security interest having a
similar effect (“Security”) in relation to the protection, preservation or enforcement of such Security;

4. administrative and maintenance costs, taxes, fees and expenses of any Senior Debt Issuer (in its capacity
as a borrower or issuer) incurred in respect of or in relation to (or reasonably incidental to) any Permitted
Senior Debt Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements), provided that
such costs and expenses are not incurred in respect of current, threatened or pending litigation against
the Secured Parties (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (other than any Permitted
Senior Financing Creditor); or

5. costs, commissions, taxes, fees, premiums and expenses incurred in respect of or in relation to (or
reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities not prohibited by
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and any Permitted Senior Secured
Financing Document.

Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, if a Senior Secured Payment Default is continuing all
payments in respect of the Senior Liabilities (other than those for which Required Senior Consent has been
obtained) will be suspended.

In addition, if an event of default (other than a Senior Secured Payment Default) under the finance
documents in respect of the Senior Secured Debt Liabilities (each “Senior Secured Event of Default”) is
continuing and any relevant Permitted Senior Financing Representative has received a Senior Payment Stop
Notice from either the RCF Facility Agent or a Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as such term is defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) or other relevant representative of the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt (each,
a “Senior Secured Agent”), from the date the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Representative, the Security
Agent and the Parent receive the Senior Payment Stop Notice, all payments in respect of Senior Liabilities (other
than those for which Required Senior Consent has been obtained) are suspended until the earliest of:

a. 179 days after the receipt by the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Representative of the
Senior Payment Stop Notice;

b. if a Senior Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of that
Senior Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Senior Standstill Period expires;

c. the date on which there is a waiver or remedy of the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default;

d. the date on which the Senior Secured Agent which delivered the Senior Payment Stop Notice
notifies (among others) the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Representative, the Security
Agent and the Parent that the Senior Payment Stop Notice is cancelled;

e. the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date; and


-----

f. the date on which the Security Agent or Senior Secured Agent takes any enforcement action
(including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions) (“Enforcement
**Action”) against a Debtor which it is permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor**
Agreement,

_provided that none of the circumstances described above shall prevent the Senior Debt Issuer from_
making or the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors from receiving payments in respect of the Senior Liabilities
in accordance with the terms of the relevant Permitted Senior Debt Documents as a borrower and/or an issuer but
only to the extent that the payment is not funded from the proceeds of a payment received from a member of the
Group which is otherwise prohibited by the above or the relevant provisions in respect of Holdco Liabilities.

No new Senior Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Senior Secured Agent unless 360 days have
elapsed since the immediately prior Senior Payment Stop Notice. No Senior Payment Stop Notice may be served
in respect of a Senior Secured Event of Default more than 60 days after the date that the Senior Secured Agent
received notice of that Senior Secured Event of Default. No Senior Secured Agent may serve more than one Senior
Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, and no Senior Payment Stop Notice
may be served in respect of a Senior Secured Event of Default notified to a Senior Secured Agent at the time at
which an earlier Senior Payment Stop Notice was issued.

If a Senior Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding or the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default
or Senior Secured Payment Default has ceased to be continuing (by being waived by the relevant
creditors/creditor’s representative or remedied) the relevant Debtor may then make those payments it would have
otherwise been entitled to pay under the Permitted Senior Financing Debt and if it does so promptly any Senior
Event of Default (and any cross-default or similar provision under any other debt document) which may have
occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any notice which may have been issued
as a result of that Senior Event of Default shall be waived. A Senior Secured Payment Default is remedied by the
payment of all amounts then due.

**_Restrictions on Enforcement by the Permitted Senior Financing Debt; Senior Standstill Period_**

Without prejudice to the rights of the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors to take Enforcement Action
in relation to the Permitted Senior Financing Issuer Liabilities, prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date,
no Permitted Senior Financing Creditor shall:

a. direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any Transaction
Security; or

b. take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Guarantee
Liabilities,

without the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group (as defined below), except that such
restriction will not apply if:

a. an event of default under the finance documents in respect of the Senior Liabilities (a “Senior
**Event of Default”) is continuing;**

b. each Senior Secured Agent has received notice of the relevant Senior Event of Default from the
relevant Permitted Senior Financing Representative;

c. a Senior Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

d. the relevant Senior Event of Default is continuing at the end of the Senior Standstill Period.

A “Senior Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the relevant Permitted Senior
Financing Representative serves an enforcement notice on each of the Senior Secured Agents until the earliest of:

a. 179 days after such date;

b. the date on which the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a
particular guarantor of the Senior Liabilities (a “Senior Guarantor”), _provided that the_
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action against such
Senior Guarantor as is taken by the Senior Secured Parties;


-----

c. the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of any Senior Guarantor, in which case
Enforcement Action is to be taken only against such Senior Guarantor;

d. the date of the consent of the relevant Senior Secured Agents (acting on behalf of the relevant
creditors); and

e. the expiration of any other Senior Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the
current Senior Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or permitted
remedy thereof).

**_Consultation_**

Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, if the Security Agent has received Conflicting
Enforcement Instructions (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), it shall promptly notify each Hedge
Counterparty (as applicable) and the Senior Secured Agents (each, an “Agent”) and such Agents will consult with
each other and the Security Agent in good faith for 30 days from the earlier of (i) the date of the latest such
Conflicting Enforcement Instruction and (ii) the date falling ten Business Days after the date the original
Enforcement Proposal (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) is delivered in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement (the “Consultation Period”).

No such consultation shall be required where the Agents are in agreement with regard to any proposed
Enforcement Action, or if:

a. any of the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event; or

b. creditors holding more than 66[2/3]% of the participations in the Super Senior Credit Liabilities
(the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) or the creditors holding more than 50% of the
participations in the Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”)
determine in good faith (and notify each other representative agent of the Super Senior
Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors and the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors,
as applicable) that any delay caused by such consultation could reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction
Security or the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security; or

c. if the relevant Senior Secured Agents agree that no consultation period is required.

Following the Consultation Period (or if the Consultation Period was terminated or not required as
provided for above), there shall be no further obligation to consult and the Security Agent may act in accordance
with the instructions as to enforcement (an “Enforcement”) then or previously received from the Instructing
Group (as defined below) and the Instructing Group may issue instructions as to Enforcement to the Security
Agent at any time thereafter.

If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably)
consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in a manner which is not consistent with
the Security Enforcement Principles (as defined below), subject to the above, the relevant Senior Secured Agent
shall give notice to the other representatives after which each such representative shall consult with the Security
Agent for a period of 30 days (or such lesser period as the Senior Secured Agents may agree) with a view to
agreeing the manner of Enforcement, provided that such representatives shall not be obliged to consult more than
once in relation to each Enforcement

For the purposes of Enforcement, an “Instructing Group” means, if prior to the Credit Facility Lender
Discharge Date (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Majority Super Senior Creditors and
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if:

a. the Super Senior Creditor Liabilities have not been repaid in full in cash within six months of
the date of the first instructions of Enforcement given to the Security Agent; or

b. the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu thereof) or
other Enforcement Action within three months of the date of the first instructions of
Enforcement given to the Security Agent,


-----

then the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are given (at the same time or
subsequently) by the Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same comply with the Security
Enforcement Principles (“Qualifying Instructions”) to the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors) and “Instructing Group” in relation to such Enforcement shall mean the Majority Super Senior
Creditors.

Subject to the foregoing, if at the end of the Consultation Period, the Security Agent has received
Conflicting Enforcement Instructions then, in relation to such Enforcement, “Instructing Group” shall mean the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that such instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
are Qualifying Instructions, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the timeframe for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction Security or
Distressed Disposal (as defined below) pursuant to such instructions will be determined by the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors.

**_Security Enforcement Principles_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that Enforcement instructions must be consistent with the
following principles (the “Security Enforcement Principles”):

a. It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to
maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from
Enforcement of the Transaction Security, recovery by the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior
Secured Creditors (the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

b. The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such
that either (i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for
distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall (as defined below); or (ii) if
Enforcement is at the direction of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, sufficient proceeds
from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the
proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Creditor
Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree
otherwise).

c. The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject
to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value
from the Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal will be determined by
the Instructing Group, provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective.

d. On (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares
in a member of the Holdco Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds
€5,000,000 (or its equivalent); or (ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security
over some or all of the shares in a member of the Holdco Group over which Transaction Security
exists, the Security Agent shall, upon instruction from the Instructing Group (unless it is
incompatible with enforcement proceedings in a relevant jurisdiction) appoint an accounting
firm of international standing and reputation, any reputable and independent international
investment bank or other reputable and independent professional services firm with experience
in restructuring and enforcement, in each case as selected by the Security Agent acting
reasonably and in good faith (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert that the proceeds
received from any such Enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into
account all relevant circumstances (the “Financial Advisor’s Opinion”).

e. The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the
advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement.

f. The Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in
relation to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a
financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive
evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.


-----

g. Where the Instructing Group is the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors may waive the requirement for a Financial Advisor’s Opinion where
sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure
that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall below, the Super
Senior Creditor Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full.

h. In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred
to in (d) above and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, the Super Senior
Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors shall be entitled to participate in such auction on the
basis of equal information and access rights as other bidders and financiers in the auction. There
is no requirement in the Security Enforcement Principles summarized in this paragraph (h) that
requires the Enforcement of Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction.

i. In the absence of written notice from a Secured Party or group of Secured Parties that are not
part of the relevant Instructing Group that such Secured Party/ies object to any Enforcement of
the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve
the Security Enforcement Objective (an “Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to assume
that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security
Enforcement Objective.

j. If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security
Agent to rely on other advisors and/or exercise its own judgment in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement), a Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained
by the Security Agent in relation to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such
action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances)
to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the
Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the requirement of paragraph
(a) above has been met.

The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent
of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that no additional
obligations may be imposed on a member of the Holdco Group without the consent of the Issuer.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exclusions set out therein, the Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Senior
Secured Creditors, Permitted Senior Financing Creditors or Super Senior Creditors (each, a “Primary Creditor”)
receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of all or part of the Transaction Security or any Distressed
Disposal other than in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, then it shall:

    - in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold an amount
of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities on trust for the Security Agent and
separate from other assets, property or funds and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay
an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities
to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
and

    - in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

Certain further turnover obligations following receipt of non-permitted payments apply to Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors and Subordinated Creditors.

**_Application of Proceeds/Waterfall_**

All amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the
realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security (other than the Shared Security) and all
amounts required to be turned over pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Enforcement Proceeds”) shall
be applied by the Security Agent at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, in the following order of priority (the “Payments Waterfall”):


-----

    - _first, in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any of its delegates, on_
a pro rata and pari passu basis;

    - _second, in discharging (i) any Agent Liabilities, (ii) any Arranger Liabilities and (iii) any Trustee_
Liabilities, on a pro rata and pari passu basis;

    - _third, in or towards payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Super Senior Creditors or_
Senior Secured Creditors in connection with any realization or enforcement of the Transaction
Security (other than Shared Security) taken in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

    - _fourth, in payment to the Super Senior Creditors for application towards the discharge of the Super_
Senior Creditor Liabilities on a pro rata basis and pari passu;

    - _fifth, in payment to the Senior Secured Creditors for application towards the discharge of the_
Liabilities owed to the Senior Secured Creditors on a pro rata basis and pari passu;

    - _sixth, after the Final Discharge Date (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), in payment of the_
balance, if any, to the relevant Debtor or any other person entitled to it.

All amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the
realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Shared Security shall be applied by the Security Agent at any
time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in the following
order of priority:

    - _first, in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any of its delegates, on_
a pro rata and pari passu basis;

    - _second, in discharging (i) any Agent Liabilities or (ii) Arranger Liabilities and (iii) any Trustee_
Liabilities, on a pro rata and pari passu basis;

    - _third, in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any Super Senior Creditor or Senior_
Secured Creditor in connection with any realization or enforcement of the Shared Security taken in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security
Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement;

    - _fourth, in payment to the Super Senior Creditors for application towards the discharge of the Super_
Senior Creditor Liabilities on a pro rata basis and pari passu;

    - _fifth, in payment to the Senior Secured Creditors for application towards the discharge of the_
Liabilities owed to the Senior Secured Creditors on a pro rata basis and pari passu;

    - _sixth, in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any Permitted Senior Financing Creditor in_
connection with any realization or enforcement of the Shared Security taken in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

    - _seventh, in payment to the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors for application towards the_
discharge of the Senior Liabilities on a pro rata basis and pari passu; and

    - _eighth, following the Final Discharge Date, the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor_
to the relevant Debtor or any other person entitled to it.

**_Release and/or Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in Respect of the Permitted Senior Financing Debt and the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes and the Transaction Security_**

Non-distressed Disposal

The Security Agent will (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly release
from the Transaction Security and the relevant documents:


-----

    - any Transaction Security (and/or any other claim relating to a relevant finance document (a
“Secured Debt Document”)) over any asset which is the subject of:

i. a disposal not prohibited by the terms of any Secured Debt Document (provided that,
in the case of a disposal to a member of the Holdco Group, the section entitled “Release
of Liens” in the July 2015 Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or any equivalent provision
in any other Secured Debt Document (including the Indenture)) are, or will be,
complied with by the relevant members of the Holdco Group); or

ii. any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Secured Debt Document
pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Holdco
Group;

    - any Transaction Security (and/or any other claim relating to a Secured Debt Document) over any
document or other agreement requested in order for any member of the Holdco Group to effect any
amendment or waiver in respect of that document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights,
comply with any obligations or take any action in relation to that document or agreement (in each
case to the extent not prohibited by the terms of any Secured Debt Document);

    - any Transaction Security (and/or any other claim relating to a Secured Debt Document) over any
asset of any member of the Holdco Group which has ceased to be a Debtor in accordance with the
terms of the Secured Debt Documents; and

    - any Transaction Security (and/or any other claim relating to a Secured Debt Document) over any
other asset to the extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Secured Debt
Documents.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company of
any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor) will
cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor, in each case, provided that such disposal or other transaction is
not prohibited under a Secured Debt Document, the Security Agent will (at the request and cost of the relevant
Debtor or the Parent) promptly release that Debtor and its Subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities (both
actual and contingent) under the Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its
Subsidiaries (and the shares in any such Debtor and/or Subsidiary) from the Transaction Security and the Secured
Debt Documents (including any claims relating to a Secured Debt Document and any guarantee or other
liabilities).

When making any request for a release pursuant to the above the Parent will confirm in writing to the
Security Agent that: (i) in the case of any release requested pursuant to sub-paragraph (i) above, the relevant
disposal or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Secured Debt Document and, in the case of a disposal
to a member of the Holdco Group, the section entitled “Release of Liens” in the July 2015 Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (or any equivalent provision in any other Secured Debt Document (including the Indenture)) are, or will
be, complied with by the relevant members of the Holdco Group); and (ii) the release requested (or relevant action
needing the release) is in accordance with (or is not prohibited by) the terms of, any Secured Debt Document and
the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt
Documents.

The Security Agent will (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor but without the need for any
further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Debtor) promptly enter into and
deliver such documentation and/or take such other action as the Parent (acting reasonably) will require to give
effect to any release or other matter contemplated by this section.

Without prejudice to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, if requested by the Parent in
accordance with the terms of any of the Secured Debt Documents, the Security Agent and the other Secured Party
will (at the cost of the relevant Debtor and/or the Parent) promptly execute any guarantee, security or other release
and/or any amendment, supplement or other documentation relating to the Transaction Security documents as
contemplated by the terms of any of the Secured Debt Documents (and the Security Agent is authorized by the
Secured Parties to execute, and will promptly execute if requested by the Parent, without the need for any further
any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Secured Party, any such release or document on
behalf of the Secured Parties). When making any request pursuant to this paragraph, the Parent will confirm in


-----

writing to the Security Agent that such request is in accordance with the terms of a Secured Debt Document and
the Security Agent will be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

In the case of any release of Transaction Security requested by the Issuer pursuant to the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement as part of a Permitted Transaction (as that term is defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) (a “Permitted Transaction Request”), when making that request the Issuer will confirm to
the Security Agent that:

    - such request is a Permitted Transaction Request (and absent any such statement in a request for a
release the Security Agent shall be entitled to assume for all purposes that such request is not a
Permitted Transaction Request); and

    - it has determined in good faith (taking into account any applicable legal limitations and other
relevant considerations in relation to that Permitted Transaction) that it is either not possible or not
desirable to implement that Permitted Transaction on terms satisfactory to the Issuer by granting
additional Transaction Security and/or amending the terms of the existing Transaction Security in
lieu of the requested release,

and the Security Agent will be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured
Debt Documents.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Permitted Senior Debt
Documents, if any member of the Holdco Group is required to apply, or not prohibited under the Permitted Senior
Debt Documents from applying, the proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or
any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Secured Liabilities:

    - no such application of those proceeds will require the consent of any party or Permitted Senior
Financing Creditor or will result in a direct or indirect breach of any Permitted Senior Debt
Document; and

    - any such application will discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment,
redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities.

The above paragraph is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Holdco Group to apply any
proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of
any Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities to the extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement
or not prohibited by any other Secured Debt Document.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized to:

    - release the Transaction Security; and

    - release each investor (an “Investor”), Debtor and other member of the Group from all liabilities,
undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent), subject, in
respect of the second bullet point above, to certain agency or trustee protective provisions in any of the Secured
Debt Documents, which will survive the termination of the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Distressed Disposal_

A “Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset of a member of the Holdco Group subject to the
Transaction Security which is:

a. being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction
Security has become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant Transaction
Security documents;

b. being effected by enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Transaction Security documents; or


-----

c. being effected, after the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, by a Debtor or the Parent to a
person or persons which is not a member of the Holdco Group.

Where a Distressed Disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent is authorized:

i. to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over that asset and execute and
deliver or enter into any release of that Transaction Security, or claim and issue any
letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may,
in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

ii. if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of an Debtor, to release
on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Debtors and Agents (a) that Debtor and any
subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of: (x) the liabilities it may have as a
principal Debtor in respect of financial indebtedness arising under the Debt Documents
(whether incurred solely or jointly) (the “Borrowing Liabilities”) (other than
Borrowing Liabilities of the Issuer and the Senior Debt Issuer); (y) the liabilities under
the Debt Documents (present or future, actual or contingent and whether incurred
solely or jointly) it may have as or as a result of its being a guarantor or surety or giving
an indemnity, contribution or subrogation and in particular any guarantee or indemnity
arising under or in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities Documents or the Permitted
Senior Debt Documents (as each such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
(the “Guarantee Liabilities”) and (z) any trading and other liabilities (not being
Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities) it may have to any Agent (other than
any Hedge Counterparty), Arranger (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement), any Intra-Group Lender or any Debtor (the “Other Liabilities”); (b) any
Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any
of its assets; and (c) any other claim of an Investor, an Intra-Group Lender, or other
Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor;

iii. if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding
company of a Debtor, to release on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Debtors and
Agents (a) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all
or any part of its Borrowing Liabilities (other than Borrowing Liabilities of the Issuer
or the Senior Debt Issuer), Guarantee Liabilities and Other Liabilities; (b) any
Transaction Security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding
company over any of its assets; and (c) any other claim of any Investor, Intra-Group
Lender or another Debtor over the assets of that holding company or of any subsidiary
of that holding company;

iv. if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent decides to dispose of all or any part of
(y) all present and future moneys, debts, liabilities and obligations due at any time of
any Debtor or any holding company of such Debtor or any subsidiary of such Debtor
or holding company owed to any Creditor under the Debt Documents, both actual and
contingent and whether incurred solely or jointly with any other person or in any other
capacity, together with any additional liabilities (the “Liabilities”) (other than
Borrowing Liabilities of the Issuer or the Senior Debt Issuer); or (z) any liabilities
owed by that Debtor to any other Debtor (whether actual or contingent and whether
incurred solely or jointly) (the “Debtor Liabilities”) (A) if the Security Agent does
not intend that any transferee of those Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities will be treated
as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part
of those Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities _provided that notwithstanding any other_
provision of any Debt Document, the transferee shall not be treated as a Primary
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if
the Security Agent does intend that any transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor
or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of (I) all (and not part only) of the
Liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors; and (II) all or part of any other Liabilities


-----

and the Debtor Liabilities, on behalf of, in each case the relevant creditors and Debtors;
and

v. if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the
holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent decides
to transfer to another Debtor all or part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any
obligations of any Subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of (x) the Intra-Group
Liabilities; (y) the Holdco Liabilities; or (z) the Debtor Liabilities, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to (A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the
obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities, Holdco Liabilities or Debtor
Liabilities on behalf of the relevant Intra-Group Lenders, the Holdco Lender and
relevant Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors
which owe those obligations; and (B) to accept the transfer of all or part of the
obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities, Holdco Liabilities or Debtor
Liabilities on behalf of the receiving entity or receiving entities to which the
obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities, Holdco Liabilities or Debtor
Liabilities are to be transferred.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that Shared Security or any
guarantees in respect of the Permitted Senior Financing Debt will be released or
Permitted Senior Financing Debt will be disposed of, it is a condition to the release
that either:

i. each Permitted Senior Financing Representative has approved the release and/or
disposal (as applicable) (acting on the instructions of the required percentage of
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors in respect of which it is the Permitted Senior
Financing Representative under the relevant Permitted Senior Debt Documents); or

ii. where shares or assets of a Senior Guarantor or assets of the Senior Debt Issuer are
sold:

A. the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and

B. all present or future obligations owed to the Super Senior Creditors and Senior
Secured Creditors under the applicable Secured Debt Documents (the
“Senior Secured Debt Documents”) and the Hedging Agreements by a
member of the Holdco Group all of whose shares are sold or disposed of
pursuant to such Distressed Disposal, are unconditionally released and
discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and such
obligations are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all
Transaction Security in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released concurrently with such sale,
provided that if each Senior Secured Agent (acting reasonably and in good
faith):

        - determines that the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured
Creditors (excluding in each case for these purposes the Hedge
Counterparties) will recover a greater amount if any such claim is sold
or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not
released and discharged; and

        - serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to
the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

C. such sale or disposal is made:

        - pursuant to a public auction; or

        - where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered
an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received


-----

in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking
into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement and the circumstances giving rise to such sale or disposal,
_provided that the liability of such Financial Adviser may be limited to_
the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select
or engage any Financial Adviser unless it shall have been indemnified
and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

**_Application of Proceeds of a Distressed Disposal_**

The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of Liabilities or Debtor
Liabilities) will be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—
_Application of Proceeds/Waterfall” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction_
Security.

**_Voting and Amendments_**

Voting in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes and/or Permitted Senior
Secured Financing Debt will be in accordance with the relevant documents.

Except for amendments of a minor, technical or administrative nature which may be effected by the
Security Agent and subject to the paragraph below and certain customary exceptions contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement, amendments to or waivers and consents under the Intercreditor Agreement require the written consent
of:

a. if the relevant amendment or waiver (the “Proposed Amendment”) is prohibited by the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the RCF Facility Agent in accordance with that
agreement;

b. if any Senior Secured Notes (including the Original Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes (as defined elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum)) have been issued and the
Proposed Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Senior Secured Notes Indenture
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the relevant Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as such
term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement);

c. if any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt has been incurred and the Proposed
Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Permitted Senior Secured Financing
Agreement, the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Representative in respect of that Permitted
Senior Secured Financing Debt in accordance with that agreement;

d. if any Permitted Senior Financing Debt (including the Existing Senior Notes) has been incurred
and the Proposed Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Permitted Senior Debt
Document, the Permitted Senior Financing Representative (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) in respect of that Permitted Senior Financing Debt in accordance with that
document;

e. if a Hedge Counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a Hedging Agreement, that
Hedge Counterparty (in each case only to the extent that the relevant amendment or waiver
adversely affects the continuing rights and/or obligations of that Hedge Counterparty and is an
amendment or waiver which is expressed to require the consent of that Hedge Counterparty
under the applicable Hedging Agreement, as notified by the Parent to the Security Agent at the
time of the relevant amendment or waiver);

f. the Investors; and

g. the Parent.

An amendment, waiver or consent which only affects secured parties under one Debt Document and does
not materially and adversely affect the interests of other creditors, will require only the written agreement from
the affected Secured Parties.


-----

Other than when any such amendments, waivers or consents would adversely affect the nature of the
Charged Property or the manner in which enforcement proceeds are applied, the Security Agent may, if authorized
by an Instructing Group, and if the Parent consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or grant
consents under, any of the Transaction Security documents which shall be binding on each party to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

An amendment, waiver or consent which adversely relates to the express rights or obligations of an
Agent, an Arranger or the Security Agent (in each case in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent
of that Agent, that Arranger or the Security Agent (as the case may be) at such time.

The terms of the immediately preceding paragraph do not apply to any release of Transaction Security,
claim or Liabilities or to any consent which the Security Agent gives in accordance with certain clauses of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Option to Purchase_**

Following an acceleration event under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indentures,
or the Indenture, in relation to any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt or in relation to any Permitted Senior
Financing Debt (an “Acceleration Event”), by giving 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, the holders of the
Original Senior Secured Notes or the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Liabilities (including the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes) may require the transfer to them of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations
in respect of the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), subject
to certain conditions (including but not limited to full payment of all Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, cash cover,
and associated costs and expenses, and provision of certain indemnities).

Following an Acceleration Event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security and after a Senior
Secured Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), a simple majority of the Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors may, by giving 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to them of all, but
not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities, provided that certain
conditions are met.

**_Hedging_**

All scheduled payments arising under a Hedging Agreement are permitted payments for the purposes of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions in relation to the circumstances in which a
Priority Hedge Counterparty and a Non-Priority Hedge Counterparty may take Enforcement Action in relation to
its hedging.

**_General_**

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions dealing with:

a. close-out rights for the Priority Hedge Counterparties and the Non-Priority Hedge
Counterparties;

b. permitted payments (including without limitation, the repayment of Investor Liabilities and the
payment of permitted distributions in each case to the extent not prohibited under the terms of
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indentures, the Indenture, or the finance
documents relating to the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt or the Permitted Senior
Financing Debt;

c. incurrence of Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt or additional Permitted Senior
Financing Debt that will allow certain creditors and agents with respect to such Permitted Senior
Secured Financing Debt or additional Permitted Senior Financing Debt, as the case may be, to
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and benefit from, and be subject to, the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement so long as not prohibited under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Existing Indentures or the Indenture; and


-----

d. customary protections for the Security Agent, any future Permitted Senior Financing
Representative, any future Permitted Senior Secured Financing Representative and the Trustee
of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and the courts of England have exclusive
jurisdiction to settle any disputes arising from it.

**Shareholder Loans**

In connection with the Lowell Acquisition, the Parent received from Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. a
subordinated loan (“Parent Subordinated SHL”) and the Issuer received from the Parent a subordinated loan
(together with the Parent Subordinated SHL, the “Subordinated SHLs”). Until no earlier than the date that is six
months subsequent to the maturity date of the latest maturing of the third-party debt of the Parent or the Issuer, as
applicable, the Subordinated SHLs will not require any cash payments, will not permit enforcements or
accelerations and must remain held by holders of the ordinary share capital of the Parent or the Issuer, as
applicable. The Subordinated SHLs constitute “Subordinated Shareholder Funding” under the Existing Indentures
and we expect they will constitute “Subordinated Shareholder Funding” under the Indenture. See Note 12 to the
Unaudited Group Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

On or before the Issue Date, as part of the Equity Contribution, the Parent will provide to the Issuer a
subordinated shareholder loan that matures three months after the latest maturity of the Notes, which we expect
will constitute “Subordinated Shareholder Funding” under the Indenture.

**Securitization Programs**

**_Milla Securitization_**

Lowell Holdco GmbH and certain of its subsidiaries have sold certain non-performing receivables to
Milla Securitisation (No. 1) Limited (“Milla”), a special purpose company established in Jersey, Channel Islands,
pursuant to certain receivables purchase agreements entered into between Lowell Holdco GmbH and certain of
its subsidiaries as sellers and Milla as purchaser. The outstanding principal amount of senior loans (the “Senior
**Loans”) under the Senior Loan Agreements (as defined below) was £13.6 million as of June 30, 2020.**

_Receivables Purchase Agreements and Portfolios_

Lowell Holdco GmbH, PCS and IBW (each a “Milla Seller” and together, the “Milla Sellers”) have
sold certain portfolios of non-performing receivables to Milla pursuant to separate receivables purchase
agreements entered into between the Milla Sellers as sellers and Milla as purchaser (the “Receivables Purchase
**Agreements”). Lowell Holdco GmbH has sold non-performing receivables originated by a German retailer from**
the mail order business and goods sold on credit to private individuals (the “German Retailer Portfolio”) to
Milla for a certain purchase price in 2013. PCS has sold non-performing receivables to Milla for a certain purchase
price in 2013 and has sold additional non-performing receivables to Milla for a certain purchase price in 2014
(together, the “PCS Portfolios”). IBW has sold non-performing receivables to Milla for a certain purchase price
in 2014 (the “IBW Portfolio” and, together with the Milla Portfolio and the PCS Portfolios, the “Portfolios”).

The respective Milla Sellers each provides certain representations and warranties for the benefit of Milla
as purchaser. The breach of some of the representations and warranties which relate to the sold receivables, may
result in an obligation of the Milla Seller to repurchase the affected sold receivable upon request from Milla at a
percentage of the pro rata share of the purchase price for the affected receivable by nominal outstanding balance
of the receivable plus interest accrued at a certain percentage until repurchase.

Under the Receivables Purchase Agreements, Milla has appointed the respective Milla Seller under that
Receivables Purchase Agreement (each, a “Servicer”) to service on behalf of Milla the receivables sold by that
Milla Seller for certain customary fees. Lowell Holdco GmbH has subcontracted the actual servicing activities to
its subsidiaries SIR, GPP, PCS, IBW, and ZYK as sub-servicers (the “Sub-Servicers”) which hold a collection
license pursuant to the German Act on Legal Services (Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz). The Sub-Servicers have
confirmed the sub-services in a separate agreement with Milla.


-----

_Senior and Subordinated Funding_

Milla has financed the payment of the purchase price for the acquisition of the Portfolios through funding
by way of certain senior loan agreements entered into between, inter alios, Milla as borrower and Goldman Sachs
Lending Partners LLC as original lender (the “Senior Loan Agreements”) and certain subordinated loan
agreements entered into between Milla as borrower and the respective Milla Seller as subordinated lender (the
“Subordinated Loan Agreements”). Payments by Milla of amounts owing by it are made pursuant to certain
priority of payment waterfalls (the “Priority of Payments”) set out in the documents.

With respect to Lowell Holdco GmbH and PCS as Milla Sellers of the German Retailer Portfolio and the
PCS Portfolios, Milla has entered into a senior loan agreement with Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC as
original lender and certain other transaction parties (as amended and restated on March 19, 2014, including an
increase of the commitment of the original lender). With respect to IBW as Milla Seller of the IBW Portfolio,
Milla has entered into a senior loan agreement with Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC as original lender and
certain other transaction parties. Milla is obliged to repay the Senior Loans in certain amounts on each payment
date in accordance with the Priority of Payments. The remainder shall be repaid at a certain repayment date. No
amount repaid may be re-borrowed.

The lenders under the Senior Loan Agreements are entitled to transfer all of their rights and obligations
under the Senior Loan Agreements to Lowell Holdco GmbH for a price being equal to the principal amount
outstanding under the Senior Loan Agreements, accrued and unpaid interest and outstanding costs, for a period of
one month after becoming aware of a change of control and if the cash payments actually provided are more than
20% below the planned expected cash flows on average over any aggregated period of three consecutive months
at any time during the life of the Milla Securitisation (the “Milla Put”). A “change of control” occurs, inter alia,
if any person or persons acting in concert acquire directly or indirectly more than 50% (or 30% after an initial
public offering) of the shares in Lowell Holdco GmbH (or the respective subsidiary of Lowell Holdco GmbH
acting as seller under the related Receivables Purchase Agreement) or such number of shares in Lowell Holdco
GmbH (or the respective subsidiary of Lowell Holdco GmbH acting as seller under the related Receivables
Purchase Agreement) carrying more than 50% of the voting rights normally exercisable at the general meetings
of Lowell Holdco GmbH or the respective subsidiary.

The obligations of Milla as borrower under the Senior Loan Agreements are secured by pledges over the
respective operating accounts, assignment of all rights and claims under the fiduciary agreements regarding the
collection accounts held by the servicers for the benefit of Milla and assignment of rights and claims of Milla
under the transaction documents (excluding the Subordinated Loan Agreements). The Senior Loan Agreements
contain certain negative and affirmative undertakings as well as a series of customary termination grounds, such
as failure to pay, breach of other obligations, misrepresentation, insolvency, insolvency proceedings, creditors’
process, unlawfulness and repudiation and material litigation.

In the event that Lowell Holdco GmbH were to be replaced as servicer under the Receivables Purchase
Agreement relating to the Milla Portfolio, Lowell Holdco GmbH is entitled to demand transfer of all of the rights
and obligations under the Senior Loan Agreements to itself.

Lowell Holdco GmbH, PCS and IBW as lenders have granted subordinated loans to Milla as borrower.
The claims of the lenders under the Subordinated Loan Agreements rank junior to those of the lenders under the
Senior Loan Agreements. Disbursement of each of the loans under the Subordinated Loan Agreements is set off
in a corresponding amount against the purchase price payable to the Milla Seller under the respective Receivables
Purchase Agreement and the sellers therefore did not receive the full purchase price in cash.

**_Luigi Securitization_**

On June 29, 2018, Lowell Receivables Financing 1 Limited, a special purpose vehicle, as borrower (the
“Borrower”), Lowell Portfolio I LTD as seller (the “Seller”), Citibank, N.A., London Branch as arranger and
Citibank, N.A., London Branch as agent, among others, entered into a senior loan agreement (the “2018 **Senior**
**Loan Agreement”) whereby the lenders named therein provided a senior loan (as amended to date, the “2018**
**Senior Loan”) to the Borrower, the proceeds of which were applied on November 20, 2018 towards refinancing**
the acquisition by the Borrower from the Seller of a portfolio of unsecured consumer debt obligations originated
in England and Wales and previously acquired by the Seller pursuant to the terms of the receivables sale and
purchase agreement. On May 5, 2019, the Receivables Sale and Purchase Agreement was amended and restated
to accommodate an extension and amendment of the 2018 Senior Loan. As June 30, 2020, £220.5 million was


-----

outstanding under the 2018 Senior Loan, out of total commitments of £255.0 million. The 2018 Senior Loan has
a margin of 2.85% and 1-month LIBOR and matures on April 10, 2024.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the
heading “Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Issuer” are to
Garfunkelux Holdco 3 S.A. only and not to any of its Subsidiaries. References to “we” or “us” or the “Group” are
to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Issuer will issue €   .0 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes
due 2026 (the “Floating Rate _Euro Notes”), €  .0 million aggregate principal amount of  % Senior Secured Notes_
due 2025 (the “Fixed Rate _Euro Notes” and, together with the Floating Rate Euro Notes, the “Euro Notes”) and £_
.0 million aggregate principal amount of  % Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Sterling Notes” and, together
with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of , 2020 (the
“Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Citibank,
N.A., London Branch, as paying agent, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”),
Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as registrar (the “Registrar”), Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as calculation
agent (the “Calculation Agent”), and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”), in
a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will
not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and
refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their
entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the
forms of Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Listing and General Information.”

The gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with the Equity
Contribution from the Parent, will be used, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of
_Proceeds,” (i) to redeem the Existing Notes, (ii) to partially repay drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility,_
(iii) to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions and (iv) for general corporate purposes, which
may include future debt portfolio purchases or repayment or redemption of Indebtedness. Upon the initial issuance
of the Notes, the Notes will be obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis.
See “—The Note Guarantees.”

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative
ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for
undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security
and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
guarantee the Notes.

**The Notes**

The Notes will:

    - be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer
under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;


-----

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;

    - be guaranteed by the Guarantors as described under “—The Note Guarantees”;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer
that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors;

    - mature, in the case of the Floating Rate Euro Notes, on   , 2026 and, in the case of the Fixed
Rate Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes, on       , 2025; and

    - be represented by one or more registered notes in global registered form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by certificated securities (“Definitive Registered Notes”) (see
“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”).

As of June 30, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on that
date, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had £1,661 million of net secured Indebtedness
(excluding local facilities and excluding Reserved Cash). In addition, as of the Issue Date there would have been
equivalent £     million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, the Parent, Lowell Holdco GmbH, Lowell Holding GmbH, Fredrickson
International Limited, GFKL Collections GmbH, Hansa Holdco Limited, IBW Verwaltungs- und Beteiligungs
GmbH, INKASSO BECKER WUPPERTAL GmbH & Co. KG, Lowell AS, Lowell Danmark A/S, Lowell
Financial Ltd, Lowell Finans A/S, Lowell Nordics Oy, Lowell Portfolio I Ltd, Lowell Solicitors Limited, Lowell
Suomi Oy, Lowell Sverige AB, Metis Bidco Limited, Proceed Collection Services GmbH, Simon Bidco, Simon
Holdco, Simon Midco and Sirius Inkasso GmbH (the “Initial Guarantors”) will guarantee the Notes on a senior
basis. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional
_Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted_
Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future (together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”).
The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

    - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor
that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee (including such
Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor
that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such
Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or
unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin
capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate
law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law


-----

which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal
capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law
procedures being complied with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed
Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by
general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is
disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By
virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note
Guarantee.

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of June 30, 2020, the Guarantors
represented 91% of the consolidated assets of the Group and 86% of Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA (as defined
in this Offering Memorandum and disregarding the EBITDA of any member of the Group that generates negative
EBITDA). Claims of creditors of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including trade creditors and
creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders
(if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted
Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The
Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors)
and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority
stockholders of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the
Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Note Guarantees Release_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

    - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock
of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as
a result of the sale or other disposition;

    - upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all
the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries), if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the Indenture;

    - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

    - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided
in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

    - upon the release of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;_

    - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, to the extent that (i) such Guarantor is unconditionally released and
discharged from its liabilities with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility prior to or substantially
concurrently with such termination and release and (ii) such Guarantor would not otherwise be
required at the time of such release to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;

    - in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

    - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;


-----

    - in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

    - with respect to an entity that is not the successor Guarantor, as a result of a transaction permitted
by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Guarantors.”

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested in writing by
the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject
to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee
and the Security Agent without the consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part
of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €  .0 million in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Euro
Notes, €  .0 million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Euro Notes and £  .0 million in aggregate
principal amount of Sterling Notes. The Floating Rate Euro Notes will mature on   , 2026 and each of the Fixed
Rate Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes will mature on   , 2025. The Euro Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and the Sterling Notes will be issued
in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Floating Rate Euro Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Euro Applicable Floating
_Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR_ _plus (ii)   %, as determined by the_
Calculation Agent, which will initially be Citibank, N.A., London Branch, or any successor thereof. Interest on
the Floating Rate Euro Notes will:

    - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
paid;

    - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on   ,   ,    and   , commencing on   , 2021;

    - be payable to the Holder of record of such Floating Rate Euro Notes on the Clearing System
Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date, or to the extent Definitive
Registered Notes have been issued, to the Holders of record of such Floating Rate Euro Notes on
the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date, as applicable; and

    - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Euro
Floating Rate Interest Period.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation
of interest on the Notes.

“EURIBOR,” with respect to a Euro Floating Rate Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Euro Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of
11.00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Euro Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include
such a rate or is unavailable on a Euro Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London office of
each of four major banks in the Eurozone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s
offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11.00 a.m., Brussels time, on such
Euro Determination Date, to prime banks in the Eurozone interbank market for deposits in a Euro Representative
Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Euro Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Euro Floating
Rate Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so
provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such
bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11.00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Euro
Determination Date, for loans in a Euro Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a
three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Euro Determination Date.
If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Euro Floating Rate Interest Period will be the arithmetic
mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Euro Floating Rate Interest
Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Euro Floating Rate Interest Period. If,


-----

in any case, that rate determined in accordance with the above is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be
zero.

If the Issuer determines that the EURIBOR rate is no longer being calculated or administered, or it
becomes illegal for the Calculation Agent to determine any amounts due to be paid pursuant to then-existing
EURIBOR, as at the relevant Euro Determination Date, any alternative rate which has replaced EURIBOR in
customary market usage for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated
securities, as identified by the Issuer, in consultation with an Independent Financial Advisor appointed by the
Issuer, and promptly thereafter notified by the Issuer to the Holders and the Calculation Agent, shall, at the option
of the Issuer, be the new rate replacing EURIBOR (the “EURIBOR Successor Rate”) in lieu of the replacement
rate described in the definition of “EURIBOR”; _provided, however, that if the Independent Financial Advisor_
determines that there is no clear market consensus as to whether any rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary
market usage, the Independent Financial Advisor shall determine an appropriate alternative rate (and any
applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any
economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR) to be
the EURIBOR Successor Rate, and the decision of the Independent Financial Advisor will be binding on the
Issuer, the Calculation Agent and the Holders, and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to
each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least two Business Days prior to any Euro
Determination Date, such EURIBOR Successor Rate (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further inquiry, investigation,
verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the
Euro Applicable Floating Rate; provided further that any such alternative rate adopted pursuant to this paragraph
shall in all cases never be less than 0.00%. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the provisions of “—
_Amendments and Waivers,” no consent of Holders will be required in respect of any EURIBOR Successor Rate_
selected pursuant to this paragraph. Following the adoption of the EURIBOR Successor Rate pursuant to this
paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative rate.

“Euro Determination Date” with respect to a Euro Floating Rate Interest Period, means the day that is
two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Euro Floating Rate Interest Period.

“Euro Floating Rate Interest Period” means, with respect to the Floating Rate Euro Notes, the period
commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately
preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Euro Floating Rate Interest
Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include   , 2021.

“Euro Representative Amount” means the greater of (1) € 1.0 million and (2) an amount that is
representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Eurozone” means the region comprising member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other
page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information
vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Euro
Determination Date, determine the Euro Applicable Floating Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest
payable in respect of the following Euro Floating Rate Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest
Amount shall be calculated by applying the Euro Applicable Floating Rate to the principal amount of each Note
outstanding at the commencement of the Euro Floating Rate Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the
actual amounts of days in the Euro Floating Rate Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages
resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or
.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Euro Applicable Floating Rate
and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default or manifest error, be final
and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying
that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law.


-----

Interest on the Fixed Rate Euro Notes will accrue at a rate of    % per annum. Interest on the Fixed Rate
Notes will:

    - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
paid;

    - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each    and   , commencing on   , 2021;

    - be payable to the Holder of record of such Fixed Rate Euro Notes on the Clearing System Business
Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date, or to the extent Definitive Registered
Notes have been issued, to the Holders of record of such Fixed Rate Euro Notes on the Business
Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date, as applicable; and

    - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Interest on the Sterling Notes will accrue at a rate of    % per annum. Interest on the Sterling Notes
will:

    - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
paid;

    - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each    and   , commencing on   , 2021;

    - be payable to the Holder of record of such Sterling Notes on the Clearing System Business Day
immediately preceding the related interest payment date, or to the extent Definitive Registered
Notes have been issued, to the Holders of record of such Sterling Notes on the Business Day
immediately preceding the related interest payment date, as applicable; and

    - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts (as defined below) will accrue
at a rate that is 1% higher than the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Euro Notes or the Sterling Notes, as
applicable.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such
payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result
of any such delay. The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes will be subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is permitted_
to issue additional Notes of the same or different series, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes
except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the
Trustee (“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear
interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or
rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest
shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of
holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;


-----

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the
currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the maturity date, and the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within
which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof
in the case of the Euro Notes or in denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof
in the case of the Sterling Notes, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

In the Issuer’s sole discretion, the aforementioned Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pertaining
to (a) the redemption of such Additional Notes, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to, pursuant to any
special mandatory redemption in the event that the release from any escrow into which proceeds of the issuance
of such Additional Notes are deposited is conditioned on the consummation of any acquisition, Investment,
refinancing or other transaction (such redemption, a “Special Mandatory Redemption”), (b) the escrow of all or a
portion of the proceeds of such Additional Notes and the granting of Liens described in clause (22) of the definition
of “Permitted Liens” in favor of the Trustee or a security agent solely for the benefit of the holders of such
Additional Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of the holders of any other Notes, including
Notes of the same series as such Additional Notes), together with all necessary authorizations for the Trustee or
such security agent to enter into such arrangements provided that, for so long as the proceeds of such Additional
Notes are in escrow, such Additional Notes shall benefit only from such Liens and shall not be subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and shall not benefit from any security interest
in the Collateral. In addition, such Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pursuant to which such Additional
Notes are issued bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common code pending the satisfaction of certain conditions,
such as the consummation of an acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction, and such Additional
Notes bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common code may be automatically exchanged for new Additional
Notes bearing the same CUSIP, ISIN or common code as any existing Notes issued; provided that such Additional
Notes are fungible with the Notes issued on the relevant issue date for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as any other series of Notes, including the Notes
initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such
other series, and shall be deemed to form one series with other series (including, if applicable, such Notes) (it
being understood that any Additional Notes that are substantially identical in all material respects to any other
series of Notes but for being subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption shall be deemed to be substantially
identical to such series of Notes only following the expiration of any provisions relating to such Special Mandatory
Redemption). All series of Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the
purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for any applicable series; _provided, that any Additional Notes that are not fungible with the_
applicable series of Notes initially offered hereunder for U.S. federal income tax purposes will have a separate
ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number from such Notes. Unless the context
otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes”
shall be deemed to include references to the Floating Rate Euro Notes, the Fixed Rate Euro Notes and the Sterling
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to
be of the same series as any other series of Notes, including the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only
if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such other series, and shall be deemed to form
one series with such other series (including, if applicable, such Notes) (it being understood that any Additional
Notes that are substantially identical in all material respects to any other series of Notes but for being subject to a
Special Mandatory Redemption shall be deemed to be substantially identical to such series of Notes only following
the expiration of any provisions relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption).

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below)
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and
Clearstream).


-----

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any Definitive Registered Notes
will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes in
the City of London. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the
Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes
for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in the City of London (including the
initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”).
The initial Registrar will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch and the initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank, N.A.,
London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time
to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.
A register of the Notes shall be maintained at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between
the register of the Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register
kept by the Registrar shall prevail.

If Definitive Registered Notes are in circulation and there is a discrepancy between the register of the
Registrar and the register of the Issuer, on consultation between the Issuer and the Registrar, the Issuer will amend
the register to reflect the register of the Registrar.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar, Calculation Agent or Transfer Agent for the Notes
without prior notice to the Holders of the Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or
Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons,
as follows:

    - each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global
Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

    - each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition,
transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected
by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification


-----

(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting
the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction._

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become
a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 or £100,000 principal amount, as applicable, and integral multiples of €1,000 or £1,000, as applicable,
in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and
other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions
received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry
Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the
Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have
a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 or £100,000 in principal
amount, as applicable, and integral multiples of €1,000 or £1,000, as applicable, in excess thereof. In connection
with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among
other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the
account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will
be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Notes
to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat
the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, subject to the terms of the Security Documents and the Agreed Security
Principles, the Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests ranking _pari passu with the security_
interests securing the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (collectively, the “Super Senior
_Obligations”) (subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement) over:_

    - the share capital of the Issuer held by the Parent, the share capital of Simon Holdco and Lowell
Holding GmbH held by the Issuer and the share capital of Lowell Holdco GmbH held by Lowell
Holding GmbH;

    - the T-Shares of the Issuer and the Guarantors (except the Parent) held by New Luxco;

    - intercompany loan receivables of Lowell Holding GmbH, the Issuer and the Parent;


-----

    - bank accounts of the Issuer and Lowell Holding GmbH;

    - substantially all assets of Simon Holdco, Simon Midco, Simon Bidco, Metis Bidco Limited,
Lowell Financial Ltd, Lowell Portfolio I Ltd, Lowell Solicitors Limited, Hansa Holdco Limited,
Lowell Nordics Oy and Fredrickson International Limited;

    - certain of the share capital and/or intragroup receivables of Lowell Holdco GmbH, Proceed
Collection Services GmbH, Sirius Inkasso GmbH, GFKL Collections GmbH, IBW
Verwaltungs- und Beteiligungs GmbH, INKASSO BECKER WUPPERTAL GmbH & Co. KG,
Lowell Sverige AB, Lowell Danmark A/S, Lowell Finans A/S, Lowell AS and Lowell Suomi Oy;
and

    - Lowell Holding GmbH’s rights under the agreement in respect of the GFKL Acquisition, Lowell
Holdco GmbH’s rights under the 2016 Acquisition Agreement and Lowell Nordics Oy’s rights
under the 2017 Acquisition Agreement.

As described above, the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain Hedging Obligations and may also secure certain future Indebtedness, including Additional Notes. The
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
Holders of the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this issuance of Notes.
By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights
and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles,
including (but not limited to) if:

    - the security interest to be granted is (i) by a member of the Group incorporated, organized or
established under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, (ii) over any asset located in the
Federal Republic of Germany governed, and/or (iii) under security document governed by the laws
of the Federal Republic of Germany and would create security interests other than with respect to
the intragroup receivables of, and the shares held by members of the Group in, the relevant entity;

    - providing such security or guarantee would be prohibited by general legal and statutory
limitations, such as regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital
maintenance, fraudulent preference, “interest stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” transfer
pricing or “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims and similar
principles; provided that the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, shall use
commercially reasonable endeavors to overcome any such limitation;

    - providing such security or guarantee would require the consent of a supervisory board, works
council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external body or person, unless
such consent has been received; provided that reasonable endeavors have been used by the Issuer
or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, to obtain the relevant consent;

    - (subject to certain exceptions) the cost of providing such security or guarantee (including adverse
effects on taxes, interest deductibility and stamp duty, notarization and registration fees) is
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders;

    - the assets are subject to third-party arrangements which may prevent those assets from being
secured (or are assets which, if secured, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise
amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of either the Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of those assets or require such entity to take any action materially adverse
to the interests of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or any member thereof); provided that
reasonable endeavors to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, in certain circumstances;

    - providing such security or guarantee would not be within the legal capacity of the Issuer or
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or if the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties of those
directors or contravene any legal prohibition, bona fide contractual restriction or regulatory


-----

condition or would, despite market standard limitation language, result in (or in a material risk of)
personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer; provided that the Issuer or relevant
Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, shall use reasonable endeavors to overcome any such
obstacle;

    - providing such security or guarantee would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant security provider to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course (as
otherwise permitted by the relevant finance documents); and

    - the assets are those of any joint venture or similar arrangement or any minority interest.

For further information regarding limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses
generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law,
see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility; (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations; (c) the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture; and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness
permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility and such Hedging
Obligations which provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain
Hedging Obligations and the Notes are secured equally and ratably by first priority Security Interests. However,
under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes will only receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral after certain super senior priority obligations including (i) obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) certain priority Hedging Obligations have been paid in full. In addition, pursuant
to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the
Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement,” “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and_
“—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Parent, the Issuer, New Luxco and certain of the Guarantors have
granted, or will grant, security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due on the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security
Documents have been, or will be, entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent
for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent has acted in its own name,
but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the holders of Notes from time to time).
Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as security agent for the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain Hedging Obligations.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable
laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and
the holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the
Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in
respect of the enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests
in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture have been discharged.
However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”


-----

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents.

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Parent, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain
in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and
assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all
dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that
is part of the Collateral).

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce
the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in
certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedge
counterparties. The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future
Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured
by the Collateral have (i) appointed the Security Agent to act as their respective agent under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents and
(ii) authorized the Security Agent to (A) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that
are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such
Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions and (B) execute each security
document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent on its behalf.

Upon accession to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee, by accepting a Note, and each Holder of
Notes, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to have, (i) appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security
Documents and (ii) authorized the Security Agent to (A) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing
such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (B) execute each security
document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and
that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the Holders of the Notes) to enter
into the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed
to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and
comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”_


-----

**_Release of Liens_**

New Luxco, the Parent, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will be entitled to release the Security Interests in
respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) other than the existing Security Interests in respect of shares of Capital Stock of the Issuer, in
connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such
sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales
_of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or (b) any Restricted_
Subsidiary; _provided, that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon unless, subject to the Agreed Security_
Principles, the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of
the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal

(7) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include

_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”;_

with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest.”_

The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action reasonably requested in writing by the
Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Security Document subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth

_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, any series of or all of the Notes, if
holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or series of Notes
validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes or series of Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or
any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes or series of Notes validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn by such holders, all of the holders will be deemed to have consented to such
tender offer and, accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes or series of Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other holder in such tender offer, plus, to the
extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the
date of such redemption.

_Optional Redemption and Satisfaction and Discharge_

If the Issuer elects to redeem any series of the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a
satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of the Indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—
_Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” requests that the Trustee distribute to the Holders amounts_
deposited in trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued and unpaid interest to


-----

the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the applicable redemption notice will state
that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (i) on or promptly after the date fixed
for redemption or (ii) on such earlier payment date as selected by the Issuer.

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice
of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice.”

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any
such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

**_Sinking Fund_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of any series of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
will select the Floating Rate Euro Notes, Fixed Rate Euro Notes or Sterling Notes, as the case may be, for
redemption on a pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Clearstream or Euroclear (as applicable),
unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements; provided, however,
that no Euro Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and no Sterling
Note of £100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Euro Notes in integral
multiples of €1,000 and only Sterling Notes in integral multiples of £1,000, as applicable, will be redeemed.
Neither the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this
paragraph.

On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or the part of the Notes called
for redemption. If any series of Notes is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
series of Notes shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive
Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any
Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such
Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.
Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the
related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall
such date of redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent,
except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is
issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture), or such
redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the notice requirements in the Indenture will be subject to the
applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream for so long as the Notes are held as Global Notes. To
the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream conflict with any requirements
applicable to notices under the Indenture, a notice will be deemed to satisfy such requirements if it complies with
the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream concerning the content, timing and procedure for
delivering notices and otherwise complies with any applicable requirements under the Indenture.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem any series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders of the relevant series of Notes with a copy to


-----

the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a
“Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding
_Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption_
or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation
of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the
next interest payment date in respect of such series of Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to such series of Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement
cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable,
but not including changing the jurisdiction of the Issuer). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced
and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply
(a) to a Guarantor only at or after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the
relevant series of Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or delivery of any notice of redemption of any series of Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem
have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable
measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been
or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept
and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding
on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each,
a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction
of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed
or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made by or on behalf of
the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be made from
any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, as applicable,
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with
such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net


-----

amounts received by the Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any
such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would
have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee, as applicable, in the absence
of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on
account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant
Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen
or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction), including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes that are
required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005, as amended, but
excluding, in each case, any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any
payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture, a Note Guarantee, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or a Security Document;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request by the Payor addressed to the Holder, after
reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide
certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice
of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction of,
all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such
certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation
of the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required)
more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the
extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last
day of such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under
or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Tax, assessment
or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed or withheld pursuant to
sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof,
or any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler
with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner directly held such Notes.

Each Holder entitled to any Additional Amounts shall cooperate with the Issuer and the Trustee in
providing any information or documentation reasonably requested by the Issuer or the Trustee to confirm the
identity and/or tax status of such Holder and any affected beneficial owner to the extent such information is readily
available to the Holder (to the extent necessary to establish such Holder’s entitlement to Additional Amounts) and
to provide reasonable assistance to the Issuer or Trustee in determining the applicable withholding tax rate and
the amount of Additional Amounts payable in respect thereof.


-----

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable
evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available
to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated
to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to
Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days
prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as
practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof
that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court
or documentary Taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto)
or any other excise, property or similar Taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture,
the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in
connection with a transfer of the Notes after this issuance of Notes and limited solely in the case of taxes
attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6) or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply _mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any_
successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for Tax purposes or otherwise resident for Tax purposes,
or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee)
is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this
heading “Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part
(equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Euro Notes and £100,000
or integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Sterling Notes, if applicable; provided that Euro
Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part and Sterling Notes of £100,000 or less
may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase
any series of Notes as described under this heading, “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has
unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series and given notice of redemption as
described under “—Optional Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived.


-----

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of a series of Notes and given
notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the
Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such
Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record
date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease
to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and
that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event,
stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering
Event.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred,
the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its
election, who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender
has been accepted by the Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank
account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding
amount of such Notes from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon
the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer
or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of
Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a
definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is
made.


-----

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this
covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited
by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control or Change of
Control Triggering Event would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender
under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that
would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control
or Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer
to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.
Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then
existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified
other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event has
occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders
of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence, after giving pro forma effect
to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and (2) to
the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 3.75 to 1.0; provided, that the
amount of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the foregoing does not cause the Non-Guarantor Debt Cap to be
exceeded.

(“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility

Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to the Notes or such Note Guarantee to the same extent
as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or (b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness_
of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the
terms of the Indenture;

(4) Indebtedness (i) of any Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a

(ii) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate a transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition or other
transaction and after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence
of Indebtedness, either (x) the Issuer would have been able to Incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or
other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness;

disposition); provided that, in connection with a disposition, the maximum liability of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair

changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such
disposition;

of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (provided that such
Incurrence shall be deemed to correspondingly reduce such Restricted Payments capacity); and

(15) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of joint ventures in a
maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding the greater of £135 million and 5.0%
of Total Assets.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and
may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, other than Indebtedness which will continue to be
secured on the Collateral and which benefits from super senior priority status pursuant to clause (b)(iii) of the
definition of Permitted Collateral Liens, and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness
in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date shall be
deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph of
this covenant;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a
particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11),
(13) or (14) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) “ERC” in relation to clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant shall be measured at
the option of the Issuer on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained or the date on which
new Indebtedness is Incurred and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to
such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will
be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the second paragraph of this covenant measured
by reference to a percentage of ERC or Total Assets at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the
percentage of ERC or Total Assets restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of ERC or
Total Assets on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of ERC or Total Assets restriction shall not be
deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance,
costs and fees in connection with such refinancing.


-----

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of
any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness
issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of
any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is
not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant)._

For purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterling-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the pound sterling equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated
in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields
the lower pound sterling equivalent, as applicable), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a
currency other than pound sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable pound sterling-denominated
restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing, such pound sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the
definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the pound sterling equivalent of the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to
a Currency Agreement (with respect to the pound sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in pound sterling will be adjusted to take into account
the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall
be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the
Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:

Disqualified Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the Issuer or
in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the
case of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders of its Capital
Stock other than the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro rata basis, measured
by value);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any
direct or indirect Parent Holdco of the Issuer held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
(other than in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire

other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or
final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other than any
payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition,
retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to herein as a “Restricted
_Payment”), if at the time the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:_

(a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result
immediately thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1)

made or deemed to be made subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including (i)
Permitted Payments permitted below by clauses (5), (10) or (17) of the second succeeding paragraph,
but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph, and (ii) the
aggregate principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred or deemed to be Incurred pursuant to
clause (15) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”)
would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting
period) from October 1, 2020 to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date
of such Restricted Payment for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer
are available (or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such
deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as

the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary subsequent to the Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or
exchanged for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated

Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the
fair market value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property
or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary upon such
conversion or exchange); but excluding (w) Disqualified Stock or Indebtedness issued or sold

any property or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
respect of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, excluding the amount
of any Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary that constituted a Permitted Investment made

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be
the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by an officer of the Issuer.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

exercise of a conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional
shares) for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale or issuance (other than to a Subsidiary of
the Issuer) of, Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares),
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (other than through the
issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or through an Excluded Contribution, a Parent

Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the preceding
paragraph;

_Indebtedness” above;_

(3) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition, cancellation or
retirement of Preferred Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary made by exchange for or out of the proceeds

-----

that, in each case, is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” above, and that in each case, constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness;_

(4) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of
Subordinated Indebtedness: (a) from Net Available Cash to the extent permitted under “—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” but only (i) if the Issuer shall have first complied with the terms described under_

of, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred in accordance with the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”;_

(20) any dividends, distributions or other payments to any Parent HoldCo or Unrestricted Subsidiary
to the extent that such dividends, distributions or payments are made in order to carry out group contributions
under the tax laws or regulations of an applicable jurisdiction up to an amount not to exceed with respect to such
Taxes the amount of any such Taxes that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been required to
pay on a separate company basis or on a consolidated basis if the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries had paid
tax on a consolidated, combined, group, affiliates or unitary basis on behalf of an affiliate group consisting only
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and

(21) Restricted Payments made in connection with and to effect the Transactions.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such

Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall
be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) (i) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in the
first paragraph of this covenant, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the third paragraph of this covenant and/or
(iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on
the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur
or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary),
whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits
therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any
property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are
not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of Guarantors) are
directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (but without regard to any Agreed Security Principles
limiting the types of assets that may be pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees under the Indenture),
equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of
any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”


-----

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay
any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving
Credit Facility) and any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date
or (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or any related security
documents;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating
to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness
Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction
or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired
by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for
the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Company (as defined under “—Merger and
_Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall_
be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews,
refinances or replaces any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or
this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an
agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); _provided, however, that the_
encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances
and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment,
supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of
the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets
subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or


-----

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property
so acquired in the nature of clause (c) of the preceding paragraph, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to
a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of
the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or
assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of
all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are
subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements
and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses, concessions,
franchises or permits, including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits (including assets in escrow
accounts) paid on property;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or
suppliers, or as required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities, in each case, under agreements
or policies entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements or Interest Rate Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to
any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such
agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility, together with the security documents
associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is
customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Issuer) or (B) the Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest
payments on the Notes or (b) that constitutes an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such
Qualified Receivables Financing; or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on
_Liens.”_

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is
not less than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Issuer); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of
such Asset Disposition consists of:

(a) cash (including any net cash proceeds received from the conversion, within 180 days
of such Asset Disposition, of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;


-----

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities of the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries recorded on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since
the date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer and each other Restricted
Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(d) Replacement Assets;

(e) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second
paragraph of this covenant;

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from
Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness
(i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to exceed the
greater of £200 million and 7.4% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated
Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (g) of this
clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of
the Asset Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition
and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof; (ii) unless included in the preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem the Floating
Rate Euro Notes, the Fixed Rate Euro Notes, the Sterling Notes, any other series of Notes and/or any other
Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes; or (iii) prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that
is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness
of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase any series of Notes by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Notes
(in accordance with the procedures set forth below);

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business,
if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or
useful in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3),
(4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be treated as
a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the


-----

date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess
_Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce_
revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by
the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366[th] day (or on the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used
pursuant to a binding agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent pursuant to
clause (8) of the second preceding paragraph) after an Asset Disposition or such earlier time if the Issuer elects,
if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds £75 million, the Issuer will be required within 30 Business
Days thereof to make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to
all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu
basis with the Notes, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness
to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price
in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price
of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including,
the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing
such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable) in the case of Euro Notes or in minimum denominations of £100,000 and
in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable) in the case of Sterling Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by
Holders and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes
and such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
not denominated in pounds sterling, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal
amounts into their pound sterling equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset
Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

Any Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes pursuant to this covenant will be allocated
between the Floating Rate Euro Notes, the Fixed Rate Euro Notes, the Sterling Notes and any other series of Notes
in proportion to the pound sterling equivalent aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Euro Notes, Fixed Rate
Euro Notes, Sterling Notes and such other series of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase
_Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness_
required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the
Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of € 100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable) in the case of the Euro Notes, or in minimum denominations
of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable), in the case of the Sterling Notes.


-----

The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were
accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Paying Agent shall deliver
to the Holders of Notes the purchase price of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn and arrange for the
deduction of the appropriate amounts of Notes from such Holders’ accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream (as
applicable). Any Note not so accepted will be promptly delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to
the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the
Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this
covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of
any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of
related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of £20 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction on an arm’s-length basis at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £35 million, the
terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of
the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with

Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time
from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted

acquisitions or divestitures, which payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of this
clause (11) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(12) any transactions for which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers a written letter or
opinion to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have
been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an
Affiliate;

(13) pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(14) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(15) any participation in a public tender or exchange offer for securities or debt instruments issued
by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries that are conducted on arm’s-length terms and provide for the same price or
exchange ratio, as the case may be, to all holders accepting such tender or exchange offer.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will make available to Holders the following reports in
the manner described below:


-----

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Parent’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2020, annual reports containing: (i) an operating and financial discussion of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations, and a discussion of liquidity
and capital resources, material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies of the Parent;
(ii) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Parent, together with explanatory footnotes,
for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been
provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); _provided that such_ _pro forma financial_
information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer
will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Parent as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate
footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years, and the report of the independent
auditors on the financial statements; (iv) a description of the management and shareholders of the Parent, all
material affiliate transactions and a description of all material debt instruments; (v) a description of material
changes to risk factors and of material subsequent events (to the extent not provided in a previous report pursuant
to clause (2) or (3) below); (vi) ERC calculated on an 84-month and a 120-month basis, gross collections, adjusted
EBITDA, ERC for the year’s vintage, gross money multiple for the year’s vintage and purchases for the year; and
(vii) a description of the material differences in the financial condition and results of operations between the Issuer
and the Parent; _provided that the information described in clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) may be provided in the_
footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of
the Parent, beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2020, unaudited quarterly financial statements
containing the following information: (i) the Parent’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the
end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter
year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period,
together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of
the Parent, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that
have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report
relates (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without
unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financials); (iii) an operating and financial discussion of the unaudited financial statements, including a
discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, ERC calculated on an 84-month and a
120-month basis, gross collections, adjusted EBITDA, purchases for the period, and material changes in liquidity
and capital resources of the Parent; (iv) a discussion of material changes in material debt instruments since the
most recent report; (v) material subsequent events and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the
most recent annual report; and (vi) a description of the material differences in the financial condition and results
of operations between the Issuer and the Parent; _provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and_
(v) may be provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Parent announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Parent or a change
in auditors of the Parent, a report containing a description of such event.

The Issuer shall have the option at any time to provide the reports set forth in (1) and (2) above as if each
reference to the “Parent” had been to the “Issuer,” in which case subsections (1)(vii) and (2)(vi) shall not apply.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long
as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the
Securities Act.

The Issuer shall make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of the reports set
forth in (1), (2) and (3) above by posting them on the Issuer’s website or, if the Issuer is unable to post the reports
on its website for any reason, by providing them to the Trustee. All financial statement information shall be
prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on
the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise
be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above
may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report


-----

need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer. In addition, the reports set forth
above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. At any
time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a
group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the
quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include
a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the
financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required
by Section 13(a) with the SEC, or (ii) the Issuer elects to post on its website reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as
to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to Holders such annual
reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC
pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity or the listing of such Capital
Stock on an internationally recognized stock exchange, the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be
considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock
exchange; provided that the IPO Entity shall provide financial reporting for the first three fiscal quarters in each
fiscal year and an annual report; provided further that if the consolidated financial statements of the IPO Entity
are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the consolidated
financial statements of the IPO Entity and the Issuer shall be included for any period after the Issue Date.

Delivery of information, documents and reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only. The
Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein,
including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture or documents related therein.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the
European Union, the United Kingdom, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly
assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer
under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as
applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction),
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor
Company would be able to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio for the Issuer or the Successor Company for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would
not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and


-----

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any is required
in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding
agreement enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee); _provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s_
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Without prejudice to clause (3) in the immediately preceding paragraph, any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted
Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance
with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred
in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of a Person.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the
surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as
an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor
or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under
its Note Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and
delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Guarantor
under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, as applicable; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

_provided,_ _however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall not apply to the extent that_
compliance with clauses (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of


-----

any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring
all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the
Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation,
the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and clauses (1) and (4) under
the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; or (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into
or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile
of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity;
_provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (A) and (B) under_
the heading “—The Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction. The Indenture will
provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed, with respect to the Notes it holds,
not to exercise, and thereby waives in advance, its right in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act (Fin:
Osakeyhtiölaki 624/2006, as amended) to object any such merger that is otherwise permitted in this “Merger and
Consolidation” covenant.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
_Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:_

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”; and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable
to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
Reversion Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly
taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will
constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as
if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On
the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to
have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture will also
permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor
any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an
Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event
and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the
Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption have been satisfied;
_provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this_


-----

caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment
Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

New Luxco, the Issuer and the Parent shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the
Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the paragraph below, that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security
Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and New Luxco, the Issuer
and the Parent shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other
than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) New Luxco, the Issuer, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the
Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; (iii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity,
mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein; (iv) New Luxco, the Issuer, the Parent and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with respect to the Collateral in connection
with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization and (v) the Security Interests, and the related Security
Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); _provided,_
_however, that in the case of clauses (i) and (v) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended,_
renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced; unless, contemporaneously with any
such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as applicable) or of New
Luxco, and of the person granting such Security Interest, in each case, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
(2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification
or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, as so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are valid Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of
this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent
being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions
from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility, any Credit Facility or any other Public Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such
Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such Guarantee is Incurred and, if
applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture
pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee; _provided, however, that such_
Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the
Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in:
(1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference,
thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or
regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners
of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent


-----

reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Releases
_of the Note Guarantees.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer_
if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the
Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not
been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee
and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer or the Parent, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness
referred to in the foregoing clause (1), New Luxco, the Parent, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially
the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests;
_provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or_
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement,
(2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including, with respect to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes),
(5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely
affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled
to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and
_Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the_
extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the
opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities
under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders
to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any
obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of


-----

the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the offices of the Issuer.

to the provision of such services;

(2) (a) the Incurrence of any Indebtedness or Subordinated Shareholder Funding permitted under

activities and entering into transactions related or incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of Simon
Holdco’s, the Issuer’s and the Issuer’s Subsidiaries’ corporate existence and any other transaction of a type
customarily entered into by holding companies and their subsidiaries (including the payment of wages, Taxes and
the incurrence of obligations and liabilities arising by operation of law or that are typical or incidental to the
activities of a holding company);

(6) any activity reasonably relating to the servicing, purchase, redemption, amendment, exchange,
refinancing or retirement of the Notes or other Indebtedness (or other items that are specifically excluded from
the definition of Indebtedness) not prohibited to be Incurred under the Indenture;

(7) the entering into and performance of any rights or obligations in respect of (i) contracts and
agreements with its officers, directors, employees, consultants and other providers of goods and services;
(ii) subscription or purchase agreements for securities or preferred equity certificates, public offering rights
agreements, voting and other shareholder agreements, engagement letters, underwriting agreements, agreements
with Rating Agencies and other agreements in respect of its securities or any offering, issuance or sale thereof;

-----

**Listing**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain the listing of the Notes on a
“recognised stock exchange” as defined in section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom as
promptly as practicable after the Issue Date and (ii) maintain such listing and admission to trading for so long as
such Notes are outstanding; provided that if maintenance of such listing becomes unduly onerous, it will, prior to
delisting the Notes, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain listing of such Notes on another
“recognised stock exchange.”

**Financial Calculations**

When calculating the availability or permission under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each
case in connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment, Change of Control or any
other similar transaction where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence
(including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness, Liens, Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the
date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the
Issuer, be (A) the date the definitive agreements for such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture,
Investment, Change of Control or any such similar transaction are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be
calculated on a _pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture,_
Investment, Change of Control or such similar transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they
occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate
any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio) or (B) the date of
consummation of any such transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are
determined to be in compliance under (A) above and are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or
ratio (including due to fluctuations in ERC or pro forma ERC, Consolidated EBITDA or pro forma Consolidated
EBITDA or Total Assets or pro forma Total Assets) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to
the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as
a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transactions are permitted hereunder
and (y) if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement,
any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed
to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes
of calculating any baskets or ratios under this Indenture (except to the extent such transaction is subsequently
abandoned); provided, that Consolidated Net Income (and any other financial term derived therefrom), other than
for purposes of calculating any ratios in connection with such merger, acquisition or other Investment, shall not
include any Consolidated Net Income of or attributable to the target company or assets associated with any such
merger, acquisition or Investment unless and until the closing of such merger, acquisition or Investment shall have
actually occurred.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under
the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by New Luxco (only with respect to the covenants under the headings “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests” and “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor_
_Agreements”), the Issuer, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee_
or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained
in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries),
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee
now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:


-----

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates £75 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Parent, the Issuer or a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Issuer or the Parent), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy
_provisions”);_

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer or the Parent), would constitute
a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of £75 million (exclusive of any amounts
for which a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability), which judgments are not paid, discharged or
stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a fair
market value in excess of £30 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest
created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default continues
for 10 days; and

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than
in accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in
a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and
any such Default continues for 10 days.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes under the Indenture, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the
request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the
Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued
and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes
because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under the definition of “—Events of Default” has occurred
and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default
or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived
by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment
of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the
Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except
as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to
the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with


-----

respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment
or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right
to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee
to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holder has offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request
and the offer of such security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to
use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however,
may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking
any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or other security satisfactory to it
in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to
the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer
with the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is
informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of,
or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred
during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and
what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default
for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate
pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report
required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, prior to acceleration, even though such delivery
is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the
Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be
unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action
directly.


-----

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in euro equivalent principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);
_provided that, if any amendment, supplement, other modification or waiver will only amend, supplement or waive_
one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
of such series shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then
outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes
held by a non-consenting Holder or, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, supplement,
modify or waive one series of the Senior Secured Notes, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90%
of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes affected, with respect to any such series
of Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with
respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer agrees to pay Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in
the Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note
Guarantees or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;
or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document;


-----

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders
or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect
under the Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation on Additional
_Guarantees,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes,_
or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien (including
the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture,
the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of
this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended
to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or security agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security
interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by
the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of the
Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any
Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to
any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such
Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of any series
of Notes have taken any action under the Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes will
be deemed to be the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes as of (i) the record date in
respect of such action (if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action) or (ii) the date the
taking of such action by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of such Notes has been certified to
the Trustee by the Issuer (if no such record date has been set).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clause (3) above to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the
supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and
executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted
by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer and the Trustee.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or


-----

controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding; provided that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes
and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate
(other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Restricted Subsidiaries’ obligations under the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants_
described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross
acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to any Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment
default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “—Events of
_Default” (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its
covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the
Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash_
in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of the Euro
Notes) or pound sterling or pound sterling-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof (in the case of Sterling Notes) sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the
Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including
delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance
only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling received by the Issuer from, or
published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject
to customary assumptions and qualifications), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating
to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute,
or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection
with either defeasance option.


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for
in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the
Trustee for this purpose), cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof (in the case of the Euro Notes) or cash in pound sterling or pound sterling-denominated European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of Sterling Notes), as applicable, in an amount
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent
for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have
become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid
or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at
maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be (subject to the next succeeding sentence) and (5) the Issuer
has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may
not be an employee of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the
“Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of
fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested by the Issuer in writing
to the Trustee and Principal Paying Agent (which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption
or pursuant to the above referenced Officer’s Certificate) no later than 5 business days prior to such distribution,
the Trustee shall distribute any amount deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or the
redemption date, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to holders prior to
the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment,
break cost or any additional premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a global note
deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a
participant of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, any Guarantor or New Luxco, if
applicable, under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations
or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under
the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Citibank, N.A., London Branch is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as
are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person
would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of
the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a


-----

majority in principal amount of then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
Issuer, and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the
Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for
removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee. Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall
not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes
(other than net-income taxes) or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer, the Guarantors and New Luxco, if applicable, for the payment of principal, or
premium, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims
against the Issuer, any Guarantor or New Luxco, if applicable, for the payment of interest on the Notes will be
prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro or Pound Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro and pound sterling are the sole currencies of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer
and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes and the related Note
Guarantees, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro (with respect to
the Euro Notes) or pound sterling (with respect to the Sterling Notes), whether as a result of, or the enforcement
of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor
or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro
or pound sterling amount (as applicable) which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or
recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that
purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro or pound sterling amount is less than the euro or pound sterling amount expressed to be due
to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss
sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify
the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the
Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources
of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee
(other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other
judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note
Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro
or pound sterling-denominated restriction herein, the euro or pound sterling equivalent amount, as applicable, for
purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency other than euro or pound sterling, as applicable, shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro or non-pound sterling
amount, as applicable, is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with respect
to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any
purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing—Each Note Guarantee and security interest will be subject to_
_certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit its validity and enforceability” and “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note_
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and
state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of articles 470- 3 to 470-19 of the Luxembourg act dated
10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Luxembourg Companies Act 1915”), are excluded.
No Holder may initiate proceedings against the Issuer based on article 470-21 of the Luxembourg Companies Act

guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness subsequent to the
commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior

anticipated expense and cost reductions and other run rate synergies, to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee,
repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds

to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”

responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer and may include anticipated expense and cost
reductions and other run rate synergies) as if they had occurred on the first day of the reference period;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business
or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be
excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into
account anticipated cost savings resulting from any such disposal, as determined in good faith by a
responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and
ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a Restricted
Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period
(taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any Indebtedness
is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation of
Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS.

proceeds of Indebtedness in respect of which the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
is to be made).

“Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (x) the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage at such date to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA for

**General**

The Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A
Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together
with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities
accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, the Notes will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain
states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those
securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge BookEntry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the
Notes registered in their name, will not have received physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will
not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees),
as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.
Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must
rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or their agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for
any aspect of the records, or for payments made, relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction
of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only
in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants
has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents or waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event
of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserves
the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive
**Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.**

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes:

1. if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

2. if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture.


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry
Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer
issues or causes to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only
to the owner who made the initial request.

In such an event described in clauses (1) and (2), the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes,
registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear,
Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not
required by the Indenture or applicable law.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the
Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, Trustee or Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any
loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for expenses
in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem
or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation
Agent, the Security Agent and the Paying Agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note
as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of
the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Registrar,
and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or
their respective nominees, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion
thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all
of its Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants’ accounts on
a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 or £100,000, as applicable,
principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the relevant Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will,
in turn make said payments to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear
and/or Clearstream will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective customary
procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except
as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any such
deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts_


-----

received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding
to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note
or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing
customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry
Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer
Agent, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (for
example, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent,
the Calculation Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent or any of their respective agents
has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the relevant
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires
physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which
require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its
interests in the relevant Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A BookEntry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule
144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the closing
of the Offering (the “40-day Period”), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is a Qualified Purchaser as defined under the U.S. Investment Company Act
who is also a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest without compliance with these
certification requirements.


-----

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of
the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfers,” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers
to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest
in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests
in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement
system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations
or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream
hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants.
Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial
institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes
only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
The Notes have been accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream. The international
securities identification numbers and common code numbers for the Notes are set out under “Listing and General
_Information—Clearing Information.” Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear_
or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Calculation Agent,
the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream
or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.


-----

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro and pound sterling, as applicable, Book-Entry
Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of
the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.


-----

**TAXATION**

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and
disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that
may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or
circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany
currently in force and as applied on the date of this Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly
with retroactive or retrospective effect.

The law as currently in effect provides for a reduced tax rate for certain investment income. There is an
on-going discussion in Germany whether the reduced tax rate should be increased or abolished altogether so that
investment income would be taxed at regular rates. It is still unclear, whether, how and when the current discussion
may result in any legislative changes.

**_PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX_**
**_ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSAL_**
**_OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR CHURCH TAXES, UNDER_**
**_THE TAX LAWS OF GERMANY AND ANY COUNTRY OF WHICH THEY ARE RESIDENT OR WHOSE_**
**_TAX LAWS APPLY TO THEM FOR OTHER REASONS._**

**_Withholding Tax_**

For German tax residents (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of
effective management and control is located in Germany), interest payments will be subject to German
withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are held in custody with or administered by or presented for an
over-the-counter-payment to a German branch of a German or non-German bank or financial services institution,
a German securities trading company or a German securities trading bank (each, a “Disbursing Agent,”
_auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total_
withholding being 26.375%). For individual holders of Notes subject to church tax, an electronic information
system for church withholding tax purposes applies, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the
Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the
German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the holders will be assessed to
church tax.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest,”
_Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period_
provided that the Notes have been held in a custodial account or administered with the same Disbursing Agent
since the time of their acquisition. Where Notes are acquired and/or sold or redeemed in a currency other than
Euro, the sales/redemption price and the acquisition costs have to be converted into Euro on the basis of the foreign
exchange rates prevailing on the sale or redemption date and the acquisition date respectively with the result that
any currency gains or losses are part of the capital gains. If interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without
the Notes), the proceeds from the disposal are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the
payment of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same
Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding
being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any),
unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes
by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European
Union, the European Economic Area or certain other countries, e.g., in the countries/territories Swiss
Confederation, Principality of Liechtenstein, Republic of San Marino, Principality of Monaco, Principality of
Andorra, Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain),
a German tax resident individual holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal
proceeds must, also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs.


-----

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent generally deducts from the basis of the
withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing
Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other capital investments with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent
also deducts Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective
security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing
Agent credits foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by
the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing
Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene
_Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross_
payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has
submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by
the competent tax authorities.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German resident (including via a commercial partnership,
as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation
has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest
payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The
same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership)
subject to further requirements being met.

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income
and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as
outlined below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are
held in a custodial account with, with, are administered by or presented for an over-the-counter payment to a
Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be
refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in
Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident
in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and
church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen).
Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer_Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership_
law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher
expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under “—
_Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept_
in custody abroad or of no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process. If the withholding tax on
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather
than from the actual gain), the individual holder may and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal
proceeds must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax return and will
then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further,
an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax
rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction
of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to
the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following
assessment periods.


-----

Pursuant to recent legislative changes, losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver
of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party or from any other
default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of EUR 10,000
per year. Where Notes form part of a trade or business, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or
corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity
surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including
Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include
income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s
applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or
corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax
liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from
the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax
(Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz)
applicable to the investor. If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may
generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit
method.

_Non-Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e.,
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not
located in Germany).

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in Germany are generally not subject to
German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including
a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise
constitutes German source income.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift
tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident or deemed
to be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of
Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied unless the Notes are
attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent
representative has been appointed in Germany. Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German citizens who
previously maintained a residence in Germany.

**_Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge_**

According to a bill enacted in December 2019, the solidarity surcharge will be partially abolished as of
the assessment period 2021 for certain individuals. The solidarity surcharge shall, however, continue to apply for
capital investment and, thus, on withholding taxes levied. In case the individual income tax burden for an
individual holder is lower than 25% the holder can apply for his/her capital investment income being assessed at
his/her individual tariff-based income tax rate in which case solidarity surcharge would be refunded.

**_Proposed Abolishment of German Flat Tax on Interest Income_**

The coalition agreement between the German Christian Democratic Party and the German Social
Democratic Party dated March 12, 2018 provides that the current flat taxation (Abgeltungsteuer) of 25% (plus
solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable)
shall be partially abolished, in particular with respect to interest income. As a result, interest on the Notes could
become subject to a taxation at a respective Note holder’s individual personal tax rate (where such noteholder is
a tax resident of Germany) up to a tax rate of 45% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total
withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable).

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes. Currently, net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

The following information is of a general nature only and is based on the laws presently in force in
Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. The information
contained within this section is limited to certain Luxembourg tax issues and prospective investors in the Notes
should therefore consult their own professional advisers as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including
Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a withholding tax or a
tax of a similar nature, or to any other concepts, refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only.

Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt
_sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge_
(contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu) generally. Investors
may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate
income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers
resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and
the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the
management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Withholding tax_**

_Non-Resident Note holders_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, interest payments (including accrued but unpaid
interest) and principal made to non-residents of Luxembourg in the context of the holding, disposal, redemption
or repurchase of the Notes which are not profit-sharing will not be subject to any Luxembourg withholding tax.

_Resident Note holders_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the law of 23 December 2005, as
amended (the “Relibi Law”), there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to
Luxembourg resident holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of Notes, nor is any
Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg resident
holders of Notes provided that the interest on the Notes does not depend on the profit of the Issuer.

Under the Relibi Law, payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent
established in Luxembourg to or for the immediate benefit of an individual beneficial owner who is a resident of
Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Payments of interest under the Notes coming within the
scope of the Relibi Law will be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 20%. Such withholding tax will be in full
discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his/her
private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Relibi Law is assumed by the
Luxembourg paying agent.

**_Income Taxation_**

_Non-resident holders of Notes_

A non-resident holder of Notes, not having a permanent establishment or permanent representative in
Luxembourg to which/whom such Notes are attributable, is not subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest
accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes. A gain realized by such nonresident holder of Notes on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes is further not subject to
Luxembourg income tax.

A non-resident corporate holder of Notes or an individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the
management of a professional or business undertaking, who has a permanent establishment or permanent
representative in Luxembourg to which or to whom such Notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg income
tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes and on any gains
realized upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.


-----

_Resident holders of Notes_

Holders of Notes who are residents of Luxembourg will not be liable for any Luxembourg income tax
on repayment of principal.

_i._ _Luxembourg resident corporate holder of Notes_

A corporate holder of Notes must include any interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or
issue discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its
taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.

A corporate holder of Notes that is (i) an undertaking for collective investment (UCITS) within the
meaning of the law of December 17, 2010 as amended, (ii) a specialized investment fund (SIF) within the meaning
of the law of February 13, 2007, as amended, (iii) a private wealth management company (SPF) within the
meaning of the law dated May 11, 2007, as amended, or (iv) a reserved alternative investment fund (RAIF) within
the meaning of the law of 23 July 2016 and which does not fall under the special tax regime set out in article 48
thereof, is neither subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest accrued or received, any redemption
premium or issue discount, nor on gains realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

_ii._ _Luxembourg resident individual holder of Notes_

An individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject
to Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue
discounts, under the Notes, except if (i) withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with the
Relibi Law, or (ii) the individual holder of the Notes has opted for the application of a 20% tax in full discharge
of income tax in accordance with the Relibi Law, which applies if a payment of interest has been made or ascribed
by a paying agent established in a EU Member State (other than Luxembourg,) or in a Member State of the
European Economic Area (other than a EU Member State). A gain realized by an individual holder of Notes,
acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, upon the sale or disposal, in any form
whatsoever, of Notes is not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal took place more
than six months after the Notes were acquired. However, any portion of such gain corresponding to accrued but
unpaid interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax, except if tax has been levied on such interest in
accordance with the Relibi Law.

An individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or business
undertaking must include this interest in its taxable basis. If applicable, the tax levied in accordance with the Relibi
Law will be credited against his/her final tax liability.

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

Under current Luxembourg tax law and current administrative practice, it is not necessary that the Notes
be notarized, filed, recorded or enrolled with any court or other authority in Luxembourg, or that any stamp,
transfer, capital, registration or similar tax be paid on or in relation to the execution and delivery of the Notes in
accordance therewith or the performance of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, except if the Notes are either
(i) attached as an annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited
in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire). In such cases, the Notes will be subject to
a fixed EUR 12 duty or to an ad valorem duty payable by the party registering, or being ordered to register, the
Notes. The same registration duties could be due in the case of a registration of the Notes on a voluntary basis.

Where a holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the
Notes are included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of Notes if embodied in a Luxembourg deed passed in front of
a Luxembourg notary or recorded in Luxembourg.

**_VAT_**

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue
of the Notes or in respect of the payment of a redemption amount or principal under the Notes or the transfer of a
Note; provided that Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain
services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are rendered, or are


-----

deemed to be rendered, in Luxembourg and an exemption from value added tax does not apply with respect to
such services.

**_Net Wealth tax_**

Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on holders of the Notes unless:

a. Such holder of the Notes is a corporate which is, or is deemed to be, resident in Luxembourg for the
purpose of the relevant provisions and to the exception of the following entities that are net wealth tax
exempt, being (i) undertakings for collective investment (UCITS) within the meaning of the law of
December 17, 2010 as amended, (ii) investment company in risk capital (SICAR) within the meaning of
the law dated June 15, 2004, as amended,(iii) securitization entities within the meaning of the law dated
March 22, 2004 as amended, (iv) specialized investment funds (SIF) within the meaning of the law of
February 13, 2007, as amended, (v) professional pension institutions within the meaning of the law dated
July 13, 2005 as amended, (vi) private wealth management companies (SPF) within the meaning of the
law dated May 11, 2007 as amended and (vii) reserved alternative investment funds (RAIF) within the
meaning of the law of 23 July 2016; or

b. The Notes are attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is carried on by a corporate holder of the
Notes through a permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed base of business in
Luxembourg.

However, please note that securitization companies governed by the law of March 22, 2004 on
securitization, as amended, or capital companies governed by the law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles,
as amended, or companies governed by the law of July 13, 2005 on professional pension institutions, as amended,
or reserved alternative investment funds governed by the law of July 23, 2016 and which fall under the special
tax regime set out under article 48 thereof remain subject to a minimum net wealth tax. This minimum net wealth
tax amounts to EUR 4,815, if the relevant holder of Notes holds assets such as fixed financial assets, receivables
owed to affiliated companies, transferable securities, postal checking accounts, checks and cash, in a proportion
that exceeds 90% of its total balance sheet value and if the total balance sheet value of these assets exceeds EUR
350,000. Alternatively, if the relevant holder of Notes holds 90% or less of financial assets or if those financial
assets do not exceed EUR 350,000, a minimum net wealth tax varying between EUR 535 and EUR 32,100 would
apply depending on the size of its balance sheet.

An individual holder of Notes, whether he/she is a resident of Luxembourg or not, is not subject to
Luxembourg wealth tax on such Notes.

**_Common Reporting Standard_**

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has developed a new global standard for
the annual automatic exchange of financial information between tax authorities (the “CRS”). Luxembourg is a
signatory jurisdiction to the CRS and has implemented the CRS into Luxembourg domestic law via the law dated
18 December 2015 concerning the automatic exchange of information on financial accounts and tax matters and
implementing the EU Directive 2014/107/EU. The regulation may impose obligations on the Issuer and its
shareholders / holders of Notes, if the Issuer is actually regarded as a reporting Financial Institution under the
CRS law, so that the latter could be required to conduct due diligence and obtain (among other things)
confirmation of the tax residency (through the issuance of self-certifications forms by the holders of Notes), tax
identification number and CRS classification of the holders of Notes in order to fulfil its own legal obligations
pursuant to the CRS law.

Investors in the Notes should contact their own tax advisers regarding the application of CRS to their
particular circumstances.

**Certain United Kingdom Tax Considerations**

The following is a general description of certain UK tax consequences relating to the Notes and is based
on current UK tax law and HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) published practice, both of which may be subject
to change, possibly with retrospective effect. References to “interest” refer to interest as that term is understood
for UK tax purposes. This summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all UK tax considerations
relating to the Notes and it relates only to persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and who
hold such Notes as a capital investment. In particular, this summary does not deal with the tax treatment which


-----

may be applicable to certain classes of persons (such as brokers or dealers in securities and persons connected
with the Issuer) to whom special rules may apply.

If you are subject to tax in any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or if you are in any doubt as
to your tax position, you should consult an appropriate professional adviser.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

_Payment of interest on the Notes_

Provided that the interest on the Notes does not have a UK source, interest on the Notes may be paid
without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax.

If interest on the Notes does have UK source (“UK interest”), it will be payable without withholding or
deduction for or on account of UK income tax provided the Notes are and remain listed on a “recognised stock
exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the “ITA”). The Exchange is a
recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Securities such as the Notes will be treated as listed on The
Exchange if they are included in the Official List of The Exchange.

In other cases, an amount must be withheld from payments of UK interest on the Notes on account of
UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to the availability of any other exemptions or reliefs.
However, where an applicable double tax treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be
withheld in the UK) in relation to a holder of the Notes, HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to
that holder of the Notes without deduction of tax (or for interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided
for in the relevant double tax treaty).

_Payment under a Guarantee_

The UK withholding tax treatment of payments by a Guarantor which have a UK source is uncertain.
Depending on the correct legal analysis of payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts, if any,
due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) by a Guarantor as a matter of
UK tax law, it is possible that such payments may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently
20%), subject to any applicable exemptions or reliefs.

**_Further United Kingdom tax issues_**

If the interest on the Notes constitutes UK source income for tax purposes, it may be subject to UK tax
by way of direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without withholding or deduction.

However, UK interest received without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax
will not be chargeable to UK tax in the hands of a holder of the Notes (other than certain trustees) who is not
resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom unless (a) that holder of the Notes is a company which carries on
a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom or, if not such a
company, carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency, and (b)
the UK interest is received in connection with, or the Notes are attributable to, that permanent establishment,
branch or agency. There are exemptions for UK interest received by certain categories of agent (such as some
brokers and investment managers). The provisions of an applicable double taxation treaty may also be relevant
for such holders of the Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except
for the discussion and on FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”). This discussion
does not address the impact of the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income or the effects of any U.S.
federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or
non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to
be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a


-----

different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that
any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to
a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the consequences to holders subject to special
rules, such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies,
traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or
investors in such entities), persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income
with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement, persons liable for
alternative minimum tax, holders of the Existing Notes that are redeemed using the proceeds of this Offering and
persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated
transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and
at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes of the applicable series is sold to
the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). This discussion is limited to holders who hold the
Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any
entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of
the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to
U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust (a) if a court within the United States is able
to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (b) if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a
U.S. person.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes,
the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their
tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of
the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax**
**consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the**
**U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and**
**gift tax laws, the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income, and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax**
**laws.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the
_Notes–Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), we may be obligated to make_
certain payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. We believe that the foregoing
contingencies should not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Assuming such
position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional
payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses
in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position,
and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue
interest income at a rate different than their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital
gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note. This
disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are
urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment
debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on a Note (including additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes
and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder
as ordinary income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of


-----

accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest generally will be income from sources outside the United
States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize interest income
equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of
whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss
attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such
interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for
each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by
translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or,
with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the
U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable
year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual
period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of
receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes that
uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain
or loss with respect to accrued interest income, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference between
the U.S. dollar value of the payment received in respect of the accrued interest income, determined at the spot rate
on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously accrued in respect
of such payment (as described above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at
such time. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, and for U.S. foreign tax credit
purposes, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder
may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules
that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding
the availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
the event that the Sterling Notes, the Floating Rate Euro Notes or the Fixed Rate Euro Notes are issued with OID,
U.S. holders of such series of Notes issued with OID generally will be required to include such OID in gross
income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such U.S. holders generally will include
any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

A series of Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such series exceeds
its issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount
(generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount, multiplied by the number of complete years to
maturity from the issue date).

In the event that a Note is issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder is
the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion
thereof in which such U.S. holder holds the Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any
“accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be
of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer
than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual
period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the
Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on
the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period,
over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the
start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual
period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all


-----

principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the
Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price of the Floating Rate Euro Notes only,
the amounts of stated interest and OID on a Floating Rate Euro Note is determined by assuming that the interest
rate is based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Floating Rate Euro Note as of the issue date.

OID generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign
tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in the applicable foreign currency
and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in
the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.”

A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of
a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the
extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received,
determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued
OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first,
as receipts of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent
thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipts of principal.
This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, and for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes,
generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or
expense.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to the U.S. holder,
increased by any OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to such Note. The cost of a Note
purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date
of purchase, calculated at the spot rate on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a
cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects as described below, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar
value of the cost of the Note at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase.

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts
attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary income in accordance with
the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above to the extent not previously included in income by
the U.S. holder) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency generally will be the U.S.
dollar value of that amount based on the spot rate on the date payment is received or the Note is disposed of. If
the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis
taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If
an accrual method taxpayer makes such election, the election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments
from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does
not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate
fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute
ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount thereof
generally will be ordinary income or loss and, generally will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value
of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined based on the spot rate on the date
of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s
purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined based on the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder
acquired the Note. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued
and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments
_of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable) will be realized only to the extent of the total_
gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note,
and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit
limitation purposes.


-----

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on
the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or
loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the
time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any
such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain
prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign
currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the
foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including,
in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note or foreign currency
received in respect of a Note to the extent that any such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
results in a tax loss in excess of an applicable threshold amount. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to
determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement
to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of interest (including the accrual of OID, if any) and the proceeds from sales or
other dispositions (including retirements or redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. holder may be required to be
reported to the IRS unless the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In
addition, a U.S. holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a
taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the
appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets”
(as defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information (on IRS Form 8938) relating to an
interest in the Notes. If a U.S. holder does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to
substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes
of such holder for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which
such report is filed. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting
requirements, unless the Notes are held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions. Under certain
circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of
the Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), and
subject to the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold
U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain
U.S. source payments. Debt obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which
applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payment” are filed generally would be
“grandfathered” (and therefore not subject to withholding or such payments under FATCA) unless such
obligations are materially modified after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final
Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution,
FATCA is expected to apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of the grandfathering period. Under proposed Treasury
Regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on any Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered
would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the


-----

Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining “foreign passthru payments.” Taxpayers generally may
rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Certain non-U.S.
governments have entered into intergovernmental agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S.
governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules
described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment
in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes,
there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT)**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive for a common
financial transactions tax (“FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal,
Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (“Participating Member States”). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not
participate.

The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in the form proposed on February 14,
2013, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) under certain
circumstances.

Until recently, the FTT proposal was at a standstill at the level of the European Council. Following the
meeting of the Council of the EU of June 14, 2019, the FTT currently being considered by the Participating
Member States would be levied on the acquisition of shares or similar instruments of listed companies which have
their head office in a member state of the EU (and market capitalization in excess of €1 billion on December 1 of
the preceding year), rather than on any type of financial instrument. In order to reach a final agreement among the
Participating Member States, further work in the Council and its preparatory bodies will be required in order to
ensure that the competences, rights and obligations of non-participating EU member states are respected.

If the proposed directive or any similar tax was adopted and depending on the final terms and scope of
the FTT, transactions on the Notes could be subject to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market of the Notes
may be diminished.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States and is the
subject of legal challenge. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains
unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate. Subject to the final scope of any FTT, holders
of the Notes could be exposed to higher transaction fees and prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek
their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the
Notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the United States Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that
are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan
assets” of such employee benefit plans, plans, accounts or arrangements (pursuant to Section 3(42) of ERISA and
regulations promulgated under ERISA by the U.S. Department of Labor) (each, an “ERISA Plan”). Employee
benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined
in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the
requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; however, such plans may be subject to non-U.S., federal,
state, or local laws or regulations that are substantially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(“Similar Laws”) or which otherwise affect their ability to invest in the Notes. Any fiduciary of such a
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan considering an investment in the Notes (together with ERISA Plans,
“Plans”) should determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under such
laws or regulations.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit
certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under
ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of
such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders
investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is
in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other
applicable Similar Laws. A fiduciary of an ERISA Plan should consider the ERISA Plan’s particular
circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment in determining whether an investment in
the Notes satisfies these requirements.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of us, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the agents
and our and their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any ERISA
Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to
provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a
fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence
and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are
not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of
investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made
solely by each prospective ERISA Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is
available. Such transactions are referred to as “prohibited transactions” and include, without limitation, (1) a direct
or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any
property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by
or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of
the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect
to which the Transaction Parties are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result
in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless


-----

the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption.

The U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may
provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the sale, purchase or holding
of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined
by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate
accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance
company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In
addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code each provide a limited exemption
from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions,
provided that (i) neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates directly or indirectly have or exercise
any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA
Plan involved in the transaction and (ii) the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection
with the transaction. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that all of the conditions of any such
exemptions will be satisfied at the time the Notes are acquired by a purchaser or transferee, or thereafter, if the
facts relied upon for utilizing a prohibited transaction exemption change.

Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain
church plans and non-U.S. plans which are not subject to ERISA and the Code may contain fiduciary responsibility
and prohibited transaction requirements similar to those under Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code.
Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should consider the impact of Similar
Laws on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets”
of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have
represented and agreed that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and
hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition
by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes or an interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any
applicable Similar Laws.

Further, if the purchaser or subsequent transferee is an ERISA Plan, such purchaser or subsequent
transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that (i) none of Transaction Parties have acted as the
ERISA Plan’s fiduciary (within the meaning of ERISA or the Code), or has been relied upon for any advice, with
respect to the purchaser or transferee’s decision to acquire and hold the Notes, and (ii) the Transaction Parties
shall not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee
that is deemed to make these same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and
holding of such Note or any interest therein.

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should
not be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation,
administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this
discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date
of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon
persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other
persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan,
consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any
Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase
from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. Each of the sales will be made pursuant to a purchase
agreement among the Issuer, and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering memorandum (the
“Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Notes
if they purchase any of them.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the
cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may change the
price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers
may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their respective affiliates, including in respect of sales into the
United States. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to
reject orders in whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by its counsel
and our counsel.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to
sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or
guaranteed by, the Issuer, the Guarantors and their subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during
the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement until the date falling    days after the date of the final offering
memorandum without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or the laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except (i) to U.S.
persons that are both “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule
144A”)) and “qualified purchasers” (as defined in Section 2(a)(51)(A) of the U.S. Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the “U.S. Investment Company Act”)) in transactions exempt from the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) outside the United States to persons who
are neither U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”)) nor U.S.
residents (as defined for purposes of the U.S. Investment Company Act) in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an
offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether
or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such
offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Important
Information” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor;
and

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a Qualified
Investor. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom has been


-----

prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in
the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Luxembourg, Germany, the
Bailiwick of Jersey and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering
of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material
relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes
may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering
material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country
or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction.
This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering
Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the
offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to
_Prospective U.S. Investors” and “Notice to Certain European and United Kingdom Investors.” If a jurisdiction_
requires that the offering be made by a broker or dealer that is licensed in that jurisdiction, any offering that is
made in such jurisdiction shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers or any affiliates
thereof that is or are licensed as a broker or dealer in that jurisdiction.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale,
pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act
or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer will apply,
through its listing agent, Carey Olsen Corporate Finance Limited (“the Listing Agent”), to list the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that the listing will be obtained or, if
obtained, maintained.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes,
and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S.
Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you
will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability_
_to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be         business days (as such term
is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as “T +         ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in
the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering
Memorandum or the following         business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle
at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades
should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit
bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in
order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a
broker or dealer when Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering
transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Managers, or person(s) acting on behalf of
the Stabilization Manager, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the
relevant Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase the relevant Notes in the open


-----

markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of such Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may
also over-allot the offering of the relevant Notes creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase
relevant Notes in the open market to cover the applicable syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing
Managers may bid for and purchase relevant Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws
and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the relevant
Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in
these activities, and the Stabilizing Managers may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can
be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes—
_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_
_limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or
after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may
be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they
must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the
Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers
or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment
banking, financial advisory and/or commercial banking services (including hedging) to us and our affiliates,
including our shareholders, in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive
customary fees and commissions. Affiliates of the Initial Purchasers are lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and affiliates of an Initial Purchaser have invested in securities of an affiliate of the Issuer.
The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Furthermore, such
entities may act as counterparties in the hedging arrangements we or our affiliates, including our shareholders,
expect to enter into in connection with the Transactions and will receive customary fees for their services in such
capacities.

In the ordinary course of its business activities, each Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may make or hold
a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates, including our
shareholders. If the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with us or
our affiliates, including our shareholders, they may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us or our affiliates in
a manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase
of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered
hereby. Any such positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent
research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer
of any of the Notes offered hereby. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered
under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the securities laws of any
other applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are being offered and sold to the
Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

    - in the United States to persons that are both “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule
144A (“Rule 144A”) under the U.S. Securities Act) (“QIBs”) and “qualified purchasers” (as
defined in Section 2(a)(51)(A) of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
“U.S. Investment Company Act”) (“QPs”); and

    - outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S to non-U.S.
residents (as defined for purposes of the U.S. Investment Company Act).

The Issuer uses the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in
Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes hereunder (other than each of the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to have
acknowledged, represented, warranted and agreed with the Issuer, any Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers as
follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A and Regulation S are used herein as defined
therein):

1. it understands and acknowledges that (i) the Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and that the Notes
and the Notes Guarantees are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the
U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and (ii) unless so
registered, the Notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to
an exemption therefrom, or in any transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance with
the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) below;

2. it understands and acknowledges the Issuer has not been registered under the U.S. Investment Company
Act and the Issuer is exempt from registration as such by virtue of Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment
Company Act. Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment Company Act excepts from the provisions of the
U.S. Investment Company Act those issuers who privately place their securities solely to persons who at
the time of purchase are QPs. In general terms, QP means, among other things, any natural person who
owns not less than U.S. $5,000,000 in investments; any person who in the aggregate owns and invests
on a discretionary basis, not less than U.S. $25,000,000 in investments; and trusts as to which both the
settlor and the decision-making trustee are qualified purchasers (but only if such trust was not formed
for the specific purpose of making such investment);

3. it is neither the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) nor acting on the Issuer’s behalf and it is
either (a) both a QIB and a QP and it is aware that any sale of these Notes to it will be made in reliance
on Rule 144A, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another person that
is both a QIB and a QP, or (b) it is outside the United States and purchasing the Notes in an offshore
transaction in accordance with Regulation S and it is not a retail investor in the EEA or the United
Kingdom (for these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client
as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point
(10) of Article 4(a) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation
(a “Qualified Investor”);

4. it acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of the
foregoing, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or sale of any Notes, other
than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been
delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes.
It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as it has deemed


-----

necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask
questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither
the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum;

5. it is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for an account with respect to which it exercises sole
investment discretion and for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and
not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S.
Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the
disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its
or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes to any person that is both a QIB and
a QP pursuant to Rule 144A or in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S;

6. it understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is
purchasing Notes resold pursuant to Rule 144A, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its
acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Rule 144A Notes
prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year after the later of the Issue
Date and the last date on which the Issuer or any of their affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any
predecessor thereto) only (a) to the Issuer or any subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to a registration
statement which has been declared effective under the U.S Securities Act, (c) for so long as the Notes
are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is both a QIB and a QP
that purchases for its own account or for the account of another person that is both a QIB and a QP to
whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and
sales that occur outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S or (e)

PLAN, INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT OR ARRANGEMENT SUBJECT TO SECTION
4975 OF THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE
“CODE”), AN ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED TO INCLUDE
“PLAN ASSETS” (PURSUANT TO SECTION 3(42) OF ERISA AND REGULATIONS
PROMULGATED UNDER ERISA BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR) OF SUCH
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS, PLANS, ACCOUNTS OR ARRANGEMENTS (COLLECTIVELY,
“ERISA PLANS”) OR A GOVERNMENTAL PLAN, CHURCH PLAN OR NON-U.S. PLAN,

OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE OR SIMILAR VIOLATION UNDER ANY APPLICABLE
SIMILAR LAWS. FURTHER, IF THE PURCHASER OR SUBSEQUENT TRANSFEREE IS AN
ERISA PLAN, SUCH PURCHASER OR SUBSEQUENT TRANSFEREE WILL BE DEEMED TO
HAVE REPRESENTED AND WARRANTED THAT (1) NONE OF THE ISSUER, GUARANTORS
OR THE INITIAL PURCHASERS OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES (THE
“TRANSACTION PARTIES”) HAS ACTED AS THE ERISA PLAN’S FIDUCIARY (WITHIN THE
MEANING OF ERISA OR THE CODE), OR HAS BEEN RELIED UPON FOR ANY ADVICE, WITH
RESPECT TO THE PURCHASER OR TRANSFEREE’S DECISION TO ACQUIRE AND HOLD THE
SECURITIES, AND (2) THE TRANSACTION PARTIES SHALL NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFER SUCH SECURITIES OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN OTHERWISE THAN TO A
PURCHASER OR TRANSFEREE THAT IS DEEMED TO MAKE THESE SAME
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PURCHASE
AND HOLDING OF SUCH SECURITIES OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN.

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these notes.

8. it agrees that it will, and each subsequent holder is required to, give to each person to whom it transfers
the Notes notice of any restrictions on the transfer of such Notes, if then applicable;

9. it acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the Notes
within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with Rule 144A;

10. it acknowledges that the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration
or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us, the Transfer
Agent and the Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with;

11. it acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of
its acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its
purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is
acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has
sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make
the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements on behalf of each such
investor account;

12. it understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by us or the
Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Securities in any
jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be
subject to the selling restrictions set forth in this Offering Memorandum;

13. it confirms that you, or the investor account for which you act, is not a retail investor. For the purposes
of this paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:


-----

(i) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a Qualified Investor;

14. it understands that: (i) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor (as defined above) in the
EEA or the United Kingdom, and (ii) no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation
for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the
United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation;

15. it understands that the Issuer and each of the Guarnators will be a “covered fund” as defined in the
Volcker Rule in the absence of an exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. The definition of
“covered fund” in the Volcker Rule includes, among other things, any entity that would be an “investment
company” under the U.S. Investment Company Act but for the exclusion provided under Section 3(c)(1)
or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer and each of the Guarantors relies on Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S.
Investment Company Act for their exemption from registration thereunder (which limits sales of the
Notes to “qualified purchasers” as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act), they will
be“covered funds” for purposes of the Volcker Rule in the absence of an exclusion from the definition
of “covered fund”. Accordingly, “banking entities” (as defined under the Volcker Rule) that are subject
to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited under the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or
retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or any of the Guarantors as a “covered fund”, absent any
applicable exclusion from the definition of “covered fund” or exemption under the Volcker Rule. Under
the Volcker Rule, “ownership interest” is defined broadly to include any equity, partnership or other
similar interest, and the phrase “other similar interest” is further defined to include any participation or
other interest that entitles the holder of such interest to, amongst other things: (a) participate in the
selection or removal of management or otherwise (other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an
event of default or acceleration event and to participate in the removal of an investment manager for
“cause” (as defined therein) or in the selection of a replacement manager upon an investment manager’s
resignation or removal), (b) share in the income, gains or profits of the “covered fund”, (c) receive
underlying assets of the “covered fund” after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full
(other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of default or acceleration event), (d) receive
all or a portion of excess spread (as defined therein), (e) provide under the terms of the interest that the
amounts payable by the “covered fund with respect to the interest can be reduced based on losses arising
from the underlying assets of the “covered fund”, (f) receive income on a pass-through basis from the
“covered fund” or have a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the
underlying assets of the “covered fund”, or (g) any synthetic right to have, receive or be allocated any of
the rights in clauses (a) through (f) above; and

16. it represents and warrant that either (i) no portion of the assets used by purchaser or transferee to acquire
and hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any “employee benefit plan” subject to Title
I of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”), any
plan, individual retirement account or other arrangement subject to Section 4975 of the Code, an entity
whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” (pursuant to Section 3(42) of ERISA and
regulations promulgated under ERISA by the U.S. Department of Labor) of such employee benefit plans,
plans, accounts or arrangements (collectively, “ERISA Plans”) or a governmental plan, church plan or
non-U.S. plan, subject to provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. laws or regulations that are
similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”) or (ii) the acquisition,
holding and disposition by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes or an interest therein will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

Further, if the purchaser or subsequent transferee is an ERISA Plan, such purchaser or subsequent
transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that (i) none of the Issuer, Guarantors or the Initial
Purchaser or any of their respective affiliate (the “Transaction Parties”) has acted as the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary
(within the meaning of ERISA or the Code), or has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the purchaser
or transferee’s decision to acquire and hold the Notes, and (ii) the Transaction Parties shall not sell or otherwise
transfer such Notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these
same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of such Note or any
interest therein.

**AVAILABLE INFORMATION**

Each purchaser of Notes from an Initial Purchaser will be furnished a copy of this Offering Memorandum
and any related amendments or supplements to this Offering Memorandum. Each person receiving this Offering
Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to this Offering Memorandum acknowledges that:

1. such person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us and to review and has received, all
additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the
information herein;

2. such person has not relied on the Initial Purchaser or any person affiliated with the Initial Purchaser in

For so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the meaning of
Rule 144(a)(3) under the U.S. Securities Act, we will, during any period in which we are not subject to Section
13 or 15(d) under the U.S. Exchange Act, nor exempt from reporting thereunder pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), make
available to any holder or beneficial holder of a Note, or to any prospective purchaser of a Note designated by
such holder or beneficial holder, the information specified in, and meeting the requirements of, Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the U.S. Securities Act upon the written request of any such holder or beneficial owner. Any such request
should be directed to Garfunkelux Holdco 3 S.A., 488, route de Longwy, L-1940 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of

hours on any business day at the specified office of the Listing Agent for a period of 14 days following the grant
of listing of the Notes. See “Listing and General Information.”


-----

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company (société anonyme) established under the laws of
Luxembourg. The majority of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ managing directors, executive board members,
supervisory board members, directors, officers and other executives are expected to be neither residents nor
citizens of the United States. Furthermore, the majority of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ assets are located
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the
United States upon such persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors or to enforce against them, the Issuer or the
Guarantors judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities
laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors have appointed, or
will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of
civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an
action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic
of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments,
other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given
by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A conclusive
judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action
before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil
Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of
the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S.
judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

    - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional
competence according to German law;

    - the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a
timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of non-compliance with such
requirement, (i) the defendant does not invoke such non-compliance or (ii) has nevertheless
appeared in the proceedings;

    - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German
court or (ii) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is
recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the applicable judgment does not contradict
any such judgment under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

    - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law,
including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of the Federal Republic of
Germany (Grundrechte);

    - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

    - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was
pronounced.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after
having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles.
Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters
obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be
enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful
whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely
upon U.S. federal securities laws.

In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German
courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce


-----

the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary
to compensate actual losses or damages.

Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of
aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several
other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the
proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition
of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under
such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons
will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates.
A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment
rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and all of the directors and executive officers
of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer
is located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within the United States upon the Issuer, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the
civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral
awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the
payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who
received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg
(exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement)
pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the
enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met:

    - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (executoire) in the United States;

    - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the applicable matter under
applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the U.S. court is
recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law;

    - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules
(according to certain Luxembourg case law, it is admitted that Luxembourg courts which are asked
to grant an exequatur do not have to verify whether the substantive law actually applied by the
U.S. court awarding the judgment was the law which would have been thus designated;

    - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the
laws of Luxembourg;

    - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

    - the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity
to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and

    - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise)._

Please note that Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of
admissibility may change: additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while
other conditions may not be verified by Luxembourg courts in the future.


-----

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment,
although such a review is not statutorily prohibited.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in
Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not
bona fide or if the foreign law was not pleaded or proved or if pleaded and proved, the foreign law was contrary
to Luxembourg mandatory provisions (lois impératives) or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules,
and (ii) if its application is manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action
brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the
requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give
judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against
any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be
converted into euro.

**England and Wales**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be
recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and
Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such
an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S.
court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim
(assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English
court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

a. the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of
laws principles and rules of English private international law;

b. the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

c. the US. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it, and being for a definite sum of money;

d. the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy or the principles of the European Convention
on Human Rights or the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union;

e. the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue
law;

f. the U.S. judgment not being for multiple damages or on a claim for contribution in respect of multiple
damages;

g. the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

h. the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice;

i. there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court in respect of the same matter
involving the same parties;

j. the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by an English court; and

k. the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S.
judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that


-----

those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether
an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England
or Wales in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, it may not be possible
to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any
insolvency or similar proceedings, of if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment
creditor. Finally, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could
have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the
counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

**Jersey**

Simon Holdco Limited is incorporated in Jersey. The United States and Jersey currently do not have a
treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards)
in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment
in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action,
a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject
to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming
that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an
action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of
laws principles (which are broadly similar to the principles accepted under English common law);

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money
(although there are circumstances where non-money judgments can also be enforced);

    - the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature,
or in respect of a penalty or fine;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of
Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey
by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

    - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural
justice or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and

    - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those
judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United
States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Denmark**

We have been advised by our Danish counsel that the United States and Denmark currently do not have
a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards)
in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws, would not be recognized or enforceable in Denmark without a review of the merits of the case.

However, according to limited case law, which is based on non-statutory grounds and which does not
relate to recognition and enforcement of a judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or state court, a Danish courts
may—under certain circumstances and preconditions—recognize judgments from outside the EU, provided that


-----

the parties have agreed to the jurisdiction in question and to the domestic laws thereof, in each case subject to
Danish principles of justice (ordre public) and assuming that such judgment does not include any material defects.

Subject to the foregoing, it is uncertain to what extent investors may be able to enforce judgments in
Denmark in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. In the
predominant situations, it would be necessary to initiate legal proceedings before a Danish court for the purpose
of reinvestigating the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. federal or state courts.

**Sweden**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of December 12, 2012 of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters (recast) (the “Brussels Regulation”), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of
a Member State (as defined therein, i.e., all Member States of the European Union) and which is enforceable in
such a Member State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden without any declaration of enforceability being
required. The applicant will need to provide the competent enforcement authority, in accordance with of the
Swedish Enforcement Act (Sw. Utsökningsbalk 1981:774), with a copy of the judgment and a certificate certifying
that the judgment is enforceable, as further described in the Brussels Regulation. However, upon an application
against the enforcement pursuant to the Brussels Regulation the court with which the application is lodged may
refuse enforcement.

With regard to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil
and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a
Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a state, will be directly
enforceable in Sweden provided that the concerned party has submitted an application for declaration of
enforceability to the appropriate Swedish district court (Sw. tingsrätt) and comply with the proceedings of that
court and, if the judgment is declared enforceable, apply to the Swedish Enforcement Agency for enforcement in
accordance with the Swedish Enforcement Act (Sw. _Utsökningsbalk 1981:774) and comply with the relevant_
proceedings.

Judgments entered against any Swedish party in the courts of a state that is not a Member State under the
terms of the Brussels Regulation or a Contracting State under the terms of the Lugano Convention (e.g., the United
States), would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of right without retrial on its merits. If the
party in whose favor the final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in Sweden, the party
may however submit to the Swedish court the final judgment that has been rendered in the United States. A
judgment by a court in the United States may be regarded by a court, administrative tribunal or executive or other
public authority of Sweden as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which the judgment relates, and a Swedish
court may in its discretion choose to rehear the dispute ab initio.

**Finland**

As there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration
awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Finland, courts in Finland will not
automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title
for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a
Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence
of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute.
The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not
being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be
considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not
resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system.

As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law
and a Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation for actual losses and
damages as proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect
to any claims presented lies with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected
to plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including
the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties
will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of
documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is very limited. Depositions are also a form of


-----

taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral
main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.

**Norway**

Norwegian courts will, as a general rule, not recognize or enforce judgments rendered by a foreign court
unless Norway has entered into a bilateral or multilateral treaty with the relevant country or countries regarding
the recognition and enforcement of judgments and subject to the provisions of section 19-16 of the Norwegian
Dispute Act of 2005 No. 90 (Tvisteloven) (the “Dispute Act”). Due to the Lugano Conventions on the Recognition
of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), Norwegian courts will recognize as
a valid judgment, and enforce, any final civil judgment obtained in a foreign court in a state which is a party to
the Lugano Convention, without a further reexamination of the merits of the case. The exceptions stated in the
Lugano Convention itself will apply.

There is currently no treaty or bilateral agreement in place between the United States and Norway that
provides for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments by a U.S. federal or state court, in civil and
commercial matters. Thus, a judgment from a U.S. federal or state court would as a main rule not be enforceable
in Norway without an independent review of the merits of the case.

However, a judgement rendered by a a U.S. federal or state court may nertheless be recognized and enforced in
Norway without reexamination of the merits of the case if the foreign proceedings and the judgment itself fulfill
the conditions stated in the Norwegian Enforcement Act of 1992 No. 86 (Tvangsfullbyrdelsesloven) and the
Dispute Act. Such conditions can include, without limitation:

    - the respective parties thereto have submitted the matter in dispute in writing to a court or tribunal
in the agreed jurisdiction,

    - there is no other mandatory venue for such dispute,

    - such judgment obtained is final and enforceable in and pursuant to the laws of the country where it
was issued, and

    - the acceptance and enforcement of the judgment shall not be in conflict with Norwegian
mandatory laws or public policy.

In any other event, judgments by the court of a state that has no treaty or bilateral agreement with Norway
on recognition and enforcement of judgements against any Norwegian party would not be recognized or
enforceable in Norway without a retrial on the merits of the case. A retrial is dependent on Norwegian courts
having jurisdiction.

**CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES**

**AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

The validity and enforceability of the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and
may be limited under applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.
The following is a brief description of limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and
the Collateral and of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which Note Guarantees or
Collateral are being provided. The descriptions below do not purport to be complete or discuss all of the limitations
or considerations that may affect the Notes, the Note Guarantees or other security interests. Proceedings of
bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of
organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions
could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the security interest in the
Collateral. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such
limitations and considerations. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing,”
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile.” If
additional collateral is required to be granted in the future pursuant to the Indenture, such collateral will also be
subject to limitations and enforceability and validity, which may differ from those discussed below.

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of member states of the European
Union. Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the law of the United Kingdom. As noted above, on January
31, 2020, the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (“Brexit”) became effective and the UK entered
into a transition period, currently from January 31, 2020 until at least December 31, 2020 during which the
European Union will treat the UK as if it were still a member of the European Union (the “Transition Period”).
Therefore, for the purposes of this section, any European Union laws referred to herein remain in full force and
effect in the United Kingdom until the expiry of the Transition Period as they had been before Brexit and any
references to “European Union,” “member state” or “Member State” may be construed, where applicable, as
including the United Kingdom for these purposes. We have not considered in this section the impact of any model
to be adopted by the United Kingdom following the expiry of the Transition Period.

The Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated May 20, 2015
(recast) (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) became applicable from, and to insolvency proceedings opened from,
June 26, 2017. Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended from time to time
remains applicable to insolvency proceedings opened before that date. Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation,
the courts of the Member State (other than Denmark) in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that
term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main
insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its “centre of main
interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States (other than Denmark) may have
differing and even conflicting views. Under Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court that is requested
to open insolvency proceedings shall examine, of its own motion, whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article
3 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The EU Insolvency Regulation includes, among others, specifications regarding the identification of the
center of main interests. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, in the case of a company or
legal person, the center of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the
absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to
another Member State (other than Denmark) within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of
insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the
registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in another Member State
(other than Denmark) than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all
the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center
of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other Member
State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor
conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the center of main interests, this may require
informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g.
by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location
public through other appropriate means). Another change under the EU Insolvency Regulation focuses on the
definition of “establishment” as a prerequisite to open “territorial insolvency proceedings” (secondary insolvency
proceedings). Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, “establishment” means any place of operations where a debtor


-----

carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings
a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU)
2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on
June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are, among other things, to ensure that (i) viable
enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive
restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted
entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby
affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and
discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of
restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards
for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs
in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an
early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be
ensured. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of
individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States in national
legislation (subject to the debtor meeting certain conditions), (b) creditor claims may be restructured in a
restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class
and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class, (c) in a
restructuring plan all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a sufficient
commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate
classes) and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions,
be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the
restructuring plan with the required majority. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national
legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or
interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring in certain cases.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States
by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication
for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July
17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering
particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Several of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in
Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of any insolvency of such
Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany.
Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings
may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not
organized under German law (for example, if the centre of main interests of such company is within Germany)
or, vice versa, insolvency over the German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. See “Certain
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations—European Union.”_

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of the United
States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims,
the ability to obtain post petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors


-----

and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the
Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court _ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency_
proceedings (Antrag auf Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the
debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the
event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that, according to German case law, the debtor is unable to
pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due within the next three weeks for a period longer than three
weeks.

A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless, based on the prevailing
circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich).

A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debt when they fall due. In addition, only
the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk for the company of being unable to pay its debt as and when_
they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor
to file for insolvency proceedings.

If a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a public limited liability company
(Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other
company not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder or partner gets into a situation of illiquidity
and/or over-indebtedness, the managing director(s) or under certain circumstances the shareholders of such
company must file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay but in any event no
later than three weeks after such company has become illiquid and/or over-indebted. The management of a debtor
can be exposed to criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event that filings for insolvency are delayed
or not made at all.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary
protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third-party perspective—there is no reasonable
chance of a successful restructuring. In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will appoint a
preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to
immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor
enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor must prepare an insolvency plan which
will ideally be implemented in formal debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal
insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the
insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the
preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability
in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (as
amended the “COVInsAG”), provides, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency due to
over-indebtedness until December 31, 2020. The suspension – as in force from October 1, 2020 – applies unless
the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVInsAG also provides for a
relief from claw-back, if the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of filing duties, for the satisfaction
of claims or the provision of collateral for these claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive and unless the
creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing
illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in possession-proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event
the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the
management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency
administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on
the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and
preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of


-----

the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the
business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. This only applies, where
the debtor has not applied for so-called debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the
court will only appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of
the affairs by the debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger
_Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three_
requirements:

    - a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is
over-indebted);

    - revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year
preceding the filing; and/or

    - 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis.

The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of
other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important
decisions taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence
the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der
_Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter). The court opens_
formal insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements are met (in particular, but not
limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at
least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the
insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the
costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will
usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is
usually appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets unless
debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. The insolvency administrator may raise new
financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to
wind down the debtor. Satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten)
will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency
proceedings against a company subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

    - unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to
administer and dispose of assets of a German subsidiary of the Issuer would generally pass to the
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

    - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected
by management of a German subsidiary of the Issuer after the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings are null and void by operation of law;

    - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of a
German subsidiary of the Issuer’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate,
such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings;

    - claims against German subsidiaries of the Issuer may generally only be pursued in accordance with
the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

    - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person
does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency


-----

proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings
against the insolvency administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the
insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the
opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of
reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder
_Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not_
to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under
statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)) who wish to
assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement
action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is—in principle—subject to an automatic stay once the
insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency
petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims
in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent
sufficient assets are available). Certain secured creditors have preferential rights regarding the enforcement of
their security interests, but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their
security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the
sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the initiation of
insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security.

The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its
possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and
rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte)) as well as (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment
agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the
enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets
(Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually
add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant
security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets
of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Massekosten) first and afterwards the
preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the
insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the
insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of
unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the
insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an
insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which
requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each
class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules.

Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency
plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap with regards to the debt owed
to it by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of
the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process
which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of
authoritative case law, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process
in respect of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate,
whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the
secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency
administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described
above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its


-----

secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after
deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described above) and after satisfaction of certain
preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their
claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the holders of the Notes. If a German subsidiary
or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the
holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The
proceeds resulting from such collateral securing creditors other than the holders of the Notes may not be sufficient
to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Note Guarantees granted by the German Guarantors after satisfaction
of such secured creditors.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator,
however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years
before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An alternative distribution of
enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor
or the insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class
of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law
point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency
law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but
rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Recently a new insolvency law on group
of companies has entered into force on April 21, 2018 to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz
_zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), mainly intended to provide for a better coordination_
of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. It does not provide for a consolidation
of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of
a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key
amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group
insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings
(Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group
companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency
administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator”
(Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not
limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or
payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after
the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also
below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.”

If the circumstances for a suspension of filing obligations as set out above are met, the COVInsAG also
provides for a relief from lender liability, as any new loans or the provision of collateral for such loans is not
regarded against _bonos mores. This relief includes deferrals and “amend & extend” transactions. Powers of_
attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening
of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the
insolvency administrator opts for performance.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Lowell Holdco GmbH, Lowell Holding GmbH, GCG, SIR, PCS and IBW Verwaltungs (together with
IBW, the “German Guarantors”) are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or GmbH) (“GmbH”) and any security (including a guarantee) granted
by such a GmbH is subject to certain provision of the Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die
_Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbHG) (“GmbHG”)._

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets
determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (i.e., assets
minus liabilities and liability reserves) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall


-----

of, the amount of its stated share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees and any
other security granted by a GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company
are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to
secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and
31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements,
indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries
in the legal form of a GmbH incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the
beneficiaries of the guarantees or security interest agree to enforce the guarantees or security interest against the
German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH’s net assets falling
below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital (provided that the determination and
calculation of such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any security and Note
Guarantee provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH (incorporated or
established in Germany) will contain such limitation language in the manner described. This could lead to a
situation in which the respective Note Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all.

Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation
where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own
payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest
granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be
realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero.

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving
case law. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted
in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of German (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the
Issuer to make payment on the Notes, of the subsidiaries to make payments on the guarantees, of the secured
parties to enforce the collateral or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees.

Notwithstanding that the incurrence of the Note Guarantees by (German) direct or indirect subsidiaries
of the Issuer should, as of today, not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of such German Guarantor,
the enforcement of the Note Guarantees and security interests granted by such German Guarantors may be
excluded, according to certain provisions contained in the limitation language, if any high court decisions
(höchstrichterliche Entscheidung) of a German Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) or the German
Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) holding that the granting of a guarantee and/or security to secure any
obligation of an affiliated company within the meaning of Section 15 AktG of such guarantor and/or security
grantor (other than any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) in comparable circumstances may nevertheless in case
of the enforcement of such guarantee and/or security trigger any personal liability of the relevant German
Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG.

The limitations set out above apply mutatis mutandis if the Guarantee or security is granted by a German
Guarantor incorporated or established in Germany as a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft)
(including, without limitation, IBW) with a general partner (Komplementär) organized in the legal form of (i) a
GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or (ii) an entrepreneurs company with limited liability
(Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)), in relation to such general partner (Komplementär).

**_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_**

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held for the
benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the
Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes
from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent
becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the
Notes and the Indenture (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”). The pledges governed by German law will directly
and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure the
obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same
amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the security providers under the Notes
and the Note Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations
will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt
Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have,


-----

pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Security Providers for the full principal amount of
the Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the
pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts
will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted.
In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the
asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting
periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the
collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security
from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of
security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds
from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the
court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a company, which would be based on and governed
by the insolvency laws of Germany, the security interests granted as well as a guarantee provided by that entity
could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of
avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

On the basis of these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) transactions which
are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings, subject to specific periods. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders
of the Notes as well as granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s right to
challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior
to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. If the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the security were avoided,
holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency proceedings in the amount of their
original investment and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received by
the insolvency estate or to waive such Note Guarantee or security interest.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the
provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases, as amended by the act to
improve legal certainty with respect to avoidance claims under the German Insolvency Code and the German
Code on Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung
_und dem Anfechtungsgesetz) which became effective on April 5, 2017:_

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to
obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last
three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided
that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor
knew of such illiquidity (or of the circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was
illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of
circumstances that imperatively suggested such illiquidity or filing);

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to
obtain security (or guarantees) (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) to which such
creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at
which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken
during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the
petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was taken during the second or
third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the
creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency
creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggested such detrimental effect);


-----

    - a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors
or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim
against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three
months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor
was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the
illiquidity at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such
filing at the time of the transaction;

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor
grants security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been
granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted
with the intent to prejudice its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and
the beneficiary knew of such intention at the time of such act. In the case that the relevant act
granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the
avoidability of acts is limited to four years. “Knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of
such provision is presumed if the other party knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid
(drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. In case
the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form
or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of
the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the_
creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments shall establish
the rebuttable presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time;

    - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which
directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was
concluded more than two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of
corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the
management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share
capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information
about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or
members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or a similar claim if (i) in case of the provision of
security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act
took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for
shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or
interest and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor
in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or
imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an
economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year
prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a
shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case
the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debt generally as they fell due, that a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended
to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general


-----

statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been
challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.

The COVInsAG, however, provides for a privileged treatment of any kind of newly granted third party
financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial credits and other forms of financing) and
shareholder loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable
interest payments) of third party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered
disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020
and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties. This privilege also includes the
provision of collateral in favor of third party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of
collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar acts.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained
an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy
of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt
and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for
avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under
the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its
rights of avoidance in the courts.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s
(impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such
funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of
detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of
_bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of_
any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

During the suspension of filing obligations as set out above, the COVInsAG also provides for a relief
from lender liability, as any new loans or the provision of collateral for such loans is not regarded against bonos
mores. This relief shall include deferrals and “amend & extend” transactions.

The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future. On June 20, 2019,
the EU Restructuring Directive has been adopted. The EU Restructuring Directive was published in the Official
Journal of the European Union on June 26, 2019, and the member states have approximately two years to transpose
the substantive parts of the EU Restructuring Directive into their national legislation, although a one-year
extension can be granted. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to put in place key principles for all member states
on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency
procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key
feature of the EU Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The EU
Restructuring Directive sets out minimum standards to be applied by the member states (i.e., minimum
harmonization). Although certain features of the EU Restructuring Directive need to be transposed into national
legislation, the EU Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of
certain other features. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which
claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not
more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers and against the
voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e. outside formal insolvency proceedings.
The EU Restructuring Directive also provides for cross-class cram-down, i.e. even if the creditors of one class
voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the
restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the EU Restructuring
Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into national legislation. The
implementation of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new
financing. See also “—European Union—EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks.”

On September 19, 2020, the German ministry of justice and consumer protection published a ministerial
draft bill (Referentenentwurf), followed by a draft bill (Regierungsentwurf) published on October 14, 2020 by the
German Federal Government on a Law on Development of Restructuring and Insolvency Laws (Gesetz zur
_Fortentwicklung des Sanierungs- und Insolvenzrechts, SanInsFoG), providing in particular for the implementation_
of the EU Restructuring Directive into German law and stipulating certain other amendments of German


-----

insolvency laws, e.g. the implementation of the framework for an optional restructuring plan, the option for
proceedings led by the debtor and modular proceedings, a moratorium even before insolvency proceedings are
opened as well as certain measures due to consequences from COVID-19. According to the current draft the law
shall enter into force on January 1, 2021. This timing as well as the scope of regulations law are (as long as not
determined by the EU Restructuring Directive) still subject to changes in the on-going legislative process
(Gesetzgebungsverfahren).

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against
the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied
ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion
of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the
insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual
insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and
administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding
the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration and (v) claims for
restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. The CovInsAG, however, suspends the statutory subordination
of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up until
September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020
and where the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties.

**Luxembourg**

**_Insolvency_**

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more
limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of
proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be initiated against a company having its center
of main interests or an establishment (both terms within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in
Luxembourg:

    - bankruptcy proceedings (“faillite”), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by any
of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having
jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation
of payments (“cessation des paiements”) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness
(“ébranlement de crédit”). The main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation
of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as
the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company except, subject to certain limited
exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in
accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a
Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with
normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s
cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court
of the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision
they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of
managers’/directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy
(banqueroute simple) in accordance with Article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code;

    - controlled management proceedings (“gestion contrôlée”), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order
the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see the below
applicable provision of the Financial Collateral Law 2005);

    - composition proceedings (“concordat préventif de la faillite”), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not
by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to composition


-----

proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except for secured
creditors (please see the below applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005); or

    - in addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a
decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (“sursis de paiement”) or to put a
Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (“liquidation judiciaire”). Judicial liquidation
proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an
activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg
commercial code or of the Companies Law 1915. The management of such liquidation
proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy
proceedings.

Liability of a Luxembourg company in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the
company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation
(including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under
Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others:

    - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times
the minimum social salary);

    - employees’ contributions to social security;

    - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

    - employer’s contribution to social security;

    - landlords, for certain unpaid sums due to them; and

    - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution
to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

Favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments securing monetary
claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments) pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Article
20 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements (pledges,
security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as well as valuation and
enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the prebankruptcy preference period (période suspecte) against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and
other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud).

Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims
or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of
Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests
are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Law
2005. If Article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied (save in the case of fraud).

Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement
has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization
measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties,
administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it was
unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could
not reasonably be aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement.

_Impact of insolvency proceedings on transactions_

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended.
Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also
be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of
secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for
controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A

reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50%
of the relevant Issuer’s liabilities in order to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as
acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management
proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of default may still be served.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer
during the preference period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months plus ten days preceding the
judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect
period at an earlier date. In particular:

    - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de Commerce), specified
transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in
respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law
2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any
means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with
substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference period (or the ten days
preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency
receiver;

    - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts
as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject
to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were
concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and

    - pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and Article 1167 of the
Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the
granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts, therefore,
subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so
as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no
interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence
have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg company’s business and assets and such Luxembourg company’s
respective obligations under the Notes.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition
proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in
another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable will not be affected by the opening of
insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness,
voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of Article
24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 as described above and Article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation).

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests_**

Under Luxembourg law, contracts are in principle formed by the mere agreement (consentement)
between the parties thereto. The granting of any financial collateral governed by the Financial Collateral Law
2005 must be capable of being evidenced in writing. However, additional steps may be required to enforce security
interests against third parties. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts will generally
apply, in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over the assets subject to such
security interests, the law of the place where such assets subject are situated (lex rei sitae or _lex situs). As a_
consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security
interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg
companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims having debtors located in
Luxembourg and/or governed by Luxembourg law, securities which are held through an account located (or
deemed to be located) in Luxembourg and bearer securities physically held in Luxembourg.


-----

If certain assets are located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such
assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with
Luxembourg law. The creation, validity and enforcement of security interests such as pledges and transfer of
ownership as security, granted on financial instruments and claims (in order to secure cash settlement and/or
delivery of financial instruments) are notably governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Pursuant to the
Financial Collateral Law 2005, a pledge (gage) is effected by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the
pledgee or to a third party acting as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights over the pledged
assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession of such assets.

A physical transfer of possession not being possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the
Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides for a fictitious transfer of possession (i.e. perfection) which is effected by
mechanisms which depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares and other
registered instruments, the dispossession is validly realized by notifying the pledge to the issuer of such
shares/instruments or by an acceptance of the pledge by the issuer of such shares/instruments who in turn will
proceed to an entry of the pledge in the share register/the register of the relevant instruments (as applicable) held
by the issuer of such shares/instruments.

In case of cash bank accounts held in Luxembourg with a Luxembourg bank, the account-holding bank
generally has a first-ranking security right over the accounts and the balances thereof. Hence, a pledge over such
cash bank accounts is validly created and the dispossession is validly realized by notifying the pledge to the firstranking security beneficiary/the holder of the pledged accounts (i.e. the account-holding bank) and by the
acceptance of the pledge by such security beneficiary/holder of the pledged accounts, who in turn would normally
also waive its first-ranking security rights over the bank accounts concerned. If future bank accounts are pledged,
an additional notification to, and acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required for both the creation
and the perfection of the pledge over such future bank accounts.

A pledge granted over intragroup receivables is perfected once the relevant pledge agreement has been
entered into by all parties thereto. However, in order for the debtor under the pledged receivables not to be able
to validly liberate itself from its payment obligations thereunder by paying the pledgor instead of the Security
Agent, when the pledge agreement provides that such payment shall inure to the Security Agent, the debtor of
such receivables needs to be notified of or has to accept the pledge granted thereover.

The above perfection steps and actions need to be undertaken by the grantor of the security interest and/or
the Security Agent. If the relevant pledgor or the Security Agent fails or is unable to take the necessary
steps/actions required to take or perfect any of the above-mentioned security interests, such security interests will
not have been created and/or perfected with respect to the claims arising under the Notes.

Article 11 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 sets out the following enforcement methods, available
upon the occurrence of the relevant enforcement event in respect of a pledge governed by the provisions of the
Financial Collateral Law 2005:

    - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value
determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing
price of the pledged assets (if the pledged assets are listed on an official Luxembourg or foreign
stock market or traded on a recognized regulated market open to the public);

    - selling or causing the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially
reasonable terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange,
or (iii) by way of a public auction;

    - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations
following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

    - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Financial Collateral Law 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i)
the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need
to involve third parties, such as, _e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security_
interests might be delayed. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators
may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Luxembourg law


-----

governed security interests may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located outside of
Luxembourg.

Security interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the
powers of any receivers/administrators may not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular
where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the
Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or
assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under
Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another
Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any
third-party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security
interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor
may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the
pledges will in principle remain entitled in priority to the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by
operation of law).

When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees and/or security interests, applicable corporate
procedures normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that
have been appointed for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged guarantees and/or security
interests must comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object. The proposed action by the company
must be “in the corporate interest of the company,” which is a translation of the French “intérêt social,” an
equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined
by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of
acceptable corporate behavior.”

Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria
(provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective
judgment. In a group context, the interest of the companies of the group taken individually is not entirely
eliminated. With respect to guarantors and/or security grantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the
Companies Law 1915, does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee
and/or secure the indebtedness of another entity of the same group, it is generally held that within a group of
companies, in the context of a group of related companies, the existence of a group interest in granting upstream
or cross-stream assistance under any form (including under the form of guarantee or security) to other group
companies could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a Luxembourg company to grant such guarantee
or security, provided that the following conditions are met (and subject in any event to all the factual circumstances
of the matter): (i) such guarantee or security must be given for the purpose of promoting a common economic,
social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group, (ii) the
commitment to grant such guarantee or security must not be without consideration and such commitment must
not be manifestly disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group companies, and (iii) such
guarantee or security granted or any other financial commitments must not exceed the financial capabilities of the
committing company.

Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee or a security interest on a
group level is certainly important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a lack of
corporate interest for one or more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate
benefit is of particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the
Companies Law 1915. The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability
(personal and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. The guarantees or security
interests granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is
contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal
offenses addressed by the Company Law 1915, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted
for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person
may be an interested third party, e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In
addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a
misuse of corporate assets became known to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by
court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article
1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915 will be held null and void.


-----

The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based
judgment is required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. As a result of the
above developments, the guarantees or security interests granted by a Luxembourg company will be subject to
certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of
such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, _inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres) and certain_
intra-group liabilities), which is inserted in the relevant finance document(s), indenture or guarantee agreements
and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance
documents, indentures or guarantee agreements.

The registration of the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees,
Trustee’s accession deed to the Intercreditor Agreement and the transaction documents (and any document in
connection therewith) (the “Documents”) is required if such Documents are either (i) attached as an annex to an
act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary
(déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire). In such cases, as well as in case of a voluntary registration, the
Documents will be subject to registration duties payable by the party registering, or being ordered to register, the
Documents. Depending on the nature of the Documents, such registration duties would be ad valorem (such as
for instance a registration duty of 0.24% calculated on the amounts mentioned in those agreements) or fixed (such
as for instance a registration duty of €12 for a pledge). No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of security interest
agreements, which are subject to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Luxembourg courts or official Luxembourg
authorities may require (when these are presented before them) that the notes, the security interest agreements,
the indentures, the guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) and any
judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

**England and Wales**

The EU Insolvency Regulation remains in full force and effect in the United Kingdom, and the United
Kingdom will continue to be treated for the purposes of European Union law referred to in this section as if it
were a Member State until the expiry of the Transition Period. The position beyond December 31, 2020 is
unknown at this time as it depends on, among other things, a trade deal being agreed between the United Kingdom
and the European Union, and whether or not such a deal includes a replacement for the current automatic
recognition of United Kingdom insolvency procedures across the European Union and vice versa.

Certain Guarantors are incorporated in England and Wales, maintain their respective registered offices
in and conduct their businesses and the administration of their interests on a regular basis in and from England
and Wales (“English Guarantors” and each an “English Guarantor”). On the basis of these factors, an English
court may conclude that the English Guarantors have their “centre of main interests,” within the meaning of the
EU Insolvency Regulation, in England and therefore insolvency proceedings in England constituting “main
insolvency proceedings” under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation may be commenced in respect of an
English Guarantor in England & Wales. In such a case, English law would apply to those proceedings and the
effects of those proceedings must be recognized by Member States across the European Union (except Denmark).
Any insolvency proceedings of an English Guarantor would therefore likely, but not necessarily, proceed under
and be governed by English insolvency laws. The presumption of the company’s centre of main interests being at
the place of its registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU
Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all
the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre
of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other EU Member State.

Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings may be
commenced against a company in other Member States of the European Union (except Denmark) even if the
centre of main interests is in England, provided that the company has an establishment in that other Member State.
The effects of these proceedings would be restricted to the assets of the relevant company situated in that Member
State. Further, the EU Insolvency Regulation would not affect the jurisdiction of courts outside the European
Union (or the courts in Denmark) to open insolvency proceedings in respect of an English Guarantor in accordance
with their local insolvency laws. The Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030), which
implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency in Great Britain, provide that foreign (i.e.
non English) insolvency proceedings may be recognised in England where a company has its centre of main
interests or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non transitory economic activity
with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. In case of any conflict, the EU Insolvency
Regulation will prevail over the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006.


-----

Accordingly, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency
or similar proceedings would be commenced in respect of the English Guarantors or the outcome of such
proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of different jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in
conflict with, each other including in (but not limited to) the areas of the rights of secured and other creditors, the
ability to void preferential transfers, the priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain postpetition interest and the duration of proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could
call into question whether any particular jurisdictions’ laws should apply or would adversely affect your ability
to enforce your rights under the Note Guarantees and/or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts
that you may receive.

English insolvency law is different from the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar and it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings with respect to an English Guarantor.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of
ways, including by the company, its directors or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the
company, the directors of that company, or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) making
an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the
company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation) (see “—Temporary restrictions on winding-up petitions”
below regarding certain temporary restrictions in respect of winding-up petitions). A company may be wound up
if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay
its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes (in the case of an
administration commenced by a holder of a “qualifying floating charge,” the holder needs to show that the relevant
charge has become enforceable in accordance with its terms).

Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “English Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if
it is unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis
(i.e., unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (i.e., the value of the
company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective
liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, it fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory
demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or
similar court order).

Certain obligations under the Notes are secured by English law-governed security interests. Therefore,
English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of those security interests. Certain
obligations under the Notes are governed by English law-governed guarantees, and therefore English insolvency
laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of those Guarantees.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain
limitations on the security interests and/or guarantees that are governed by English law. The application of these
laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and/or the security interests relating
to the Notes and/or the guarantees relating to the Notes, and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may
receive in an insolvency of an English company.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

The security interests granted over the Collateral are a combination of fixed charge and floating charge
security interests. Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security: (i) an
administrator appointed to the company which granted the floating charge can dispose of floating charge assets
for cash or collect receivables charged by way of floating charge as though they were not subject to the charge,
although the holder of the floating charge will have the same priority in respect of the proceeds of sale as he or
she had in respect of the property/assets disposed of and where the assets are disposed of for cash, the administrator
or liquidator may use the proceeds and/or cash received for assets subject to a floating charge to meet certain
statutory administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the charged company’s
business whilst it is in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder (see (iii) below); (ii)
a fixed charge over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge over the assets, may rank prior to the
floating charge over the relevant assets provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed
charge is granted and the fixed charge holder had no notice of any restrictions on the grant of the relevant security
interest; (iii) general costs and expenses (including the insolvency office-holder’s remuneration) properly incurred
in a winding-up or administration are payable out of floating charge assets, to the extent the assets of the company
available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to certain restrictions for the costs


-----

of litigation), in priority to floating charge claims (the same does not apply to fixed charge claims); (iv) until the
floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge
security in the ordinary course of its business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charged company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (v) floating charge
security is subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law (please see “—Grant of Floating Charge”
below); and (vi) where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, floating charge
security is (a) subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions
and salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to employees) and (b)
subject to the claims of unsecured creditors in respect of a ring fenced amount of the proceeds (please see “—
_Prescribed Part” below) but only to the extent that the assets of the company available for unsecured creditors_
generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to certain restrictions for the costs of litigation incurred
in a liquidation). This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of the comparative disadvantages of
floating charge security.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security
interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where (among other things) the chargee
does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets
and the proceeds thereof, or does not exercise such control, in practice, as the description given to the charges in
the relevant security document as fixed charges are not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the
secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question
constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration and Administrative Receivership_**

Administration is an insolvency procedure under the English Insolvency Act, pursuant to which a
company may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory moratorium. The purpose of
the administration must be to achieve one of the following successive objectives: (i) rescuing the company as a
going concern, or, if that is not reasonably practicable; (ii) achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as
a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration), or, if that is
not reasonably practicable; (iii) realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferred
creditors provided that the interests of creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby.

A company may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out of court process.
Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration by the court
at the application of, among others, the company itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including
contingent and prospective creditors). An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company itself,
its directors or by the holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the company provided that such
qualifying floating charge has become enforceable. In addition, the holder of a qualifying floating charge has the
right to intervene in an administration application by applying to the court to appoint an alternative administrator
or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the appointment of an
administrative receiver.

For the Security Agent (as the holder of the floating charge security) to be able to appoint an
administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English
obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” and further, in the case of the appointment of an
administrative receiver, the appointment must not be prohibited by the English Insolvency Act (meaning it must
fall within one of the exemptions to the general prohibition which otherwise prevents the appointment of
administrative receivers).

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument
which: (i) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (ii) purports to empower the holder to appoint
an administrator of the company; or (iii) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver
within the meaning given by section 29(2) of the English Insolvency Act. The Security Agent will be the holder
of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together with other forms of security, relate to the
whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant English company and at least one such security
interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security
will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English company’s assets at the time that the floating charges
are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

The most relevant exception to the general prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver
is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the English Insolvency Act), which will


-----

apply if: (i) the issue of the Notes creates or is expected to create a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant
company during the life of the capital markets arrangement; and (ii) the arrangement involves the issue of a
“capital markets investment” (as defined in the English Insolvency Act). A “capital markets investment” includes
(among other things) certain debt instruments that fall within the scope of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI 2001/544) and are, or are designed to be, rated, listed or traded. In the
case of the Notes, they will be, or are designed to be, rated for the purposes of investment by an internationally
recognised rating agency.

Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration
order (in the case of a court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed with the
court. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a full statutory moratorium applies, pursuant
to which creditors cannot exercise certain of their rights against the company, including, among other things,
commencing a legal process against the company, winding up the company or enforcing security or repossessing
goods in the company’s possession under a hire purchase agreement without the consent of the administrator or
permission of the court. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over
that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the
moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial
instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), as amended.

The effect of the statutory moratorium is that were an English Guarantor to enter administration, it is
possible that the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it (other than security financial collateral
arrangements) may not be enforced while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent of the
administrator and, if and to the extent that any principal debt or guarantee obligation is owed it could be accelerated
or could be demanded (subject to the prohibition on ipso facto termination provisions (see “—Prohibition on ipso
_facto termination provisions” below)), but no meaningful enforcement action could be taken in respect of any_
failure to pay. In addition, a secured creditor could not appoint an administrative receiver (to enforce its security),
any administrative receiver already appointed would be required to vacate office and any receiver of part of an
English Guarantor’s property would be required to resign if requested to do so by the administrator (except a
receiver of a part appointed under a charge subject to the application of the Financial Collateral Regulations).

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure applicable to companies under the English Insolvency
Act. There are three ways an English Guarantor may be placed into liquidation or be “wound up;” these are: (i)
members’ voluntary liquidation (which is a procedure available to solvent companies only); (ii) creditors’
voluntary liquidation; and (iii) compulsory winding-up (a court-based procedure). There is no automatic statutory
moratorium that applies as a result of the liquidation (although in the case of a compulsory winding-up by the
courts, no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or continued against the relevant company except
with the leave of the court and, in the case of a voluntary liquidation, a liquidator, or any creditor or contributory
of the company, may apply for an equivalent stay on proceedings), and the holders of security interests are entitled
to take steps to enforce their security interests in all types of liquidation. The prohibition on ipso facto termination
provisions will apply in a liquidation (see “—Prohibition on ipso facto termination provisions” below).

**_Priority of Claims_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going
concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent
company and to distribute the realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the English Insolvency
Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the
proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set
out below. With the exception of the “Prescribed Part” (please see “—Prescribed Part” below), distributions
generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been
paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets
are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows:

_First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor,_
but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets;


-----

_Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of_
priority in which expenses are paid);

_Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are_
not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state
pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency
date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been
terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building
deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the
statutory limit. Secondary preferential debts include bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under
the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, and rank for payment after the discharge of the
ordinary preferential debts. If there are insufficient unsecured asset realizations to satisfy them, these expenses
and preferential debts are payable out of floating charge realizations in priority to the claims of the floating charge
holder, the expenses being paid in priority to the preferential debts.

The Finance Act 2020 (the “Finance Act”) received royal assent on July 22, 2020. Under the Finance
Act, HMRC will have secondary preferential creditor status in respect of certain tax debts (such as VAT, Pay As
You Earn (PAYE) taxes and employee national insurance contributions). This means that for certain tax debts,
HMRC will rank ahead of floating charge holders and unsecured creditors, although behind ordinary preferential
creditors. For all other tax debts (such as corporation tax), HMRC will remain an unsecured creditor. These
provisions will only apply in formal insolvency cases commencing on or after December 1, 2020. However,
floating charges created before that date will still be affected in those formal insolvencies;

_Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would_
include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on
proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realisations
to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (please see “—Prescribed Part” below) must, subject to
certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

_Fifth ranking:_

    - firstly, provable debts of general unsecured creditors. However, any secured creditor not repaid in
full from the realization of assets subject to its security can also claim the remaining debt due to it
(a shortfall) from the insolvent estate as an unsecured claim. To pay a shortfall, the insolvency
officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled
to any distribution from the “Prescribed Part” in respect of a shortfall unless the “Prescribed Part”
is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors (please see “—Prescribed Part” below);

    - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable
contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of
liquidation proceedings, or after the commencement of any administration proceedings which
either preceded such liquidation proceedings or which were converted into a liquidating
administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the
Note Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient
realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries;

    - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid;

_Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds_
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

In the limited circumstances of a winding-up or administration that occurs within 12 weeks of the new
standalone moratorium, the usual order of priority referred to above would be altered to give priority to any
moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts (please see “—CIGA order of priority following a
_moratorium” below)._


-----

_Prescribed Part_

An administrator, receiver (including an administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be
required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the
benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the relevant
company’s net property subject to the floating charge and 20% of the remainder over £10,000. The maximum
aggregate cap was, until recently, £600,000, but from April 6, 2020, the maximum aggregate cap was increased
to £800,000. It should be noted that this increase will only apply to floating charges created on or after April 6,
2020, so the increased cap does not apply where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the
holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by a company of security
and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an administrator or liquidator is appointed
to the company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or
security and, in addition, the company was “unable to pay its debts” when the security interest or guarantee was
granted or it became “unable to pay its debts” as a result.

If security or a guarantee granted by an English Guarantor is challenged under the laws of England and
Wales, and the court makes certain findings (as described further below), it may be permitted to:

    - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of that an English Guarantor’s obligations under the relevant
security and/or guarantee provided by such English Guarantor;

    - direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid by or realized from such English
Guarantor under a guarantee or security to the relevant English Guarantor or to a fund for the
benefit of the English Guarantor’s creditors; and/or

    - take other action that is detrimental to the holders of the Notes.

The Issuer and the Guarantors cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English Guarantor’s
insolvency (as described further below) is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a
security interest or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the
transaction as valid.

_Onset of Insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (i) the court application for an
administration order is issued, or (ii) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (iii)
otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to
court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where
liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration.

_Connected Persons_

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by
the company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out more particularly below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges includes (among others):

    - a party who is (i) a director of the company; (ii) a shadow director; (iii) an associate of such
director or shadow director; or (iv) an associate of the relevant company;


-----

    - a party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual; (ii) the
individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil
partner; or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual or (v) the husband,
wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner;

    - a party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company; and

    - a company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies,
or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his
associates have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each
company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of
the same person by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a
person of whom he is an associate.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and security interests:

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator (or its assignee) or administrator (or its assignee) of a
company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by the company
(or give other relief) on the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction
at an undervalue. The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the
company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives
consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such
company. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee or security must be granted within a period of two years
ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended). A court will
not generally make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered
into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so,
there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the
court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks
fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could
include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees, although
there is protection for a third party which benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value). In
any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or assignee of the claim) to demonstrate that
the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a “connected person”
(as defined in the English Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption the company was unable to pay
its debts and the connected person must demonstrate the company was not unable to pay its debts in such
proceedings.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator (or its assignee) or administrator (or its assignee) of a
company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by such
company (or give other relief) on the grounds that such a security interest or guarantee constituted a preference.
The grant of a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing an existing creditor (or a
surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than
if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the grant of the security
interest or guarantee must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined
in section 240 of the English Insolvency Act) if the beneficiary of the security interest or the guarantee is not a
connected person, or two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. A court will not make an order in respect
of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to
produce the “better position” for that person. Case law suggests that there must be a desire to prefer one creditor
over another and not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better
position. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such
orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which
could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees). There
is protection for a third party which benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith for value. In any
proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or assignee of the claim) to demonstrate that the English
company was unable to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that


-----

the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must
demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such desire.

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was
made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against
a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim, which that person is
making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This
provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with leave of the court if the
company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators. There is
no statutory time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to
the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time, or as
a result of, the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the
court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had
not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. However, such an order: (i)
cannot prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in good faith,
for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances; and (ii) cannot require a person who received a benefit
from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum
unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transaction_

An administrator (or its assignee) or a liquidator (or its assignee) can apply to court to set aside an
extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English
company in the period up to three years before the day on which that company entered into administration or went
into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the
credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether
unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly
contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under English insolvency law, if a company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of)
granting a floating charge then such floating charge can be avoided on the action of a liquidator or administrator
if it was granted in the period of one year ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 245 of the
English Insolvency Act) (or two years in the case of a floating charge in favor of a connected person). The floating
charge will, however, be validated to the extent of the value of the consideration provided for the creation of the
charge in the form of money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt
of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge plus interest payable on
such amounts. Where the floating charge is granted to a “connected person” the prerequisite to challenge that the
company is unable to pay its debts does not apply. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial
collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to
challenge as described in this paragraph.

_Onerous Property_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator (but not an administrator or administrative receiver) of a
company may also, by giving a prescribed notice, disclaim any “onerous property” (being property which is
unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other
onerous act). The disclaimer determines the rights, interests and liabilities of the company in the relevant property.
A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the
extent of the loss or damage and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up.

_Account Banks’ Right to Set-off_

With respect to English law governed charges over cash deposits (each an “Account Charge”) granted
by a chargor over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an
“Account Bank”) may have reserved their right at any time (whether prior to or upon a crystallization event under
the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling
or other arrangement with that chargor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a


-----

floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant
Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account
Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement
or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant chargor), whether the Account Bank
will continue to be entitled to exercise its netting and set-off rights is more complex .

**_Equitable Share Security_**

Security over shares granted by certain English Guarantors or over shares of an English Guarantor are
equitable charges, not legal mortgages or pledges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an
encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares. Remedies
in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the
court.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of an English law governed guarantee or security interest by any obligor guaranteeing or
securing (as the case may be) the obligations of another company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More
specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective obligor’s memorandum and articles of
association (or equivalent constitutional documents). To the extent these do not allow such an action, there is the
risk that the grant of the Note Guarantee and the subsequent Collateral can be found to be void and the respective
creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an obligor
in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate
benefit must be established for each English Guarantor by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section
172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would
be most likely to promote success of the relevant obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors
enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their
powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

Under the English company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including where such
security is not governed by English law) granted by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales (together with
prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in
England and Wales for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the
applicable security document. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English
companies to register security created on or after 6 April 2013, such security, if not registered within the 21 day
period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and a creditor of the applicable chargor.
Further, failure to register also means that the debt which was intended to be secured is deemed to have become
immediately payable.

In the event where the relevant security document is not registered, a chargor incorporated in England
and Wales may be required to enter into a new security document and register that with Companies House within
21 days of its creation.

Alternatively it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify the position and
allow the charge to be registered after the 21 day period has expired. This application can be made by a chargor
incorporated in England and Wales or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave
to register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard
to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position
of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration
of the security.

Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales
does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although they may still need to be registered with
the applicable asset registry).

Guarantees and security granted by a guarantor or security provider incorporated in England and Wales
as a public company are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance
within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006.


-----

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts,
the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single rate for each
currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the relevant date. If a
creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

**_Schemes of Arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a
compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors (or classes of creditors) where such company is
liable to be wound-up under the English Insolvency Act. In practice this means that the company must either be
a company incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 or one which has “sufficient connection” to the English
jurisdiction.

In practice, the “sufficient connection” test has been found to be satisfied by the English courts where,
among other things, the company has assets situated in England, the company’s centre of main interests is in
England, the company’s finance documents are governed by English law or have been amended in accordance
with their terms to be governed by English law. The law in this area is being closely considered by the English
courts and the fact that the “sufficient connection” test has been found to be satisfied in such cases previously
does not necessarily mean that this will be satisfied in all such cases as each case will be considered on its
particular facts and circumstances.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such
creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the
scheme. Such compromise or arrangement can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in
number representing 75% or more in value of those creditors present and voting at the creditors’ meeting of each
class vote in favor of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the
finance documents, that compromise will be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors
who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of
arrangement. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will
review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether
to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme, or
reject the scheme.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the English Insolvency Act, a company can request that its unsecured creditors
consent to a compromise of their debts. The company may propose whatever compromise it wishes and, provided
that compromise is approved by the requisite majority of creditors at a creditors’ meeting, it will bind all unsecured
creditors of the company who were entitled to vote whether or not they had notice of or voted at the creditors’
meeting.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement to be passed, it must be approved by 75% or more in
value of creditors present and voting on the resolution to approve the arrangement, provided that those who vote
against it represent 50% or less in value of those creditors who had notice of the meeting and who are not
connected to the company.

**_Recent reforms to the English insolvency regime_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the “CIGA”) came into force on June 26, 2020.
The CIGA contains a number of temporary measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of which will
have retrospective effect, and introduces permanent reforms to the English insolvency regime. The CIGA affects
the foregoing analysis and that analysis should be read in the context of the additional considerations outlined
below.

_Moratorium_

The CIGA inserts a new Part A1 in the English Insolvency Act which provides for a new, free-standing
moratorium for certain companies, which is intended to provide a company in financial distress with breathing
space in which to explore its rescue and restructuring options free from creditor enforcement action. Where a


-----

company is an English company that is not subject to a winding-up petition, the directors of the company can
obtain a moratorium by filing relevant documents with the court. Where an overseas company (or an English
company that is subject to a winding-up petition) wishes to obtain a moratorium, it must make an application to
the court. The application must contain a statement by the directors that in their view, the company is, or is likely
to become, unable to pay its debts as they fall due. The court will only grant a moratorium where it is satisfied
that the moratorium would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than the winding-up of
the company without first being subject to a moratorium and (in the case of an overseas company) if there is a
“sufficient connection” with the UK. The moratorium will be overseen by an insolvency practitioner acting as a
“monitor” although the directors will remain in charge of running the business on a day-to-day basis.

The effect of the moratorium will be to provide the company with a “payment holiday” in respect of its
“pre-moratorium debts.” In other words, the company will not be obliged to pay those debts during the
moratorium. A “pre-moratorium debt” is any debt or other liability of the company that has fallen due prior to the
commencement of the moratorium or which becomes due during the moratorium but under an obligation incurred
by the company prior to the commencement of the moratorium. A “moratorium debt” is any debt or other liability
that the company becomes subject to during the moratorium (other than by reason of an obligation entered into
prior to the moratorium) or to which the company may become subject after the end of the moratorium because
of an obligation incurred during the moratorium.

Certain pre-moratorium debts will be excluded from the operation of the moratorium regime, in so far as
they consist of amounts payable in respect of (a) the monitor’s remuneration or expenses; (b) goods or services
supplied during the moratorium (and which would otherwise be pre-moratorium debts because the supply contract
was entered into pre-moratorium); (c) rent in respect of a period during the moratorium (under leases entered into
pre-moratorium); (d) wages or salary arising under a contract of employment, regardless of when those wages or
salary fall due; (e) redundancy payments, regardless of when those payments fall due; or (f) debts or other
liabilities arising under a contract or other instrument involving financial services. These include (among others)
financial contracts (loans, financial leases, guarantees or commitments, commodities contracts, securities
contracts), derivatives and spot contracts, capital market arrangements and market contracts. The company is
expected to keep making payment on the pre-moratorium debts listed in paragraphs (a) to (f) above for the duration
of the moratorium. If those payments are not made, the monitor is required to bring the moratorium to an end.

In relation to the commencement of English insolvency proceedings, the moratorium will prevent (a) the
presentation of a winding-up petition and the making of a winding-up order by the court (except for petitions
made by directors or certain public interest petitions); (b) the passing of a resolution for the voluntary winding-up
of the company unless recommended by the directors; (c) the making of a winding-up order, except on petition
by the directors; and (d) the appointment of an administrator, the appointment of an administrative receiver, or
the application for an administration order (except if made by the directors).

In relation to enforcement rights and legal proceedings, the moratorium will prevent (a) forfeiture of a
lease by peaceable re-entry of business premises by a landlord; (b) the enforcement of security over the company’s
property except where security constitutes a collateral security charge or financial collateral or security has been
granted during the moratorium with the monitor’s consent; (c) the repossession of goods under a hire-purchase
agreement; (d) the commencement or continuation of legal process against the company and its property (with
limited exceptions); and (e) the crystallisation of a floating charge or any imposition of a restriction on disposal
of a floating charge asset. Any provision of a document which provides for the appointment of a receiver on the
commencement of a moratorium or anything done with a view to commencing the moratorium will also be void.
This substantially mirrors the moratorium currently available in an administration of a company (see “—
_Administration and Administrative Receivership” above), except in relation to the crystallisation of floating_
charges and the invalidation of provisions relating to the appointment of a receiver. The court may give permission
to creditors to take certain steps above, provided an application for permission may not be made for the purpose
of enforcing pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday.

The moratorium will be for an initial period of 20 business days (beginning with the business day after
it comes into force) with the possibility of extension by a further 20 business days by filing certain documents
with the court (at any time after the 15th business day of the initial period). This one-time extension can be done
by the directors without the consent of the creditors. There are a number of additional possibilities for extension
of the moratorium, including extension of the moratorium with the consent of the creditors for a maximum period
of up to 12 months from its commencement, extension with the consent of the court for an unlimited period and
extension in connection with the implementation of a company voluntary arrangement, scheme of arrangement or
restructuring plan.


-----

The following companies are excluded from the moratorium regime: any company that is or has been
subject to an insolvency procedure or moratorium in the preceding 12 months, any insurance company, bank,
electronic money institution, investment bank or investment firm, companies that are party to market
contracts/market charges, participants in a designated system, payment institutions, operators of payment systems,
recognized investment exchanges, securitisation companies, parties to capital market arrangements (involving
debt of at least £10 million), public private partnership project companies and certain overseas companies. As
such, an English Guarantor may be excluded from the operation of the moratorium regime.

_Restructuring plan_

The CIGA inserts a new Part 26A in the Companies Act 2006 which provides for a new restructuring
plan procedure which is intended broadly to follow the process for a scheme of arrangement. A company can
propose a restructuring plan to its creditors and/or members. Creditors and members will be divided into classes
based on the similarity or otherwise of their rights prior to the restructuring plan and following implementation of
the plan. The court must approve the class formation and the convening of restructuring plan meetings. Each class
will then vote on whether they accept the plan and provided that sufficient creditors/members approve the plan
and the court considers it a proper exercise of its discretion to sanction the plan, then the plan will be binding on
all creditors and members regardless of whether they, individually or as a class, approved the plan.

As with schemes of arrangement, under the CIGA the restructuring plan will be available not just to
companies incorporated in the United Kingdom but to any company with a sufficient connection to the UK (see
“—Schemes of Arrangement” above).

There are two additional conditions a company must meet in order to use a restructuring plan: (a) the
company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may
affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern (this is different to a scheme of arrangement, which can
be proposed by a company in financial distress or a completely solvent company); and (b) a compromise or
arrangement must be proposed between the company and its creditor or members (or any class of either) and the
purpose of such compromise or arrangement must be to eliminate, reduce, prevent or mitigate the effect of any of
the financial difficulties the company is facing.

Before the court considers the sanction of a restructuring plan, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new
rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. Creditors or members of the company whose
rights are affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in the meeting and vote on
the plan but there is no need to include creditors or members whose rights are not affected. Furthermore, a court
may exclude even a creditor or member whose rights are affected where it is satisfied that none of the members
of that class has a genuine economic interest in the company.

In respect of a consensual restructuring plan (i.e. one where each class votes in favour) to be capable of
being sanctioned by the court, 75% in value of creditors or members present and voting (in person or by proxy)
in each class must agree the compromise or arrangement. This is similar to the threshold in a scheme of
arrangement but, unlike with a scheme of arrangement, there is no numerosity test requiring at least 50% by
number of creditors voting in favour.

In respect of a “cram-down” restructuring plan (i.e. a restructuring plan where there is a dissenting class
of creditors or members), the court may still sanction a plan, provided that (a) the court is satisfied that none of
the dissenting classes are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative”
(referred to below); and (b) the plan has been agreed by a number representing 75% in value of a class of creditors
or (as the case may be) of members, present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or
have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. Again, there is no
numerosity requirement. The relevant alternative is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in
relation to the company if the compromise or arrangement were not sanctioned by the court.

As with a scheme of arrangement, the restructuring plan then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a
sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the restructuring plan and consider whether it is
reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order
conditional upon modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan.


-----

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a
moratorium on claims or proceedings (but note “Prohibition on ipso facto termination provisions” below).

_Prohibition on ipso facto termination provisions_

Under the CIGA, there is a prohibition on the exercise of contractual termination provisions in any
contract for the supply of goods and services to a company, or ‘doing any other thing’ in respect of that contract,
by reason of the company entering into an ‘insolvency procedure’. An ‘insolvency procedure’ includes where (a)
a moratorium comes into force for the company under the new moratorium procedure; (b) the company enters
administration; (c) an administrative receiver of the company is appointed; (d) a company voluntary arrangement
takes effect in relation to the company; (e) the company goes into liquidation or a provisional liquidator is
appointed; or (f) a convening order is made by the court in respect of a restructuring plan. The prohibition on the
termination or variation of any contract for the supply of goods and services does not apply to schemes of
arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (although, as set out above, it does apply to restructuring
plans).

If the supplier had a right to terminate the contract or supply before the company became subject to an
insolvency procedure but did not exercise that right, the supplier may not terminate for that reason during the
insolvency period. Therefore, if a supplier does not exercise its rights in relation to a pre-insolvency default, it
will temporarily lose that right once the insolvency procedure has commenced. Where the prohibitions on
termination or variation are in effect, the supplier may only terminate the contract if (a) the relevant office-holder
(i.e. the administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator or provisional liquidator) consents to the termination;
(b) the company consents to the termination; or (c) the court is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would
cause the supplier hardship and grants permission for the termination of the contract.

Certain entities are excluded from the prohibition on ipso facto termination provisions and will not be
subject to them where they themselves are in distress or where they are a supplier to a business in distress. The
excluded entities include deposit-taking and investment banks and insurance companies, so any contracts with
these types of entity would be excluded. In addition, the prohibition only applies to contracts for the supply of
goods and services. Financial contracts are excluded from these provisions and can continue to be terminated or
varied on the grounds of insolvency. The list of what constitutes a ‘financial contract’ is extensive and includes
loan agreements, financial leasing, swap agreements and derivatives and capital market arrangements. There is
also a carve-out for any set-off or netting arrangement.

_Temporary restrictions on winding-up petitions_

The CIGA provides for temporary restrictions on certain types of enforcement action in respect of unpaid debts.
Specifically, the CIGA: (i) prevents any statutory demands issued against companies in the “relevant period”
which is the period between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 (the “relevant period” having been extended
by three months since the CIGA came into force), from being used as the basis of a winding-up petition at any
point on or after April 27, 2020; and (ii) in respect of any winding-up petition presented in the period from April
27, 2020 to December 31, 2020, creates an additional condition that must be satisfied before a creditor can
obtain a winding-up order against a company on the grounds that it is unable to pay its debts, namely that any
creditor asking the court to make a winding-up order on those grounds must first demonstrate to the court that
the company’s inability to pay its debts was not caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The time periods within
which these provisions will apply may be further extended by statutory instrument (for a further period of up to
three months).

_CIGA order of priority following a moratorium_

The CIGA provides that, in any winding-up or administration that occurs within 12 weeks of a
moratorium, any moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts are to be paid ahead of the claims of
unsecured creditors, floating charge creditors and other expenses such as the liquidator’s or administrator’s fees.
This does not include pre-moratorium debt that fell due during the relevant period by reason of an acceleration or
early termination clause in a contract or other instrument involving financial services. In the limited circumstances
of a winding-up or administration that occurs within 12 weeks of a moratorium, the usual order of priority referred
to in “—Priority of Claims” above would be altered to give priority to those moratorium debts and priority premoratorium debts.

**Jersey**

**_Insolvency_**

Simon Holdco Limited is incorporated in Jersey and is subject to Jersey insolvency laws which may pose
particular risks for holders of the Notes with respect to the enforcement of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.

Simon Holdco Limited is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. Consequently, in the event of an
insolvency of Simon Holdco Limited, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal
regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: “désastre” and creditors’ winding up. The principal type of insolvency
procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey under
the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property
of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of “désastre,” title and possession of the
property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With
effect from the date of declaration, subject to what is set out below, a creditor has no other remedy against the
property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal
Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt but may prove in the désastre. With effect from the date
of declaration, a secured party may, however, without the consent of the Viscount and without an order of the
court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the
Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are
insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the property or person of
the debtor, and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal
Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the balance of the debt.

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding-up of
an insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up, a
liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a
different liquidator. The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather
assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the
commencement of the winding up, no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company except with the
leave of court. The shareholders must give creditors 14 days’ notice of the meeting to commence the creditors’
winding up. After the commencement of the creditors’ winding up, a secured party may, however, without the
sanction of a liquidator and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under
Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement
are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, the secured party has no other remedy against the company without
leave of the court. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding up
procedure, when the company is dissolved (although the powers of the liquidator shall, subject to the sanction of
the court or the creditors (or a validly appointed committee of the creditors), be limited to such powers as may be
required for the company’s beneficial winding-up). The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company
(subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately
before or in the course of its winding up if (inter alia) three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded
to the arrangement.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Under Article 125 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may sanction a compromise or arrangement
(a "Scheme") between a Jersey company and its creditors or shareholders (or a class of either of them). The court
may, on application of the company (or a creditor or shareholder, or if the company is being wound up, a
liquidator), order a meeting to be called at which the Scheme will need to be agreed to by a majority in number
representing:

    - 75% in value of the creditors (or class of creditors); or

    - 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders (or class of shareholders),

as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy. If the requisite majority of creditors
or shareholders (or of the relevant class of either of them) agree to the Scheme and, following such agreement,
the court sanctions the Scheme, the Scheme is binding on all creditors or shareholders (or on the relevant class of
either of them) and on the company (or any liquidator and contributories of the company if the company is being
wound up).


-----

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”)
or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up, a procedure which is instigated by shareholders not creditors),
set aside a transaction (including any guarantee or security interest) entered into by a company with any person
(the “other party”) at an undervalue. There is a five-year look-back period from the date of commencement of
the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to
this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed
provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the
operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into such a transaction with a person connected with the
company or with an associate of the company.

**_Preference_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the
court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en
_désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference (including any guarantee or_
security interest) given by the company to any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month look-back period
from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are
susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a
preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected
with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”)
or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor company
which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the
winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this
rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date
of the declaration of “désastre” and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six
months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company.
“Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property
if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a
liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the rights, interests and liabilities of the
company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the company/debtor from all liability
in respect of the property as of the date of commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the
declaration but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor from
liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a
disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing
as a creditor in the “désastre” or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law
contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

**_Fraudulent Dispositions_**

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey
customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating
creditors’ claims may be set aside.


-----

**_Floating Charges_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have
capacity to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent that any
floating charge or other security interest governed by foreign law is expressed to apply to any asset, property and
undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge or other security interest
is not likely to be held valid and enforceable by the Courts of Jersey in respect of Jersey situs assets.

**_Administrators, Receivers and Statutory and Non statutory Requests for Assistance_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the
Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not
part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognize the powers of an administrator,
administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey court may assist the courts of
prescribed countries and territories in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the
Jersey court thinks fit. These prescribed jurisdictions include the United Kingdom. Further, in doing so, the Royal
Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely
to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If the request comes from a prescribed country but not by a court-made request or from a non-prescribed
country, then common law and principles of comity will be considered by the Royal Court by virtue of its inherent
jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are afoot in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and
extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency
regime. If the requesting country adheres to principles of territoriality, as opposed to universality, and, for instance,
ring-fences assets for local creditors, full cooperation is highly unlikely. If, however, the jurisdiction applies
similar fundamental principles to those applied in Jersey, the Royal Court’s approach is more likely to be similar
to the position where prescribed countries are involved.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the
UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. It
would also be wrong to assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance with the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Union for the purposes of implementation of
its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and
the automatic test of centre of main interests does not apply as a result.

**_Enforcement of Security and Security in Insolvency_**

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors, but insolvency or bankruptcy alone will not render such security interest invalid or non-binding on the
parties thereto or any liquidator of a Jersey company or the Viscount in a désastre of a Jersey company’s property.

Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey
law. The shares of the Issuer and Garfunkelux PBA S.à r.l. in Simon Holdco Limited will be secured pursuant to
Jersey law governed security interest agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may enforce
security over intangible movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition
a secured party may take certain ancillary actions including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a
security agreement to the extent not in conflict with the 2012 Law. More than one enforcement option can be
taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other
rights of a secured party. The power of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and
written notice specifying the event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement
is by way of sale or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days prior written notice.
Importantly, the grantor may agree in writing to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to
include such a waiver in the security agreement. The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give at
least 14 days prior written notice to: (i) any person who 21 days before the sale or appropriation has a registered
security interest in the collateral; and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral
and has, not less than 21 days before the sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest,
unless, in each case, the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are specific carveouts from the obligation to give notice of sale. On exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale,


-----

the secured party must: (i) take all commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the
fair market value of the collateral, as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially
reasonable manner in relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any
agreement for or in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is
owed to the grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party was required to give notice of sale or
appropriation (whether or not they have agreed in writing to waive the notice requirements). If, in exercising its
powers of enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on
which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give certain persons (being the grantor (subject to it having waived
this requirement), any person with a registered subordinate security interest and certain persons claiming an
interest in the collateral) a written statement of account setting out certain information in relation to that
appropriation or sale. If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of
appropriation or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the secured party,
the secured party shall pay the amount of any resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in due order
of priority, to any person who has a subordinate security interest in the collateral and has registered a financing
statement over that security interest (where the registration remained effective immediately before the
appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than the grantor) who has given the secured party
notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in respect of which the secured party is satisfied that
that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the
relevant debtor grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may discharge its obligation above with respect to any
surplus by paying that amount into the Royal Court. The surplus may then only be paid out on the order of the
court on application by a person entitled to the surplus.

**Denmark**

Any insolvency proceedings with respect to a Danish security provider would be based on Danish
insolvency laws. The EU Insolvency Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) no. 848/2015 on insolvency
proceedings) does not apply to Denmark.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of a debtor or a creditor, however
provided that the debtor is insolvent, which pursuant to the Danish Bankruptcy Act is defined as the debtor’s
inability to pay his debts as they fall due, unless such inability is considered to be temporary.

The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor
operates his business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt of the petition for
bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive information as to whether and when a
debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (debtor’s own petition). The bankruptcy court does not provide
information on a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy.

A creditor cannot demand that the debtor be declared bankrupt if the creditor’s claim is secured by
adequate security. In this context, adequate security means a security right expected to provide full coverage for
the creditor. If the security is avoidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been performed, the creditor
does not have adequate security.

The creditor is not required to have a basis of execution for his claim, e.g. a judgment in a civil case, a
settlement in court or a signed debt instrument or mortgage. Further, the creditor’s claim does not have to be due
for payment to form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. However, the creditor must have a legal interest in the
debtor’s estate being administered in bankruptcy. As a result, not all claims that have not become due for payment
may form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. Depending on the circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in
force or a repayment arrangement being observed by the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being rejected.
The requirement for legal interest also means that in general the bankruptcy court will reject a creditor’s petition
for bankruptcy if it is clear in advance that he will not receive any dividend in case of bankruptcy. It should be
noted, however, that if there is probable cause to believe that the debtor has made avoidable transactions, the
creditor may have the required legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have substantial assets.
In that case, the creditor must be able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with some degree of certainty.

A creditor having filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor will be liable to pay damages if the
debtor suffers a loss or to pay compensation for injury to the debtor’s reputation if the bankruptcy conditions, e.g.
the insolvency requirement, are not fulfilled or if the claim does not exist.


-----

The petitioner must grant security for the expenses relating to the administration of the estate. In practice,
the bankruptcy court demands security in the amount of DKK 30,000. If the debtor has filed the petition for
bankruptcy, the security must be provided by the funds of the bankruptcy estate.

**_Bankruptcy Trustee_**

One or more trustees are appointed at the discretion of the bankruptcy court; however, in practice the
request of the major unsecured and unsubordinated creditors have the decisive influence as another liquidator can
be appointed at a creditor’s meeting.

The trustee is not required to be an attorney, but in practice that is always the case.

The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules of the Bankruptcy Act. Consequently, the trustee
must not be the debtor’s related party or depending on the debtor, and there must not be any doubt as to whether
the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is prevented from being appointed as trustee
due to the disqualification rules. The bankruptcy court may also find that a person being a member of the board
of directors of the debtor’s business or a person being the debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee.

The trustee will make all decisions concerning the administration of the bankruptcy estate, and he
represents the estate in every respect.

**_Reconstruction_**

Reconstruction proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of the debtor or a creditor. The
petition for reconstruction must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor operates his
business.

Reconstruction proceedings may only be commenced if the debtor is insolvent (same as described above
with respect to bankruptcy). If this criterion is fulfilled, the bankruptcy court will immediately appoint a
reconstructor and a restructuring accountant to administrate the company. The management continues to operate
the company, but any material transactions may not be carried out without the prior approval of the reconstructor.
Payment of creditors may only be done in accordance with the priority of claims as described below.

The reconstruction of a company must achieve the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue of the
company as a going concern by means of a compulsory composition; (2) the termination of the business of the
company by transferring the business; or (3) a combination of a compulsory composition and a transfer of
business.

The reconstructor must try to achieve these objectives in no particular order. If the reconstructor does
not realize these objectives, the company will automatically enter bankruptcy proceedings as described above,
unless it turns out that the company is not (or no longer is) insolvent.

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors and, providing all creditors have been paid in full, the shareholders. In
Denmark, liquidation is not an insolvency proceeding, and only companies that are solvent can be liquidated. If a
company is insolvent, or if it turns out during the liquidation process that the company cannot pay all its creditors
in full, the company must enter bankruptcy proceedings instead. The decision to liquidate a company is made by
the shareholders of the company at a general meeting who also appoint a liquidator, or, under certain conditions,
by the Danish Business Authority pursuant to the compulsory dissolution procedure in the Danish Companies Act
(Consolidated Act No. 763 July 23 2019). At the end of the liquidation process the company will be dissolved.

**_Challenges to the Collateral in Insolvency_**

Certain Avoidance rules

Under the Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy estate is entitled to under certain circumstances to avoid the
debtor’s transactions in the period preceding the bankruptcy if such transactions have reduced the assets of the
estate or otherwise damaged the estate, or if the transactions have favored certain creditors without observing the
ranking of the creditors.


-----

Transactions damaging the estate are for example gifts or the payment of excessive salary or pension to
related parties. Transactions favoring creditors without observing the ranking of creditors are for example payment
by unusual means of payment, payments before due date, payments having deteriorated the debtor’s ability to pay
decisively or the provision of security for pre-existing, unsecured debts. The avoidance rule on security for
pre-existing debts and the general avoidance rule applicable to various transactions are described below.

Any security interest which has not been granted prior to, or simultaneously with, the debt obligations
which it secures and which is not perfected without undue delay after the creation of such debt obligations will
generally be subject to a three months hardening period, if insolvency proceedings are commenced against the
provider of the security during the three month period starting from the latter of the date of the relevant act of
perfection and the creation of the security interest. The timing requirements in respect of granting of security and
perfection are interpreted very strictly under Danish law and “undue delay” in practice means as soon as practically
possible.

Danish law operates with a general avoidance rule, which stipulates that a transaction which unduly
(improperly) favors a creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the company’s assets are
prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the company’s debt is increased to the
detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the company was, or because of the transaction became
insolvent, and the favored party knew or ought to have known about the company’s insolvency and the
circumstances that made the transaction improper. Improper behavior is normally related to a breach of the
purpose of insolvency proceedings, which typically is the situation where a creditor should have realized that a
given transaction would deprive the other creditors of their right to fulfilment of their claims.

The usual hardening period is three months prior to the filing date, which is extended to up to 24 months
for transactions with parties closely related to the company. The general avoidance rule (as described above)
provides for an unlimited avoidance period with respect to improper transactions, only provided that the
insolvency existing at the time of the improper transaction caused the later bankruptcy.

**_Legal Position of Unsecured Claims and Priority of Claims_**

Creditors believing to have a claim against the debtor or the bankruptcy estate must prove their claims
and accompany their proofs of claim by adequate documentation. The trustee registers all claims and examines
whether they are legitimate and entitle the creditor to receive dividend.

The ranking of creditors is described in the Bankruptcy Act and it indicates the order in which claims
against the estate or the debtor are settled. All higher ranking claims must be satisfied in full before the next rank
will be entitled to dividend. The ranking of creditors is as follows:

    - First: claims in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings or claims according to agreements
affirmed by the bankruptcy trustee;

    - Second: claims in connection with any prior restructuring proceedings;

    - Third: claims for wages or salaries payable;

    - Fourth: claims of suppliers for certain indirect taxes;

    - Fifth: simple, unsecured claims (all other claims except for deferred claims); and

    - Sixth: deferred claims (interest accruing after the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings,
fines, liquidated damages, promises of gifts and subordinated loan capital).

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Danish companies and their foreign subsidiaries are generally prohibited from granting (i) loans to and/or
guarantees or security interests in respect of obligations of among others, their direct and indirect parent companies
which are not limited liability companies incorporated in a jurisdiction which is a member of the EU or European
Economic Area or Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Chile, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, South
Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, United Kingdom or USA and (ii) loans and or guarantees or security in connection
with the financing or refinancing of the direct or indirect acquisition of their own shares or shares in their direct
or indirect parent companies. Any such loan, guarantee or security will generally be invalid and unenforceable.


-----

Danish law may limit the ability of a Danish guarantor to guarantee or provide security for the Notes to
the extent that the risk of issuing the guarantee or providing the security is not balanced against the corporate
benefit (financial, commercial, strategic or otherwise) obtained by a Danish guarantor from the issuance of the
Notes.

Claims may become barred under Danish statutes of limitation or principles of passivity or may become
subject to set-off or counterclaim and a guarantee in favor of a Danish credit institution may not be enforceable
unless a claim has been made under the guarantee within six months after the due date of the guaranteed obligation.

**_Perfection of Security Interests_**

The collateral governed by Danish law will be granted and perfected, inter alia, in favor of the holders
of the Notes represented by the Security Agent. The Danish Capital Markets Act allows representatives to hold
security on behalf of noteholders and the Security Agent will be appointed as representative pursuant to the Danish
Capital Markets Act and, in accordance therewith, should be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory
Authority to ensure effective representation in case guarantees or security are granted by or over Danish
companies.

The collateral governed by Danish law will be perfected in favor of the Security Agent and some of the
collateral may only be perfected after the occurrence of certain events of default. Absent perfection, the holder of
the security interest may not be able to enforce its rights in the collateral against third parties, including a
bankruptcy administrator and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. Moreover, if
perfection occurs only after the occurrence of certain events of default it will entail a hardening period.

A Danish court may find that a security interest in dividend rights and voting rights granted pursuant to
a share pledge agreement has not been perfected until the parties secured by the share pledge have given notice to
the relevant company that the voting rights and dividend rights pledged under the share pledge agreement may be
exercised only by the secured parties or a security agent acting on their behalf. Upon perfection, the security
interest in dividend rights and voting rights may be deemed to be security for pre-existing debt and, thus, as
regards those rights be subject to a three months’ hardening period following perfection.

Under Danish law, perfection of assignments of receivables requires (i) notice of assignment to the
relevant debtor of the receivables and (ii) effective control over the cash flows from the receivables. If both of
these requirements are not met (e.g., due to the assignor being permitted to receive payments under assigned
receivables until an event of default), such assignment would be subject to avoidance as further described above
from the time perfection is obtained.

Under Danish law, the ranking of security rights is determined by the date on which the relevant act of
perfection has been taken, and if a security interest created later in time over that same collateral, but in respect
of which the act of perfection is completed prior to perfection of the pre-existing security interest then the security
interest created later will have priority.

**_Parallel Debt and Trusts_**

The concept of parallel debt arrangements is not generally recognized under Danish law and any
agreement or document may not be enforceable to the extent it purports to effect such arrangements. It is uncertain
whether Danish law recognizes the concept of trusts, and provisions in documents which intend to create a trust
may not be enforceable.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under the Danish Bankruptcy Act, claims must be converted into DKK at the exchange rate at the day
the bankruptcy court issued a bankruptcy order over the company.

**Finland**

Some of the Guarantors are limited liability companies incorporated under the laws of Finland (each, a
“Finnish Guarantor”). The following summary highlights certain aspects of (i) the Finnish regulations in respect
of insolvency proceedings, (ii) Finnish fraudulent conveyance laws, (iii) the laws of Finland relating to guarantees
and security granted by Finnish limited liability companies and (iv) creation and enforcement of Finnish law
security, in each case as in force on the date of this offering memorandum.

**_Insolvency_**

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Finnish law. The first, company reorganization (Fi.
_yrityssaneeraus), has the objective of investigating whether the business has a reasonable chance to continue and,_
if so, to rehabilitate the company’s viable business, ensure its continued viability and make arrangements with
creditors. The second, bankruptcy (Fi. konkurssi), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a
debtor to its creditors.

_Company Reorganization_

If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is probable that a company
reorganization will remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than for a short period, an
application for company reorganization can be made to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors in
accordance with the Finnish Company Reorganization Act (47/1993, as amended, Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta)
(the “Company Reorganization Act”). Further, the initiation of company reorganization proceedings is
possible—in theory, irrespective of the company’s solvency situation—when at least two creditors whose total
claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint
application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company reorganization. If
there are no specific legal barriers to company reorganization and, consequently, the court approves the application
and opens company reorganization proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint an administrator (Fi.
_selvittäjä). The board of directors and the managing director continue to act on behalf of the company during the_
reorganization proceedings. The reorganization administrator is entitled to review the company’s books and
business documents, obtain any information on the company’s business activities, as well as to participate in
meetings of the debtor’s corporate bodies.

All existing claims against the company are suspended as of the commencement of the company
reorganization. The suspension as a main rule prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment
and enforcement of the debts that have fallen due before the commencement of the reorganization program
(although debts arising after the filing of the company reorganization application can be repaid and enforced) and
the seizure of assets. The suspensions are in force until the company reorganization program has been confirmed
by the district court or the proceedings have been dismissed.

Creditors with equal ranking have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts within
the company reorganization program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Company Reorganization Act,
the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the company reorganization program:
(i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first,
and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second; (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other
credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reduce the outstanding principal balance of
unpaid debt. The company reorganization program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt.
Consequently, the company reorganization procedure could result in holders of the notes receiving a right to
recover considerably less than they would otherwise be entitled to recover under the guarantee granted by the
Finnish Guarantor.

Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties)
security interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, insofar as the value of the security
at the commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim
after the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority, i.e. the amount of the creditor’s claim
exceeding the value of the security does not qualify as secured debt but, instead, will constitute unsecured debt
and may, thus be subject to the measures described above.

The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii)
order that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit
costs second; or (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term
of the debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest,
the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate
security.

Payments on a secured debt shall be determined so that at least the present value of the secured debt will
be repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the
consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed one-half of the original
credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, a court will take into consideration the length of the


-----

remaining credit period, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and
credit costs.

_Bankruptcy_

A debtor or its qualifying creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a bankruptcy court of competent
jurisdiction when the debtor has failed to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary. If the application
is approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) of the bankruptcy estate (Fi. pesänhoitaja)
will be appointed by the court.

A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the
debtor and use the proceeds received therefrom in payment of the creditors’ claims. In order to achieve the
objective of bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of
the estate administrator. The creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator
must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors
in matters falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors.

As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in
writing (a “claim letter”), by delivering it to the estate administrator no later than the deadline set by the estate
administrator. If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, a value in euro for the purposes of the
bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy
proceedings. The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a creditor with a secured
claim and a creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor.

Creditors have an equal right to a payment from the funds of the bankruptcy estate in the proportion of
the amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, creditors of the administrative expenses
of the bankruptcy estate, creditors with claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the
debtor) has entered into and any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law have
precedence over all other creditors to receive their claims. Further, according to the Finnish Act on Ranking of
Claims (1578/1992, as amended, _Laki velkojien maksunsaantijärjestyksestä), the following creditors have_
precedence over unsecured creditors to receive their claims: (i) secured creditors and holders of retention rights
have priority to the proceeds, including interest accrued during a period of up to three years prior to the
commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings, and relating to the relevant asset; (ii) creditors of a debt that has
arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of company reorganization proceedings; and (iii) creditors
with claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive prior to other claims a disbursement of 50% of
the net proceeds of the mortgaged assets (after the claims of creditors with a better priority position have been
satisfied). The rights of the above-mentioned preferential creditors may adversely affect the interests of holders
of the notes. Bankruptcy of a Finnish Guarantor could result in holders of the notes recovering less than they
would have otherwise been entitled to recover under the guarantee granted by such Finnish Guarantor.

Finnish law prescribes claims that are to be settled lastly. In practice, the most significant of such claims
are the interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the bankruptcy, and
certain bonds and loans which are under their terms subordinated to the claims of all other creditors of the debtor.
The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy
estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds.
However, secured creditors that are secured pursuant to a fixed charge over movable or immovable property may
exercise their right to enforce such collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may
at its own discretion prohibit the sale for a maximum of two months.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

Pursuant to the Finnish Act on Recovery to the Bankruptcy Estate (758/1991, as amended, _Laki_
_takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään) (the “Recovery Act”), certain acts performed by a debtor can be revoked if_
the rights of creditors have been prejudiced by those acts. According to the Company Reorganization Act and the
Finnish Enforcement Code (705/2007, as amended, _Ulosottokaari), the grounds for recovery set forth in the_
Recovery Act are also to be applied in company reorganization and enforcement proceedings.

The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator in the company reorganization and certain
creditors may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company reorganization or
enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for
recovery against the debtor’s counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. In bankruptcy, this


-----

period to file an action is one year from the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three months from
the moment that the bankruptcy estate has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. In the case
of a company reorganization program, the administrator must file an action within six months from the
commencement of the reorganization proceedings or within three months from the moment that the administrator
has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery.

Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a
debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction
concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or
enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may
be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a
creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of other creditors, or (c) increases
debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the
transaction became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the
characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty of the transaction knew or should have known of the
insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv)
the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the
transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers
all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had
qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions
between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (as defined in the
Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction and such persons are assumed to have
had knowledge of the issues described above in (i) and (ii).

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless
of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction.
Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of
debts; and (iii) the granting of security. Payment received by a creditor through enforcement effected by the
relevant authority later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company
reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the
debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the
date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant
authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years)
may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the
amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be
recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given
later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement
is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s
sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in
connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any
similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit.

A gift or a transaction considered to be a gift may be recovered under Section 6 of the Recovery Act if it
has been concluded within one year prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization
or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority. The aforesaid time limit is extended to three years if
the parties are related persons (as defined in the Recovery Act) and the debtor was, at the time of the gift or a
contract with the characteristics of a gift, or partly due to the transaction became, over-indebted. A contract may
be considered to have characteristics of a gift if the benefit incurred by one party is substantially disproportionate
to the value of the contract. Some Finnish legal scholars have supported the view that a guarantee or third party
security could be recovered in accordance with the provisions regulating recovery of a gift but there is no clear
consensus on this matter.

When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the
bankruptcy estate or the debtor. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that had been
paid for the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that
paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation
to return the compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable,
compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause
inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the
value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to
compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable property.


-----

Accordingly, the validity of the guarantee in respect of the Notes or any payment made thereunder may
be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. If the granting of a guarantee or a payment
thereunder is successfully challenged, then the granting of such guarantee could be nullified or the payment
recovered. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of a guarantee
granted by the Finnish Guarantor, and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with
respect to such guarantee could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and security_**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Finnish Companies Act (624/2006, as amended, Osakeyhtiölaki) (the
“Finnish Companies Act”) a Finnish company may not provide financing for, or grant guarantees or security to
secure the financing of, the acquisition of its or its parent company’s shares (financial assistance). While the matter
is not entirely clear under Finnish law, the view among some Finnish scholars seems to be that the financing of
an acquisition of shares in a foreign direct or indirect holding company would fall outside the scope of the beforementioned prohibition provided that such foreign parent company is not a member of a group of companies
controlled by a qualifying Finnish legal entity but the prohibition of financial assistance may well apply fully to
all direct and indirect parent companies of a Finnish Guarantor, including foreign companies.

Further, a company can only distribute its assets in the ways specified in the Finnish Companies Act.
Other transactions that reduce the assets of the company or increase its liabilities without a sound business reason
constitute unlawful distribution of assets. If a company undertakes a transaction with or for the benefit of a direct
or indirect parent company or another related party on terms that deviate to the detriment of the company from
arms’ length terms, then this may be construed as unlawful profit distribution. Granting of guarantees and security
requires that the granting of guarantee/security is based on sound business reasons (corporate benefit). The
business justification for granting the guarantee/security is assessed on a company-level and on a stand-alone
basis, without regard to any group benefit (synergies and the like can be taken into account to the extent they
create direct benefits, such as cost savings, to the company). In the context of the guarantee/security in respect of
the Notes, the assessment of business justification should take into consideration also, among other things, other
guarantees and security granted or to be granted by the Finnish Guarantor for the other financing arrangements of
the Group.

For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements,
guarantees and security documents to include language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security
granted by limited liability companies incorporated in Finland is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict
with the relevant statutory limitations. In line with this practice, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and
the relevant security documents and the Note Guarantee granted by a Finnish Guarantor will contain such
limitation language and thus be so limited. By operation of such limitation, the beneficiaries of the guarantee agree
to enforce the guarantee against any Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in
a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that Finnish Guarantor. The actual scope
of the guarantee by the Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of
liabilities expressed to be guaranteed and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish
law relating to unlawful profit distribution, as applied to the guarantee, no liabilities or obligations will under
Finnish law, be held to be effectively guaranteed.

The terms of the security documents granted by the Finnish Guarantor limit enforcement in all material
respects in the same manner and to the same extent as the abovementioned limitations in respect of the payment
obligations under the Finnish Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The Revolving Credit Facility contains a substantially
similar limitation, but due to the different uses of the proceeds of the financings, the actual application of the
limitation may lead to a different outcome in relation to the Revolving Credit Facility than in relation to the Notes.
In addition to the corporate benefit requirement and the financial assistance prohibition, the granting of the
guarantee/security has to be within the limits of the company’s business purpose (as set out in its articles of
association).

**_Creation of a valid security interest_**

Other than in respect of the creation of registered mortgages over assets belonging to certain specific
asset classes (such as real estate, qualifying vehicles and intellectual property rights) capable of being the subject
of registered security, the creation of a valid and enforceable security interest under Finnish law is achieved by
pledging the security assets and perfecting such pledge, typically by transferring such security assets into the
exclusive physical possession of the pledgee. In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must be
effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in


-----

possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose
of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created
until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event. Perfection cannot be achieved
once insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible and be set aside in insolvency
proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time before the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

**_Enforcement of security_**

The pledge of most movable assets (such as shares) may be enforced without a court judgment or the
involvement of an enforcement official or, should the pledgee deem it necessary, through official enforcement. A
pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale and a pledge of receivables either by selling the receivable
or by the secured creditor collecting payment of the receivable. Typically collection of receivables directly from
the debtors of the pledgor results in more expedient and profitable outcome than a sale of the receivables, both of
which are forms of self-enforcement. In case the debtor does not pay the debts in the due time, the pledgee has
the possibility to file a claim to the District Court in order to obtain a summary judgment, which can be used as
grounds for official enforcement.

The Finnish Commercial Code (3/1734, as amended, Kauppakaari) stipulates a default process in respect
of an enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default
process. The parties’ discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory
invalidity of a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically
transfer to the pledgee (however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce the
security, effectively agree that an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming ownership of
the pledged asset), and (b) by the pledgee always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of the pledgor and
other creditors of the pledgor are not unduly jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee.

**Sweden**

**_Applicable Insolvency Law_**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden and as such any insolvency
proceedings applicable to such Guarantor, including any and all of its assets (in Sweden and abroad), will, as a
matter of Swedish law, be governed by Swedish insolvency law (lex fori concursus).

In addition, a Swedish party will in principle be subject to insolvency proceedings covered by the EU
Insolvency Regulation (which includes all collective insolvency proceedings available under Swedish law in
respect of bodies corporate) if it has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in Sweden. The COMI is presumed,
in the case of a company or body corporate, to be the place of its registration as a legal person. Accordingly, if the
Swedish party is registered in Sweden, Swedish courts will be entitled to open main insolvency proceedings
against it and apply the laws of the relevant insolvency proceedings. If the COMI of a debtor is in a Member State
(other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State
(other than Denmark) may open “territorial insolvency proceedings” or, after the commencement of main
proceedings, “secondary insolvency proceedings,” in the event that such debtor possesses an “establishment” in
the territory of such other Member State.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

In the event of bankruptcy the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy who will work in the interests
of all creditors with the objective of selling the debtor’s assets and distributing the proceeds among the creditors.

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s
creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to
safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all
creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and
to distribute the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company
and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or
dispose of the company’s assets.

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights
of Priority Act (Sw. förmånsrättslagen 1970:979), as amended from time to time, which states the order in which
creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have an


-----

equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However, preferential
or secured creditors have the benefit of payment before other creditors.

In the case of enforcement outside bankruptcy, an enforcement process is initiated by the creditor
obtaining an enforcement order from the Swedish Enforcement Authority or the court. Upon obtaining an
enforcement order against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement
of its claim. If agreed upon between a pledgor and a secured creditor and the secured creditor or its agent is in
physical possession of the security assets, the agent may under certain circumstances enforce the pledge without
the involvement of the Swedish Enforcement Authority or a court. A provision granting the secured party or its
agent such right of enforcement is typically included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured
party or its agent.

**_Priority of Certain Creditors_**

As a general principle, under Swedish insolvency law competing claims have equal right to payment in
relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However, some preferential and secured
creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law, have the benefit of payment before
other creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights. Specific
preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor a right to payment from such property.
General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent company’s estate in bankruptcy, which is
not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment from such property. Claims
that do not carry any of the above mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for
such claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other.

**_Challengeable Transactions_**

In bankruptcy and company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and
subject to a time limit) be reversed and the goods or monies can then be returned to the bankruptcy estate or the
company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations in
which the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other
creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest, granted a
guarantee or security that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected
without delay after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that
is considerable compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of
payment.

In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during
the three months preceding the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In certain situations,
longer time limits apply and in others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the
other party to an agreement or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor such as a
subsidiary or parent company.

**_Limitations on Enforceability Due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_**

The Reorganization Act (Sw. _Lag om företagsrekonstruktion 1996:764) provides companies facing_
difficulty in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve them without being declared
bankrupt. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from
commencement but may, and often is, extended for several additional three-month-periods.

An administrator is appointed by the court and supervises the day to day activities and safeguards the
interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except
that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of reorganization, granting
security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting
rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required.
However, if the debtor fails to comply with the restrictions it does not affect the validity of such actions.

The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts with the debtor
but the Reorganization Act contains specific rules that restrict termination of contracts due to breaches of
contractual obligations that occurred prior to the instigation of the reorganization and, during the reorganization
procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the procedure
includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that fell due prior to the order


-----

without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons
for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to
execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the
security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor,
which is the case with a share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share
certificates of such company has been delivered to the agent or with a Swedish law pledge over a loan which is
documented by a negotiable debt instrument (Sw. löpande skuldebrev).

The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (Sw. offentligt ackord),
which means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public composition must
meet certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors that are allowed to vote, in respect
of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set
off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set
off rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will,
however, be part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The
public composition is binding on the proceedings.

**_Limitations on the Value of a Guarantee or Security Interest_**

_Corporate Benefit Rules_

If a Swedish limited liability company provides any security interest or guarantee without receiving
sufficient corporate benefit in return, such security interest or guarantee will, according to the Swedish Companies
Act (aktiebolagslagen 2005:551) (the “Swedish Companies Act”), in whole or in part, be considered a
distribution of assets, which will be lawful only to the extent that there is sufficient coverage for the unrestricted
equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company (a “Swedish Company”) after the distribution (i.e., at the
time the guarantee is provided or the security is granted).

The Note Guarantees of and security granted by the Guarantors incorporated in Sweden are limited in
accordance with the above restrictions relating to corporate benefit and are subject to limitation language limiting
the liability of such entities thereunder if required by the above restrictions relating to distribution of assets.

_Financial Assistance_

Further, the Swedish Companies Act prohibits a Swedish Company from providing a loan or a guarantee
or security interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Swedish Company itself
or in any other member of the same Swedish group of companies (with the exception of its subsidiaries) and,
subject to certain exceptions, a Swedish Company may not provide a guarantee or any security for the obligations
of a parent or sister company, unless the parent company of the group, to which the company and such parent or
sister company belongs, is domiciled within the EEA.

**_Creation of Valid Security Interests_**

In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law, the property subject to such security interest
must fulfil the following criteria: (a) there must be an underlying debtor-creditor relationship in respect of the
obligations which the security purports to secure; (b) the pledgor must grant the security interest, typically in the
form of a pledge agreement; and (c) an act perfecting the security interest must take place. The method for
perfection varies depending on the asset type.

Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the
secured party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of
its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests
purported to be created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of,
retain exclusive control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence
of an enforcement event would therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security
interests have been perfected. Such unperfected secured assets are vulnerable under applicable provisions of
Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security
provider. Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the
secured assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over an asset in connection with
the disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at risk of impairing the validity of
the security.


-----

**_Foreign Currency_**

Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than the local currency but the judgment debtor
has the right under Swedish law to pay the judgment debt, even though denominated in a foreign currency, in the
local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

**_Security Granted in Favor of an Agent_**

It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf
of the secured parties. However, it is not established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power of
attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent (including any agent for service of
process), can be made irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and
will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving
such powers. The concept of trust does not exist under Swedish law and unless the trustee is treated as the agent
of the secured parties, the security will be invalid should Swedish law be deemed applicable.

**_Limitations on guarantees and security—financial assistance_**

A Norwegian company’s legal capacity or ability to provide financial assistance (including placing funds
at disposal, granting loans, or providing security or guarantees) may be limited by applicable law, including, but
not limited to the mandatory provisions of section 8-7 and 8-10 of the Norwegian Limited Companies Act
(aksjeloven) (the “Norwegian Companies Act”). If any of these limitations apply to the financial assistance, such
financial assistance (in whole or in part) may be deemed invalid and the value of e.g. the underlying guarantee or
security interest may be significantly reduced or fall away all together.

Section 8-7 restricts a Norwegian company’s ability to grant financial assistance in favor of its (direct or
indirect) parent company or any of its affiliates out of its distributable reserves unless such financial assistance
falls within one or more of the exemptions listed in section 8-7 (3). These exemptions include, inter alia, financial
assistance granted by a Norwegian company to (i) its Norwegian incorporated parent company or Norwegian
incorporated group companies or (ii) to any other company who has decisive influence over the Norwegian
company or subsidiaries of such company provided that such financial assistance serves the economic interest of
the group of companies.

Pursuant to section 8-10 (1) of the Norwegian Companies Act, a Norwegian company may, as a starting
point, only provide financial assistance in connection with the acquisition of its own or its direct or indirect parent
company’s shares out of its distributable reserves. As of 1 January 2020 the regulations were amended to permit
financial assistance where the acquirer will form part of the company’s group following the acquisition (i.e.
acquirer following the acquisition will have decisive influence over the Norwegian company (i.e. typically having,
as a result of an agreement or by the ownership of shares or other ownership interests in the other company
(directly or indirectly), (i) a majority of the voting rights in the company, or (ii) a right to elect or remove a
majority of the membes of the board of directors of the company) subject to the following conditions:

    - the acquirer is domiciled in an EU/EEA-country;

    - the financial assistance is provided on commercial terms and principles and relate to fully paid-in
shares;

    - the financial assistance is approved by the board of directors and shareholder meeting of the
company before the financial assistance is provided;

    - the board makes an assessment of the creditworthiness of the beneficiary of the financial
assistance;

    - the board prepares a report which inter alia include the background for the proposal, terms related
thereto, the price to be paid for the shares, an assessment of the company’s interest in providing
the financial assistance and the consequences as to the equity and liquidity of the company;

    - the board shall confirm that it is in the company’s interest to make the assistance and that the
company will meet its legal requirements to sound equity and liquidity; and


-----

    - the report and the confirmation must be enclosed with the summons to the shareholder meeting
referred to above and will be public and shall without undue delay be filed with the Norwegian
Business Register before the financial assistance is provided.

The principle of corporate benefit also exists in Norway and may, inter alia, impose a restriction on a
Norwegian company’s ability to offer a guarantee and provide security to or in favour of shareholders or parties
related to a shareholder in addition to the restrictions on financial assistance and upstream/cross-stream guarantees
and security described above.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Norwegian courts may award judgment in currencies other than Norwegian Kroner, but the debtor is
nevertheless in relation to such judgment entitled to make payment in Norwegian Kroner at the rate of exchange
prevailing at the date of such payment.

**_Brief and high level description of creation and perfection of security / Enforcement of security in Norway_**

The validity and enforceability of any guarantee or security interest provided by a Norwegian company
will be subject to any Norwegian laws from time to time in effect relating to bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency,
reorganization, administration, moratorium or dissolution and any other laws or legal procedures affecting
creditors’ rights in general, and to any provision generally applicable under Norwegian law with regard to the
invalidation or revision of contracts and/or unfair contract terms. Enforcement of a security interest created under
Norwegian law may only take place in a manner authorized by Norwegian law.

Norwegian law requires a statutory basis for establishing a security interest. The Norwegian Mortgages
and Pledges Act (panteloven) (the “Pledge Act”) is the legal basis for most types of security which can be
established pursuant to Norwegian law. It is a general condition for establishing a security interest that the assets
to be pledged are transferable. The security will only be enforceable against third parties including the bankruptcy
estate where the necessary perfection acts have been undertaken. The procedure for perfecting a security interest
varies depending on the type of asset being subject to the security interest. Any security interest in respect of
which legal protection has not been obtained without undue delay following the creation of the debt in respect of
which such security interest was granted, will be held invalid in the event i) that a petition for the bankruptcy or
debt negotiations in respect of the pledgor/assignor has been filed within three months of the obtaining of legal
protection for such security and the pledgor/assignor is declared bankrupt or debt negotiations are initiated as a
consequence of such petition, or ii) that it is found that the obtaining of legally protected security interest at the
time of such obtaining represents an act of ill faith on the part of the relevant creditor in relation to the other
creditors of the pledgor/assignor. Moreover, if the relevant security interest is not perfected, the holder of the
security interest may have difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce such holder’s rights in the relevant
asset in competition with third parties, including an administrator in the bankruptcy and other creditors who claim
a security interest in the same assets. Under Norwegian law, the ranking of security interests is determined by the
date on which they were perfected. A security interest created on a later date over the same assets, but which was
perfected at an earlier time, generally has priority.

As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement
situation and agreements on enforcement cannot be validly entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of
default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts or the Norwegian enforcement
authorities.

For specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly
enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade
receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the
outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of the chargor.

The concept of a security trustee, as understood under U.S. law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In
Norway a security trustee would be considered to be acting as a security agent. In practice in Norway, in an
arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time to time, it is
generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf of
the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding
a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor the security agent may be required to disclose
to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or participate as claimants in the proceedings.
It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond trustee for an undisclosed number of


-----

noteholders can, based on the provisions in the relevant bond agreement or indenture, take legal action against the
issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the holders of the Notes without having to disclose the identity of the holders of
the Notes. However, the relevant Norwegian court would have to examine the relevant indenture together with
the other relevant agreements relating to the Notes and this Offering to determine whether the trustee would be
able to act in such capacity.

**_Limitations on guarantees and security—other limitations_**

A bankruptcy estate and any entity providing financing of debt reorganization under the Norwegian
Temporary Act on Reorganization to Mitigate Economic Hardship Resulting from COVID-19
(Rekonstruksjonsloven) (the “Temporary Reorganization Act”) has a first priority mortgage right against each
asset being mortgaged to a third party as security for the obligations of the bankruptcy estate of up to 5% of the
value of such asset. Such mortgage rights are to secure necessary costs related to the bankruptcy proceedings and
to secure loans granted to finance debt reorganization proceedings. Under Norwegian law such mortgage rights
are applicable also in respect of cross collateral arrangements, and such mortgage rights may increase accordingly
as a result thereof. Such statory lien is not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments)
established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act (Lov om finansiell sikkehetsstillese) (the “Financial
Collateal Act”), cf. the Norwegian Pledge Act Section 6-4 (9).

The security granted by a Norwegian company might be subject to defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections which could adversely affect the value of the security and the ability to enforce or realize the
security. Furthermore, the ranking of security interest can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among
others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of
certain jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the assets over which a Norwegian company grants a security
are, or will be, free and clear from third-party prior ranking security rights or other interests arising by operation
of law.

According to the Norwegian Enforcement Act (tvangsfullbyrdelsesloven), enforcement of claims is
contingent upon the existence of an enforcement basis (tvangsgrunnlag), which may require a relevant party to
obtain a court judgment, arbitral award or similar decisions. Obtaining such awards may be a lengthy and costly
process. A Norwegian court may reject a mere technical or minor default under an agreement without a payment
default as a proper basis for execution, unless the relevant event of default is held to be material. Enforcement of
rights under Norwegian law may furthermore be or become limited by prescription, lapse of time or barred under
the Norwegian Limitation Act, and claims under a document may become subject to set-off, counterclaim or other
defences.

Furthermore, the Financial Agreements Act (finansavtaleloven) include certain provisions applicable to
a company incorporated in Norway when granting security and guarantees for the debt of other parties and, inter
alia, requires that a maximum amount is specified in respect of each security interest and guarantee.

A company’s ability to grant security may also be restricted by the relevant company’s constitutional
documents and, in the case of a share pledge, the articles of association of the company’s whose shares are subject
to security.

**_Insolvency_**

The primary legislation on insolvency and bankruptcy in Norway is found in the Norwegian Act on Debt
Arrangement and Bankruptcy (konkursloven) (the “Bankruptcy Act”) and the Norwegian Act on Creditors’
Recovery (dekningsloven) (the “Recovery Act”). It is a formal requirement for the opening of bankruptcy
proceedings that that a company (or person) is insolvent, meaning that the debtor is both illiquid (i.e., the company
is unable to pay its obligations as they come due) and with negative net assets (i.e. the value of the company’s
assets is lower than its debt).

Financial institutions licensed under the Norwegian Financial Undertakings Act dated 10 April 2015 are
exempted from the Bankruptcy Act and subject to special provision implementing the Banking Recovery and
Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (“BRRD”). Companies comprised by the Norwegian Financial Undertakings
Act include (i) banks, (ii) credit/mortgage providers, (iii) financing companies, (iv) insurance companies, (v)
pension companies and (vi) parent companies in financial groups.

Further, relevant rules are laid down in the Temporary Reorganization Act.


-----

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Upon receipt of a petition for bankruptcy proceedings from the company’s board or a creditor, the court
shall make an appraisal of the company’s economic situation, taking into account all relevant factors in the
particular case. The company shall be deemed insolvent if the value of the company’s debt exceeds the value of
the company’s assets and the company is unable to pay its debts when due (unless the company’s inability to pay
its debts is temporary), cf. the above statements on “Insolvency.”

Once the company is declared bankrupt, the court shall appoint a bankruptcy administrator (bostyrer).
The bankruptcy administrator shall manage the bankruptcy estate in the manner most beneficial to both secured
and unsecured creditors and take all measures to ensure a swift and advantageous realization of the assets of the
company. Hence, the primary objective of the bankruptcy administrator will, under Norwegian law, be to realize
all assets, distribute the proceeds to the creditors and dissolve and de-register the company. The company will
cease to exist after bankruptcy has been declared.

The bankruptcy administrator normally sends out an information letter to all known creditors at an early
stage of the bankruptcy proceedings. Further, a public announcement is made in a local newspaper commonly
read in the community where the debtor is located and on the Brønnøysund Register Centre’s website. An initial
meeting of creditors is held in the bankruptcy court, normally within four weeks of the opening of bankruptcy
proceedings. Further court meetings are usually not held and must be requested by the court or the bankruptcy
administrator or a member of the creditors’ committee. Creditors can only request such meetings when they
represent at least one-fifth of the creditors, both with regard to number and amount.

As a general rule, the bankruptcy estate seizes all assets and rights of the company at the time the
company was declared bankrupt, and all assets acquired thereafter, as well as any assets that can be recovered by
the bankruptcy administration. The rights of the bankruptcy estate include the right to sell the assets, continue the
business, enter into or start legal proceedings to obtain assets, reverse transactions (under specific circumstances)
and enter into various types of agreements.

Norwegian bankruptcy legislation has rules whereby certain transactions by the debtor made within a
certain period of time prior to the opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be avoided/reversed. A distinction can
be made between objective and subjective rules. Objective rules apply to transactions regardless of whether the
company was insolvent at the time of the transaction and whether the company or the counterparty can be
reproached for having entered into the transaction. In the main, only transactions entered into within a three-month
period prior to the bankruptcy proceeding can be set aside, according to an objective rule. The objective rules
apply to, for example, gift transactions, security for older debt and extraordinary payments (such as payments
before due time, payments made by unusual means or payments that have considerably weakened the company’s
ability to meet payments). Pursuant to the subjective rule a transaction which improperly (i) gives preference to
one creditor at the expense of the others, (ii) prevents the debtor's assets from being used to cover the creditor's
claims, or (iii) increases the debtor's liabilities in a manner which is detrimental to the creditors, may be avoided
if the debtor's financial situation was weak or became seriously weakened by the transaction. A condition to the
application of the rule is that the other party knew or should have known of the debtor's financial difficulties and
the circumstances which rendered the transaction improper. The subjective rule applies to transactions made 10
years prior to the bankruptcy.

Pursuant to the Temporary Reorganization Act, debtors that are facing or that in the near future will face serious
economic problems may petition to the court for the commencement of debt negotiation proceedings. The goal
of such proceedings is to enable the debtor to restructure its debts, following either unanimous creditor consent
(“Unanimous Reorganization”) or consent from a requisite majority of the creditors affected (a “Non**unanimous Reorganization”). The commencement of reorganization proceedings results in the appointment of**
a reorganization official and a creditor committee that together form a reorganization committee. The
reorganization committee is charged with supervising the debtor during the proceedings and assisting it with
putting forward a reorganization proposal to its creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the enforcement rights
of creditors are suspended during the proceedings.

A debtor in reorganization proceedings has certain possibilities for securing new financing with security
interests over its assets that rank ahead of existing security interests. First, the debtor may, subject to the consent
of the reorganization committee, offer superpriority security interests over its plant and machinery, inventory
and trade receivables to lenders financing the continuation of the debtor’s business activities during the
proceedings and the associated expenses. There is no numerical limit to the sums that may be secured on a
superpriority basis, but existing secured creditors may petition for the reversal of the reorganization committee’s


-----

consent if the superpriority security interest has a material adverse effect on their position. Second, loans
obtained to finance the continuation of the debtor’s business activities during the proceedings and the associated
expenses enjoy a statutory first lien over all of the debtor’s assets. This lien is subject to the same limitations as
the bankruptcy estate’s statutory lien described above.

Assets (including receivables) acquired by a debtor while under reorganisation proceedings will as a
starting point fall outside the scope of existing security interests.

A Unanimous Reorganization may in principle consist of any amendments to the debtor’s debts. The adoption of
a reorganization proposal as Unanimous Reorganization generally requires the consent of all creditors
concerned. However, in the event that no creditors have rejected the proposal following the expiry of a voting
period set by the reorganization official, the proposal will be deemed approved if it has been approved by
creditors representing three-fourths of the claims affected.

The following measures may be imposed as part of a Non-unanimous Reorganization:

    - a rescheduling of the debtor’s payment obligations;

    - a reduction of the debtor’s debts;

    - the conversion of debt to equity capital;

    - the transfer of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets to a purchaser;

    - the transfer and winding up of all the debtor’s business and assets with the debtor being released
from debts exceeding the proceeds of the winding up; and/or

    - a combination of the above measures.

A Non-unanimous Reorganization cannot encroach upon the rights of non-consenting secured creditors,
creditors that enjoy preferential priority in bankruptcy (except for certain tax claims) and creditors with set-off
rights. However, secured claims may be encroached upon if and to the extent the reorganization committee
deems that the claim exceeds the value of the secured assets.

The adoption of a Non-unanimous Reorganization requires the approval of creditors representing a majority of
the claims with voting rights. The claims with voting rights will generally be the claims that are affected by the
proposal.

Following the approval of a requisite majority, a Non-unanimous Reorganization must be sanctioned by
the court. The court may, in addition to reviewing whether procedural requirements have been observed, review
the fairness of the proposal. Such review will take into account whether individual creditors have been
compensated to consent to the reorganization, the burden-sharing among the creditors and whether creditors are
worse off than if the debtor was instead subject to bankruptcy proceedings.

**_Priority of Certain Creditors_**

Under Norwegian bankruptcy law, there are two main groups of priority claims: first priority claims and
second priority claims. First priority claims consist of salary claims within certain time and amount limitations.
Second priority claims consist of certain tax and VAT claims within certain time limitations.

However, none of these claims has priority over secured creditors. Secured creditors are secured up to
the value of the secured property. Exceeding claims are transferred to ordinary unsecured claims. The priority
clauses simply state that first priority claims must be covered in full before any dividend is payable to second
priority claims, and that second priority claims must be covered inn full before any dividend is payable to
unsecured claims.

**_Solvent Enforcement_**

Enforcement of security normally requires that the pledgee or chargee file an application to the
enforcement authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced
without the involvement of the enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the
Financial Collateral Act and charges over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured party such right of
enforcement is typically included in any security agreement between the pledgor/chargor and the secured party.


-----

Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally
binding judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the
creditor may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim.

**GARFUNKELUX HOLDCO 2 S.A.**
**INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Corporate information**

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (together
“The Group”) for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution
of Directors on 19 August 2020. The registered office is located at 488 route de Longwy, in Luxembourg Ville.

The Group is principally engaged in the provision of credit management services. During the 6 month period to
30 June 2020 there were no changes made to the Group structure.

**Basis of preparation**

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2020 have been prepared in
accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted by the European Union.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in
the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual consolidated financial
statements as at 31 December 2019. Selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are
significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual
consolidated financial statements.

The accounting policies applied are consistent with those used in preparing the statutory consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2019.

**General information**

On 17 January 2020, the Group used the availability of its UK securitisation facility to draw down a further £77.9m of
funding.

On 12 February 2020 Lowell entered into a strategic partnership with a global asset manager to jointly acquire consumer
unsecured non-performing loan opportunities across Lowell’s markets. Lowell will act as the asset manager for all of
the acquired assets and it is envisaged that up to €300m of capital will be deployed over the next 3 years with an
inaugural transaction having already been closed in February 2020. The partnership will provide Lowell with an
enhanced ability to continue to meet the needs of our clients, whilst at the same time providing for future servicing
income growth.

During April 2020, the Group drew down €195.4m from the Revolving Credit Facility to utilise the €455m commitment
in full.

In response to the global pandemic of COVID-19 the Group has enacted a number of management actions to support
the continuing operations of the business. These are described in the going concern section.

**Functional and presentation currency**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are prepared in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its “Functional Currency”). For the purposes of these condensed consolidated
financial statements, the results are prepared in Pound Sterling, (the Group’s “Presentational Currency”). All amounts
have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.


-----

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group interim condensed consolidated financial statements consolidate the interim financial statements of
Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. (“the Company”) and all its subsidiary undertakings (together “the Group”) for the
six-month period ending 30 June 2020.

The Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:

- Power over the investee (i.e. existing voting rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of
the investee);

- Exposure, or rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and

- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its return.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support its presumption and when
the Group has less than a majority of voting rights or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts
and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee including:

- The contractual arrangements with the other investee;

- Rights arising from the contractual arrangements; and

- The Group voting rights and potential voting rights.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

**Going concern**

The Group’s business and activities are set out in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
(“SCI”) and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (“SFP”) on pages F-3 and F-4 respectively.

The Group’s result for the six months ended 30 June 2020 was an operating profit of £37.9m (six months ended
30 June 2019: £76.4m) and a net asset position of £94.6m at 30 June 2020 (31 December 2019: £159.6m).

The business as a whole is cash generative before portfolio acquisitions and tax, generating cash of £222.1m in the six
months to 30 June 2020 (six months ended 30 June 2019: £193.1m), with operating cash flow after portfolio acquisitions
and tax being £94.5m (six months ended 30 June 2019: £7.3m). The Group continually monitors its cash flow
requirements to ensure that enough cash is available to meet its commitments.

Although management believe collections have generally shown good resilience since the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic, during Q2 the Group experienced a reduction in back-book collections compared to the Estimated Remaining
Collections (“ERC”) forecast at 31 December 2019. This reduction has been largely driven by management decisions
to temporarily reduce outbound consumer contact activity and pause new legal collections in the UK region.
Management resumed outbound customer contact activity in June and intends to resume new legal collections in the
second half of 2020, with the objective of increasing the Group’s future collections. Management has additional
available actions for cash outflow management which principally include a reduction in portfolio acquisitions together
with cost mitigations, including placing staff in the DACH region on the German short time working scheme
(Kurzarbeit), delaying a number of change projects and reducing other discretionary spend.

In assessing whether the going concern basis is appropriate to adopt, the directors have undertaken a review of forecast
cash flow models and scenarios for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial
statements. These scenarios have been subject to stress testing, and severe but plausible downside scenarios have been
considered, taking into account both the Group’s performance since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the
possibility of a second spike in infections in late-2020. They consider a range of cash flow reductions including smaller
as well as double-digit reductions in collections across the UK, DACH and the Nordics. These scenarios are considered
to be reasonable by management and, after taking management actions as required, the Group maintains sufficient
liquidity and cash reserves to continue as a going concern.


-----

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Going concern (continued)**

The Group has four main sources of funding at 30 June 2020, €365m, £565m, €415m, €530m and SEK1,280m of listed
Senior Secured loan notes (“notes”), £196.5m of listed Senior loan notes, a €455m RCF and a securitisation facility
with an option to reset of £255m. As detailed in note 9, at 30 June 2020, £405.8m was drawn on the RCF and there were
£234.1m of assets in the securitisation facility. There are covenants on the funding which are detailed in note 20 of the
Group’s annual consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2019. No maintenance covenants have been
breached, or are expected to be breached, during the period. The earliest debt maturity horizon is 31 December 2021
and the latest is 10 April 2024, being the RCF and the Securitisation Loan respectively. The Group continues to monitor
its funding requirements and the Directors believe, given the debt maturity horizon, there is sufficient time to extend or
re-negotiate existing facilities, or explore new funding arrangements as appropriate.

At the balance sheet date management assessed that the combined operating cash flows of the Group, together with the
cash resources and borrowings under the RCF, will be sufficient to fund the Group’s debt and tax servicing requirements
as they become due, working capital requirements and anticipated debt purchases. However, the Group’s ability to
obtain funding in the future from these sources will depend on its performance and prospects, as well as other factors
beyond its control, such factors may include weak economic and capital market conditions. An inability to procure
sufficient funding at favourable terms to purchase portfolios as they become available could have an adverse effect on
the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition. As one of a number of mitigating measures, the Group
is focussed on reducing leverage in line with its guidance.

Based on the above the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going
concern basis.

**Foreign currency**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective Functional Currencies of Group entities at the foreign
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the
balance sheet date are retranslated to the Functional Currency at the foreign exchange rate at that date. Foreign exchange
differences arising on translation are recognised in the SCI. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the
Functional Currency at foreign exchange rates at the dates the fair value was determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation,
are translated to the Group’s Presentational Currency (Pound Sterling) at foreign exchange rates at the statement of the
financial position date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period
where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising
from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in
the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be. When a foreign operation is disposed of, such
that control, joint control or significant influence (as the case may be) is lost, the entire accumulated amount in the
Foreign Currency Translation Reserve, net of amounts previously attributed to non-controlling interests, is reclassified
to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary
that includes a foreign operation while still retaining control, the relevant proportion of the accumulated amount is
reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint
venture that includes a foreign operation while still retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant
proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.


-----

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Business combinations**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of completion) of assets given, liabilities incurred
or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. At acquisition,
non-controlling interest (“NCI”) is measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as
incurred.

Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are
adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below).

All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted
for in accordance with relevant IFRS standards. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity
are not recognised.

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under
IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of deferred tax
assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are recognised and measured
in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits) respectively.

On a business combination the portfolio investments are recalculated to fair value using an appropriate discount rate at
the date of acquisition, calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date.

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information
about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year from the
date of acquisition.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition
date), and is allocated to the cash generating units (“CGU’s”) that are expected to benefit from that business
combination. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the
entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Total goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Additionally, if there is evidence of an impairment trigger in any
CGU, goodwill allocated to that CGU is also tested for impairment.

The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs to sell,
and value in use. Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast cash flows,
growth rates, and an appropriate discount rate.

If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the
unit on a pro-rated basis in relation to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the goodwill attributable to that subsidiary is included when calculating the profit or loss
on disposal.


-----

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method**

_Finance revenue on portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments represents the yield from acquired portfolio investments, net of VAT where
applicable. Acquired portfolio investments are held to collect contractual cash flows of payments of solely principal and
interest, recognising them at amortised cost and in line with IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”).

The effective interest rate (“EIR”) is the rate that exactly discounts the day one estimated future cash receipts of the
acquired portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition, (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). These
estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the estimated remaining life of the portfolios and range from 84 months
to 120 months.

Acquired portfolio investments are acquired at a deep discount and classified as purchased or originated credit impaired
(“POCI”) in line with IFRS 9. As a result the estimated future cash flows, and hence EIR, reflect the expected lifetime
credit losses within each portfolio.

Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cash flows be deemed greater than previous
estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period to derive future cash receipts. The difference in carrying value
following an enhanced collection forecast is recognised in the net portfolio write up or write down line within income,
with subsequent reversals also recorded in this line. This line represents the net impairment gains on portfolio
investments.

As part of the acquisition accounting around the purchase of Metis Bidco Limited by Simon Bidco Limited on
13 October 2015 the portfolio investments were uplifted to their fair value at the date of acquisition. The portfolio fair
value release represents the unwinding of this fair value uplift. This uplift is being unwound in line with the standard
profile of a gross ERC curve of these portfolios.

_Service revenue_

Service revenue represents amounts receivable for tracing and debt collecting services (commissions and fees) provided
to third party clients including collection lawyers, net of VAT where applicable. Performance obligations within service
contracts are the collection of cash and hence these are satisfied when the Group collects on debt. Payment is due from
clients shortly after cash is collected on their behalf. Revenue is recognised when performance obligations are satisfied.

_Impairment of acquired portfolio investments_

Acquired portfolio investments are reviewed for indications of impairment in accordance with the IFRS 9 forward
looking expected credit loss (“ECL”) model. As the Group’s portfolio investments are classified as POCI assets, lifetime
ECL is included in the calculation of EIR. The estimation of ECL includes an assessment of forward-looking economic
assumptions. Impairment represents changes to carrying values, discounted at the EIR, of the portfolio investments as
a result of reassessments of the estimated future cash flows. These are recognised in net portfolio write up or write down
in the SCI.

The impairment adjustment is calculated by discounting regularly revised cash flow forecasts developed for each
individual portfolio investment, at the initially set EIR. The cash flow forecasts, which represent the undiscounted value
of the ERC of the Group’s portfolio investments at a given point in time, are calculated over the portfolio expected
useful life, based on previous month’s collections and portfolio performance information collated within our proprietary
valuation models.


-----

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Condensed Consolidated SFP when the Group
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

_Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”)_

This category relates to financial assets and liabilities that are required to be recognised at fair value through profit or
loss. Such assets or liabilities are initially recognised at cost, which at this point equates to fair value. They must be
measured subsequently at fair value.

The main assets and liabilities in the Group falling into this category are derivative financial instruments that do not fall
under the scope of hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9.

_Loans and receivables_

Acquired portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value. The
portfolios are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the EIR method.

The portfolio investment is analysed between current and non-current in the SFP. The current asset is determined using
the expected cash flows arising in the next twelve months after the SFP date. The residual amount is classified as noncurrent.

Portfolio investments include litigation costs which represent upfront fees paid during the litigation process, expected
to be recoverable from the customer and added to the customer account balance to be recovered at a later date.

_Loans and receivables (continued)_

Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market are classified as ‘Trade and other receivables’. Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using
the EIR method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for
short-term receivables (including trade receivables) when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.

The Group has forward flow agreements in place in relation to the future acquisition of portfolio investments. The fair
value and subsequent amortised cost of portfolios acquired under these agreements are determined on the same basis as
the Group’s other portfolio investments.

_Impairment of financial assets_

Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at
each period end. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events
that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have
been affected.

_Financial liabilities and equity_

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of
the contractual arrangement.

_Financial liabilities_

All financial liabilities held by the Group are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, except for those
measured at fair value through the SCI, e.g. derivative liabilities. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and
only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.


-----

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Collection activity costs**

Collection activity costs represents direct staff costs and the direct third party costs incurred in providing services as a
debt collection agency or collecting debts on acquired portfolio investments; examples include printing and postage,
third party commissions, search and trace costs, litigation, telephone and SMS costs.

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

_Current tax_

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in
the SCI because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end.

_Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the
initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each SFP date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset
is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the SFP date. Deferred tax is
charged or credited in the SCI, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.


-----

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, if
it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and if a reliable estimate of the amount of the
obligation can be made.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation
at the SFP date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the discounted present value of
those cash flows.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party,
a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the
receivable can be measured reliably.

**Cash and equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits with a term from inception of three months or less,
less bank overdrafts where there is a right to offset. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that
there is no right to offset with cash balances in the same currency.

The Group holds cash on behalf of third parties as part of its collection activities and securitisation facilities. The
restricted cash is shown within cash with a corresponding liability recognised in other payables. Total restricted cash as
at 30 June 2020 was £66.9m (31 December 2019: £61.5m).

**Share-based Payments**

Some employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments
settled by the main shareholder of the Group as described in note 11.

IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires an entity to account for a transaction in which it either:

- receives goods or services when another entity in the same group (or a shareholder of any group entity) has the
obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction, or

- has an obligation to settle a share-based payment transaction when another entity in the same group receives the
goods or services

unless the transaction is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the entity receiving
them.

_Equity-settled transactions_

To the extent a cost is recognised, the cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when
the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model.

The cost is recognised in employee benefits expense together with a corresponding increase in equity (other capital
reserves), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the
vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the SCI for a period represents the movement in
cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

In the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group, the share-based payment arrangements
described in note 11 have been classified as equity settled transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the
transaction with the employees for services it receives.


-----

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Right-of-use assets**

The Group leases various properties, equipment and cars. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods but may
have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms
and conditions.

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. This is the case if the contract
gives the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This right to control is
established if:

- The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset; and

- The Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

The identified asset should be physically distinct or be implicitly specified at the time the asset is made available. Even
if the asset is specified, the Group does not have the right to use the asset if the supplier has the substantive right to
substitute the asset throughout the period of use. If the contract is for use of a portion of an asset that is not physically
distinct it is not an identified asset unless it represents substantially all of the capacity of that asset.

Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available
for use by the Group.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability adjusted for
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received plus any initial direct
costs and an estimate of restoration costs.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and includes fixed payments,
variable lease payments linked to an index or rate and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is
reasonably certain to exercise. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change
in an index or rate or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination
option.

The lease payments are discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over
the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each
period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line
basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an
expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise
IT-equipment and small items of office furniture with a market value, when new, of less than £/€5,000.

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Intangible assets**

Separately acquired or internally generated intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any
recognised impairment loss.

An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project)
is recognised only if technical feasibility has been demonstrated such that the asset will be available for use or sale, that
there is an intention and ability to use or sell the asset (that it will generate future economic benefit) and that the
expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured. Where no internally generated intangible
asset can be recognised, development expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives on the following bases:

Software 3 to 5 years Straight line
Licences 1 to 15 years Straight line
Trademarks 15 years Straight line
Customer relationships 5 to 10 years Expected life of the underlying contract (collection profile)

Development costs are not amortised until the project they relate to is complete and goes live. Once the project is live
the costs are moved from development costs to the relevant category and amortised over the applicable useful economic
life.

Assets are reviewed for signs of impairment at least annually and more frequently if necessary. Impairments are
recognised where the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future economic benefit.

**2.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

**Significant accounting estimates and judgements**

The reported results of the Group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the
preparation of the Group’s financial statements. IFRS requires the Directors, in preparing the Group’s financial
statements, to select suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently, and make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable.

The judgements and estimates used in applying the Group’s accounting policies that are considered by the Directors to
be the most important to the portrayal of its financial position are detailed below. The use of estimates, assumptions or
models that differ from those adopted by the Group would affect its reported results.

**Portfolio investment valuation**

Portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value and are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.

The calculation of the EIR for each portfolio is based on the estimation of future cash flows, known as ERC’s. These
ERCs are based upon historical collections data from other portfolios with similar features such as type and quantum of
debt, or age. The calculation of the ERC for each portfolio investment is inherently judgemental as it involves the
estimation of future cash flows based upon collections data from the individual debt owed.

An uplift or reduction in expected future cash flows of 1% would increase or decrease the closing carrying value of
portfolio investments at 30 June 2020 by £16.5m (31 December 2019: £16.6m).

Actual cash flows are regularly compared to estimates to assess the accuracy of previous forecasts. Future collections
may differ from those estimated at this point in time and if they do differ, an adjustment is recorded to the carrying
value of the portfolio and is included as a net portfolio write up or write down within income.

The ERC of the portfolio investments has been assessed at the period-end on a regional basis. Management have
considered the observable information available in forming judgements for each region, noting that collections have
remained resilient during the first half of 2020, albeit reducing in the second quarter across the Group, largely due to
implemented management actions. Any regional underperformance is considered by management as a short-term
deferral rather than loss. Consequently, management have adjusted their expectations of the timing of future collections,
impacting the portfolio valuation in the short-term and resulting in the Group recognising a net portfolio write-down of
£2.7m during the six months to June 2020 (six months to June 2019: net portfolio write-up of £86.2m). Despite
management’s view that collections are resilient, there may be a further collections impact during the coming months
which causes ERC’s to be re-evaluated during the remainder of 2020.

The ongoing impact of COVID-19 continues to spread and may impact our ability to perform collection activities due
to disruptions to the court system or other key operational activities. Our assumptions regarding the duration and impact
of COVID-19 to future collections could change significantly as conditions evolve.


-----

**2.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**Goodwill**

The Group recognises goodwill on the acquisition of businesses. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired
business over the fair value of its net assets. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the
exercise of management judgement, particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted
prices, or assets such as acquired investment portfolios where valuations reflect estimates of future cash flows.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. ERCs form the principal cash flows along with 3PC revenue for the
CGUs. As at 30 June 2020 management has determined that the economic impact of COVID-19 could be an indicator
of impairment for goodwill and the Group have performed a goodwill impairment review, the result of which showed
no impairment to the carrying value of the Group’s goodwill.

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill
has been allocated. Calculation of the value in use requires an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from each
CGU after a suitable discount rate has been applied to calculate present value. This inherently involves a number of
judgements in that cash flow forecasts are prepared for periods that are beyond the normal requirement of management
reporting, and the appropriate discount rate relevant to the business is an estimate.

The Group’s significant estimate in the cash flow analysis underpinning the impairment review is the level of portfolio
acquisitions that can be achieved over the forecast period within each CGU, based on the future profitability and funding
profile of the Group.

See note 5 for further details.

**3.** **SEGMENTAL REPORTING**

**Segmentation**

IFRS 8 requires operating segment reporting to be based on information provided to the chief operating decision maker
which, in this case, is considered to be the Group Executive Committee. Information is presented to the Group Executive
Committee on the basis of the three main regions within which the Group operates – the UK, DACH and Nordic regions.
This is in line with the management of the Group. Holding company costs include amounts recognised in relation to
holding companies introduced to the Group on the acquisitions of the UK, DACH and Nordic regions.

The UK, DACH and Nordic operating segments derive revenues from the acquisition and collection of consumer debt
portfolios and receivables management.

All income is derived from external customers.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected
to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to three aggregated
CGUs on the basis that these represent the smallest groups of assets that individually generate cash inflows that are
largely independent of the cash in flows from other assets or groups of assets. The CGUs identified are the UK,
comprising of all subsidiary companies operated in the UK owned by Simon Bidco Limited, DACH, consisting of all
subsidiary companies operated in DACH owned by Lowell Holding GmbH and Nordics, consisting of all subsidiary
companies operated in the Nordic region owned by Lowell Nordics Oy.

Foreign currency denominated goodwill is retranslated from local currencies to the Group’s presentational currency at
each balance sheet date and gives rise to the currency translation effect shown above.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be
impaired.

The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The key
assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the level of portfolio acquisitions, discount rates,
growth rates and expected changes to collections and direct costs during the forecast period. The Group uses cash flow
expectations from the latest forecasts, prepared for the next four years and extrapolates these forecasts into perpetuity,
using growth rates of 1.5% to 2.0%.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGU’s are based
upon the subsidiary group’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and are as follows:

**31 December**

**30 June 2020** **2019**

**£000** **£000**

UK CGU .............................................................................................................................. 6.4% 6.8%
DACH CGU ......................................................................................................................... 4.8% 4.1%
Nordics CGU ........................................................................................................................ 6.7% 6.1%

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the latest forecasts as revised since the COVID-19 pandemic
reached the countries in which the CGUs operate. The forecasts assume growth rates in acquisitions which in turn drive
the forecast collections and cost figures.

**5.** **GOODWILL (CONTINUED)**

The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGU’s carrying value and concluded the
carrying value of the goodwill remains appropriate. Each sensitivity has been performed independently.

**UK CGU**

The CGU has a carrying value of £556m. Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cash flows of 60% would result
in an impairment at 30 June 2020. An increase in WACC of 4.9 percentage points to 11.3% would result in an
impairment at 30 June 2020.

**DACH CGU**

The CGU has a carrying value of £482m. Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cash flows of 50% would result
in an impairment at 30 June 2020. An increase in WACC of 2.4 percentage points to 7.2% would result in an impairment
at 30 June 2020.

**Nordics CGU**

The CGU has a carrying value of £189m. Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cash flows of 40% would result
in an impairment at 30 June 2020. An increase in WACC of 2.5 percentage points to 9.2% would result in an impairment
at 30 June 2020.

funding.

During April 2020, the Group drew down the €195.4m from the Revolving Credit Facility to utilise the €455m
commitment in full.

(31 December 2019: £5.6m).

**11.** **SHARE BASED PAYMENTS**

On 13 October 2015, the main shareholder of the Company – Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. entered into a share-based
payment arrangement with certain managers of the Group (the “Garfunkelux Group managers”).

Under this agreement, the Garfunkelux Group managers shall enter into a nominee agreement with Garfunkelux
Nominee S.à r.l. (“Nominee”), pursuant to which Nominee shall be the registered shareholder of the shareholder
instruments as nominee for the Garfunkelux Group managers and these managers should be the beneficial owners of
the shareholder instruments held by Nominee. The Garfunkelux Group managers subscribed for shares in Garfunkelux
Holdco 1 S.à r.l. at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.

The Garfunkelux Group managers further agreed, in the same agreement, to sell back to Garfunkelux Invest S.à r.l., the
main shareholder of Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., the shares owned in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. in the event they
cease to be an employee and/or a corporate officer of the Group. The selling price of the shares is determined on the
basis of a number of conditions including the service period and whether the Garfunkelux Group manager qualifies as
good leaver or bad leaver. The sale price of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. owned by the Garfunkelux
Group managers will be settled in cash.

In the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group, this arrangement has been classified as equity settled
transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with the Garfunkelux Group managers.
However since the amount paid by the Garfunkelux Group managers for the subscription of the shares in Garfunkelux
Holdco 1 S.à r.l. are at fair value, the awards have no material fair value at grant date and therefore there is no expense
recognised in the SCI for the year or previous year.

**12.** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**Fair value measurements recognised in the Statement of Financial Position**

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at
fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities;

- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
and

- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or
liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

**Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost**

For the Group, the fair value of the acquired portfolios is determined using a discounted cash flow model with
unobservable inputs and are classified as level 3 measurements. The unobservable inputs in determining the fair value
are the discount rate and service cost percentage which differ for portfolios that are not deemed as “paying” at the point
of acquisition and those that are deemed as “paying”. A “paying” portfolio is determined at the point of acquisition
based on the proportion of accounts within that portfolio that are set up on a payment plan. The discount rates have been
determined from market information and benchmarking. The service cost percentage is the percentage used to discount
the gross cash flows to net and is based on historical information on costs to collect.

The Senior and the Senior Secured Notes are publicly traded instruments whose value can be obtained from public
sources; as a result these are classified as level 1. The remaining financial assets and liabilities carried are assumed to
have a fair value equal to their carrying value.

The fair value of non-financial instruments have been considered and it was determined that the fair value is materially
equal to their carrying value therefore no additional disclosure has been made.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GARFUNKELUX HOLDCO 2 S.A.**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

To the Shareholder of
Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A.
488, route de Longwy
L-1940 Luxembourg
Luxembourg

**REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE**

**Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (the
“Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019, the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a
summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2019 and of its consolidated financial performance and its
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July
2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the “Commission
de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs are
further described in the « Responsibilities of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated
financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA
Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those
ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.

**Other matter - The impact of uncertainties due to Britain exiting the European Union on our audit.**

Uncertainties related to the effects of Brexit are relevant to understanding our audit of the consolidated financial
statements. All audits assess and challenge the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Directors, such
as recoverability of intangible assets, goodwill, receivables and deferred taxes and related disclosures and the
appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. All of these
depend on assessments of the future economic environment and the Group’s future prospects and performance.

Brexit is one of the most significant economic events for the UK, and at the date of this report its effects are
subject to unprecedented levels of uncertainty of outcomes, with the full range of possible effects unknown. We
applied a standardised firm-wide approach in response to that uncertainty when assessing the Group’s future
prospects and performance. However, no audit should be expected to predict the unknowable factors or all possible
future implications for a company and this is particularly the case in relation to Brexit.

**Other information**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
stated in the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our
report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.


-----

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GARFUNKELUX HOLDCO 2 S.A.**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board
of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Responsibilities of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements**

The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of “Réviseur
d’Entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the
CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Group’s internal control.

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

  - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the
“Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé”. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

  - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

  - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Corporate information**

The consolidated financial statements of Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (together “The Group”)
for the year ended 31 December 2019 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of Directors on
13 March 2020. Under Luxembourg Law, the consolidated financial statements are approved by the shareholder
at the Annual General Meeting. Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. (the Company or the parent) is incorporated as an
S.A. (Société Anonyme) and domiciled in Luxembourg. The registered office is located at 488 route de Longwy,
in Luxembourg Ville.

The Group is principally engaged in the provision of credit management services. Information regarding the Group
structure is presented in note 15. Information on other related party transactions is presented in note 32.

**General information and basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair
value. Those standards have been applied consistently to the historical periods. The financial year is the calendar
year.

**Adoption of new and revised standards**

The Group initially applied IFRS 16 “Leases” from 1 January 2019. Other standards effective from 1 January
2019 do not have a material impact on the financial statements.

IFRS 16 introduces a single, on balance sheet accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use
asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease
payments. The only exemptions to this are short-term leases and leases of low value items.

The Group has applied the modified retrospective approach with no restatement of comparative information
required.

At 1 January 2019, the Group recognised a right-of-use asset of £49.3m (disclosed as part of property, plant and
equipment in the balance sheet), lease liabilities of £53.7m (included within other financial liabilities) and release
of lease accruals of £4.4m.

On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which were previously
classified as ‘operating leases’ in accordance with IAS 17. The liabilities recognised were measured at the present
value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate of 4.3%.

The €455m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) is the Group’s primary working capital facility which is used to
service the leases and is secured on the assets of the Group. Therefore, the RCF’s interest rate is used as the base
for calculating the effective incremental borrowing rate.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Adoption of new and revised standards (continued)**

The table below shows the impact of incremental weighted average rate applied to lease liabilities recognised at
the date of initial application and difference between:

a) the operating lease commitments disclosed applying IAS 17 as at 31 December 2018, (discounted using the

Group’s at the date of initial application); and

b) the lease liabilities recognised at the date of initial application under IFRS 16.

**£000**

**Operating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018 ................................** **61,614**
Discounted using the Groups incremental borrowing rate of 4.3% .................................... 55,064
Add: Recognition of rent to expiry date of leases .............................................................. 10,468
Add: Additional lease liabilities ......................................................................................... 1,142
Less: Low-value leases recognised on a straight-line basis as expense .............................. (134)
Less: Short term leases ....................................................................................................... (457)
Less: Non IFRS 16 operating lease commitments .............................................................. (12,367)
**Lease liability recognised as at 1 January 2019 .............................................................** **53,716**

In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the
standard:

  - the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;

  - the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January
2019 as short-term leases;

  - the exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial
application; and

  - the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or
terminate the lease.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A.
(“the Company”) and all its subsidiary undertakings (together “the Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2019.

The Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:

  - Power over the investee (i.e. existing voting rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee);

  - Exposure, or rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and

  - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its return.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support its presumption
and when the Group has less than a majority of voting rights or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers
all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee including:

  - The contractual arrangements with the other investee;

  - Rights arising from the contractual arrangements; and

  - The Group voting rights and potential voting rights.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Functional and presentation currency**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are prepared in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its “Functional Currency”). For the purposes of these consolidated financial
statements, the results are prepared in Sterling, (the Group’s “Presentational Currency”). All amounts have been
rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.

**Going concern**

The Group’s business activities are set out in the strategic report and the Group’s performance is set out in the
SCI and the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (“SFP”) on pages F-34 and F-35 respectively. In
addition, note 28 to these consolidated financial statements includes the Group’s financial risk management
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity
risk.

The Cash EBITDA of the Group is an industry accepted measure of a business’s cash flow generation. The Group
has demonstrated strong performance during the year ended 31 December 2019 with Cash EBITDA of £496.0m,
an increase of £82.5m on the year ended 31 December 2018. The Group is in a net asset position of £159.6m at
31 December 2019.

The business as a whole is cash generative before portfolio acquisitions, generating cash of £452.5m in the year
ended 31 December 2019, with operating cash flow after portfolio acquisitions being £37.4m. The Group
continually monitors its cash flow requirements to ensure that enough cash is available to meet its commitments.

The Group has four main sources of funding at 31 December 2019, €365m, £565m, €415m, €530m and
SEK1,280m of listed Senior Secured loan notes (“notes”), £196.5m of listed Senior loan notes, a €455m RCF and
a securitisation facility with an option to reset of £255m. There are covenants on the funding which are detailed
in note 20. No maintenance covenants have been breached in 2019. The earliest debt maturity horizon is 31
December 2021 and the latest is 10 April 2024, being the RCF and the Securitisation Loan respectively. The
Group continues to monitor its funding requirements and will take action to extend or re-negotiate existing
facilities, or explore new funding arrangements as appropriate.

Management assessed that the combined operating cash flows of the Group, together with the cash resources and
future borrowings under the RCF, will be sufficient to fund the Group’s debt and tax servicing requirements as
they become due, working capital requirements and anticipated debt purchases. However, the Group’s ability to
obtain funding in the future from these sources will depend on its performance and prospects, as well as other
factors beyond its control, such factors may include weak economic and capital market conditions. An inability
to procure sufficient funding at favourable terms to purchase portfolios as they become available could have an
adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

As one of a number of mitigating measures, the Group is focussed on reducing leverage in line with its guidance
of 4.0-3.5x by 2021/2022. Portfolio acquisitions are largely discretionary and provide the Group with significant
control of its cash flow.

The Group has also completed a comprehensive review of the potential impact of Brexit, including assessing the
potential impact on customers, colleagues, clients and funding. This review did not identify any material issues
which would affect the going concern of either the UK business or the Group.

Overall, there are long term business plans and short term forecasts in place which are reviewed and updated on
a regular basis by management. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for at least 18 months from the signing date. They consequently adopt the
going concern basis of accounting in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Foreign currency**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective Functional Currencies of Group entities at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the Functional Currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling
at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the SCI. Non-monetary assets
and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange
rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are
stated at fair value are retranslated to the Functional Currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair
value was determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
consolidation, are translated to the Group’s Presentational Currency (Sterling) at foreign exchange rates ruling at
the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the
period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange
differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control,
joint control or significant influence (as the case may be) is lost, the entire accumulated amount in the Foreign
Currency Translation Reserve, net of amounts previously attributed to non-controlling interests, is reclassified to
profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while still retaining control, the relevant proportion of the accumulated
amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an
associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while still retaining significant influence or joint
control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.

**Business combinations**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for
each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of completion) of assets given, liabilities
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. At
acquisition, non-controlling interest (“NCI”) is measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in
profit or loss as incurred.

Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are
adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below).

All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are
accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRS standards. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration
classified as equity are not recognised.

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition
under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of
deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are
recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits)
respectively.

On a business combination the portfolio investments are recalculated to fair value using an appropriate discount
rate at the date of acquisition, calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date.

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete
information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of
one year from the date of acquisition.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the
acquisition date). Goodwill is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to
benefit from that business combination. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Total goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. If there is evidence of impairment in any CGU, goodwill
allocated to that CGU is also tested for impairment.

The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs
to sell, and value in use. Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast
cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate discount rate.

If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on
a pro-rated basis in relation to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a subsidiary, the goodwill attributable to that
subsidiary is included when calculating the profit or loss on disposal.

**Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method**

_Finance revenue on acquired portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments represents the yield from acquired portfolio investments, net of VAT where
applicable. Acquired portfolio investments are held to collect contractual cash flows of payments of solely
principal and interest, recognising them at amortised cost and in line with IFRS 9.

The effective interest rate (“EIR”) is the rate that exactly discounts the day one estimated future cash receipts of
the acquired portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition, (i.e. the price paid to acquire the
asset). These estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the estimated remaining life of the portfolios and
range from 84 months to 120 months.

Acquired portfolio investments are acquired at a deep discount and classified as purchased or originated credit
impaired (“POCI”) in line with IFRS 9. As a result, the estimated future cash flows and hence EIR, reflect the
expected life time credit losses within each portfolio.

Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cash flows be deemed greater than
previous estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period to derive future cash receipts. The difference in
carrying value following an enhanced collection forecast is recognised in the net portfolio write up line item within
income, with subsequent reversals also recorded in this line. This line represents the net impairment gains on
portfolio investments.

As part of the acquisition accounting around the purchase of Metis Bidco Limited by Simon Bidco Limited on 13
October 2015 the portfolio investments were uplifted to their fair value at the date of acquisition. The portfolio
fair value release represents the unwinding of this fair value uplift (see note 16). This uplift is being unwound in
line with the standard profile of a gross ERC curve of these portfolios.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method (continued)**

_Service revenue_

Service revenue represents amounts receivable for tracing and debt collecting services (commissions and fees)
provided to third party clients including collection lawyers, net of VAT where applicable. Performance obligations
within service contracts are the collection of cash and hence these are satisfied when the Group collects on debt.
Payment is due from clients shortly after cash is collected on their behalf. Revenue is recognised when
performance obligations are satisfied.

**Impairment of acquired portfolio investments**

Acquired portfolio investments are reviewed for indications of impairment in accordance with the IFRS 9 forward
looking expected credit loss (“ECL”) model. As the Group’s portfolio investments are classified as POCI assets,
lifetime ECL is included in the calculation of EIR. The estimation of expected credit losses includes an assessment
of forward-looking economic assumptions. Impairment represents changes to carrying values, discounted at the
EIR, of the portfolio investments as a result of reassessments of the estimated future cash flows. These are
recognised in net portfolio write up in the SCI.

The impairment adjustment is calculated by discounting regularly revised cash flow forecasts developed for each
individual portfolio investment, at the initially set EIR. The cash flow forecasts, which represent the undiscounted
value of the ERC of our portfolio investments at a given point in time, are calculated over the portfolio expected
useful life, based on previous month’s collections and portfolio performance information collated within our
proprietary valuation model.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Consolidated SFP when the Group becomes
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

_Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss_

This category relates to financial assets and liabilities that must be recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
Such assets or liabilities are initially recognised at cost, which at this point equates to fair value. They must be
measured subsequently at fair value.

The main assets and liabilities in the Group falling into this category are derivative financial instruments that do
not fall under the scope of hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9.

_Loans and receivables_

Acquired portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value. The
portfolios are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the EIR method.

The portfolio investment is analysed between current and non-current in the SFP. The current asset is determined
using the expected cash flows arising in the next twelve months after the SFP date. The residual amount is
classified as non-current.

Portfolio investments include litigation costs which represent upfront fees paid during the litigation process,
expected to be recoverable from the customer and added to the customer account balance to be recovered at a later
date.

Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market are classified as ‘Trade and other receivables’. Trade and other receivables are measured at
amortised cost using the EIR method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective
interest rate, except for short-term receivables (including Trade receivables) when the recognition of interest
would be immaterial.

**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Financial instruments (continued)**

The Group has forward flow agreements in place in relation to the future acquisition of portfolio investments. The
fair value and subsequent amortised cost of portfolios acquired under these agreements are determined on the
same basis as the Group’s other acquired portfolio investments.

_Impairment of financial assets_

Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit or loss are assessed for indicators of impairment
at least at the end of each period end. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future
cash flows of the investment have been affected.

_Derecognition of financial assets_

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another
entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues
to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability
for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a
transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises collateralised
borrowings for the proceeds received.

_Financial liabilities and equity_

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the
substance of the contractual arrangement.

_Financial liabilities_

All financial liabilities held by the Group are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, except for those
measured at fair value through the SCI, e.g. derivative liabilities. The Group derecognises financial liabilities
when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Group does not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Derivative financial instruments have been used for hedging. As of the balance sheet date, they relate to hedges
taken out to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into, and
subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the
SCI immediately. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value
is negative.

**Fair value measurements**

The fair value of financial instruments is determined in accordance with IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement), as
described in note 28.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event, if it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and if a reliable estimate of the
amount of the obligation can be made.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the SFP date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a
provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the
discounted present value of those cash flows.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third
party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the
amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

**Pensions**

**Defined benefit pensions**

The Group provides defined benefit pension plans through some of its German and Nordic subsidiaries. Provisions
for pensions are calculated pursuant to IAS 19. Actuarial models are used to calculate the provisions for pensions
and the related pension expenses. These calculations use various assumptions such as current actuarial
probabilities (discount factors, increase in cost of living etc.), assumptions regarding turnover based on age and
years of service as well as experience-based assumptions concerning the probability of occurrence of pension
payments, annuity payments or endowment payments. The probabilities used in the inputs may deviate from actual
developments due to changes in market and economic conditions. Sensitivity analysis is used to determine the
financial effects of the deviations in the significant inputs.

**Defined contribution pensions**

The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for the benefit of its employees. Contributions payable are
charged to the SCI in the period they are payable.

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

_Current tax_

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported
in the SCI because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Taxation (continued)**

_Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable
profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each SFP date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or
the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the SFP date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the SCI, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

_VAT_

Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of VAT, except:

  - Where the VAT incurred on purchased goods and services cannot be reclaimed from the tax authorities,
in which case the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of the asset or as an expense.

  - Receivables and liabilities are stated with the amount of VAT included.

The VAT amount reclaimable from, or payable to, the tax authorities is reported under receivables or liabilities in
the balance sheet.

**Collection activity costs**

Collection activity costs represent direct staff costs and the direct third party costs in providing services as a debt
collection agency or collecting debts on acquired portfolio investments; examples include printing and postage,
third party commissions, search and trace costs, litigation, telephone and SMS costs. Costs are recognised as
incurred.

**Current versus non-current classification**

The Group presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position based on current/noncurrent classification.

An asset is current when it is:

  - Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;

  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;

  - Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or

  - Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least
twelve months after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

  - It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;

  - It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;

  - It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or

  - There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the
reporting period.

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities respectively.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits with a term from inception of three months
or less, less bank overdrafts where there is a right to offset. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to
the extent that there is no right to offset with cash balances in the same currency.

The Group holds cash on behalf of third parties as part of its collection activities and its securitisation facilities.
This restricted cash is shown within cash with a corresponding liability recognised in other payables.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Share-based Payments**

Some employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based
payments settled by the main shareholder of the Group as described in note 27.

IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires an entity to account for a transaction in which it either:

  - Receives goods or services when another entity in the same group (or a shareholder of any group entity)
has the obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction; or

  - Has an obligation to settle a share-based payment transaction when another entity in the same group
receives the goods or services;

unless the transaction is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the entity
receiving them.

_Equity-settled transactions_

To the extent a cost is recognised, the cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date
when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model.

The cost is recognised in employee benefits expense together with a corresponding increase in equity (other capital
reserves), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the
vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the SCI for a period represents the
movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

In the consolidated financial statements of the Group, the share-based payment arrangements described in note 27
have been classified as equity settled transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with
the employees for services it receives.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Hardware 3 to 5 years
Office equipment 3 to 15 years
Leasehold improvements Life of lease (1 to 15 years)

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the SCI.

Borrowing costs are added to the costs of an asset provided it is a qualifying asset pursuant to IAS 23.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Intangible assets**

Separately acquired or internally generated intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and
any recognised impairment loss.

An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal
project) is recognised only if technical feasibility has been demonstrated such that the asset will be available for
use or sale, that there is an intention and ability to use or sell the asset, that it will generate future economic benefit,
and that the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured. Where no internally
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

Software 3 to 5 years Straight line
Licences 1 to 5 years Straight line
Trademarks 15 years Straight line
Customer relationships 5 to 10 years Expected life of the underlying
contract (collection profile)

Development costs are not amortised until the project they relate to is complete and goes live. Once the project is
live the costs are moved from development costs to the relevant category and amortised over the applicable useful
economic life.

Assets are reviewed for signs of impairment at least annually and more frequently if necessary. Impairments are
recognised where the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future economic benefit.

**Leases**

**Leases prior to 1 January 2019**

Rentals payable under operating leases were charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on
a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis was more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset were consumed. Contingent
rentals arising under operating leases were recognised as an expense in the period in which they were incurred.

In the event that lease incentives were received to enter into operating leases, the aggregate benefit of incentives
was recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis
was more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset were consumed.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Leases and Right-of-use assets from 1 January 2019**

The Group leases various properties, equipment and cars. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods
but may have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of
different terms and conditions.

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. This is the case if the
contract gives the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This right
to control is established if:

  - The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset; and

  - The Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

The identified asset should be physically distinct or be implicitly specified at the time the asset is made available.
Even if the asset is specified, the Group does not have the right to use the asset if the supplier has the substantive
right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use. If the contract is for use of a portion of an asset that is
not physically distinct, it is not an identified asset unless it represents substantially all of the capacity of that asset.

Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is
available for use by the Group.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received plus
any initial direct costs and an estimate of restoration costs.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and includes fixed
payments, variable lease payments linked to an index or rate and the exercise price under a purchase option that
the Group is reasonably certain to exercise. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments
arising from a change in an index or rate or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a
purchase, extension or termination option.

The lease payments are discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The weighted average
incremental borrowing rate at initial application of IFRS 16 was 4.3%.

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss
over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability
for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term
on a straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis
as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value
assets comprise IT-equipment and small items of office furniture with a market value, when new, of less than
£/€5,000.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**2.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The reported results of the Group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie
the preparation of the Group’s financial statements. IFRS requires the Directors, in preparing the Group’s financial
statements, to select suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently, and make judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent.

The judgements and associated estimates used in applying the Group’s accounting policies that are considered by
the Directors to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial position are detailed below. The use of
estimates, assumptions or models that differ from those adopted by the Group would affect its reported results.

**Portfolio investment valuation**

Portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value and are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.

The calculation of the EIR for each portfolio is based on the estimation of future cash flows. These cash flows are
estimates and are therefore inherently judgemental. These Estimated Remaining Collections (“ERCs”) are based
upon historical collections data from other portfolios with similar features such as type and quantum of debt, or
age. The calculation of the ERC for each portfolio investment is inherently judgemental as it involves the
estimation of future cash flows based upon collections data from the individual debt owed.

Actual cash flows are regularly compared to estimates to assess the accuracy of previous forecasts. Over the course
of the past 3 years, the Groups forecasting accuracy (measured as actual cash collections as a percent of estimated
collections) has been between 103% and 107%.

An uplift or reduction in expected future cash flows of 1% would increase or decrease the closing carrying value
of portfolio investments at 31 December 2019 by £16.6m (31 December 2018: £15.4m).

If the forecast portfolio collections exceed initial estimates, an adjustment is recorded as an increase to the carrying
value of the portfolio and is included in income as a portfolio write up.

**Goodwill and valuation of intangible assets**

The Group recognises goodwill on the acquisition of businesses as discussed in the significant accounting policies.
Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of its net assets. The determination
of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those
financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired investment portfolios
where valuations reflect estimates of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the
goodwill arising and to the post acquisition performance of the acquisition.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an
estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of the value in use
requires an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU after a suitable discount rate has been
applied to calculate present value. This inherently involves a number of judgements in that cash flow forecasts
are prepared for periods that are beyond the normal requirement of management reporting, and the appropriate
discount rate relevant to the business is an estimate.

See note 11 for further details.

**2.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**Leases**

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group.
These terms are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension
and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive
to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after
termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not
terminated). The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs
which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.

**3.** **SEGMENTAL REPORTING**

**Segmentation**

IFRS 8 requires operating segment reporting to be based on information provided to the chief operating decision
maker which, in this case, is considered to be the Group Executive Committee. Information is presented to the
Group Executive Committee on the basis of the three main regions within which the Group operates – the UK,
DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Croatia) and Nordic (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland)
regions. This is in line with the management of the Group. Holding company costs include amounts recognised
in relation to holding companies introduced to the Group on the acquisitions of the UK, DACH and Nordic
regions.

The UK, DACH and Nordic operating segments derive revenues from the acquisition and collection of consumer
debt portfolios and receivables management.

All revenues are derived from external customers.

**10.** **ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES**

**Acqusition of Lucas Credit Services**

On 13 July 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Lucas Credit Services, a UK FCA
authorised 3PC and Litigation business. The Group paid cash consideration of £4.4m with preliminary goodwill
of £2.9m recognised. The figures are after fair value adjustments of £0.7m.

**Acquisition of Carve-out Business from Intrum**

On 20 March 2018, the Group acquired 100% share in Fair Pay Please AS and Lindorff Sverige AB, which
represent the Carve-out Business from Intrum for €741 million (£647 million). The acquisition was made through
Lowell Nordics Oy (formerly Hansa Bidco Oy, formerly Pofidax Oy), an indirect subsidiary of the Company.

The carve-out comprised Lindorff’s entire business in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden as well as Intrum
Justitia’s entire business in Norway and was specified by the European Commission as a condition of the
combination of the two companies in 2017.

The business in Estonia, Lowell Eesti AS, had been a small part of Lowell Nordics’ and was subsequently disposed
of in July 2019 to allow Lowell to focus on its core market.

The combined business added a greater scale and diversification in terms of a broader geographic reach, a more
balanced revenue mix together with a complementary and client-focused product offering.

In the nine months to 31 December 2018 the Carve-out Business contributed £9.7m profit to the consolidated net
loss for the period and £142.9m to consolidated income. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018,
management estimates that Group income would have been £42.2m higher and Group net loss would have been
£3.2m lower. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose
on the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018.

**Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed**

The following table summarises the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of
acquisition.

**Measurement of fair value**

The valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of material assets acquired were as follows:

**Assets acquired Valuation technique**

Customer relationships Income approach
Non-performing loans Income approach
Software Market comparison and cost technique

No contingent consideration or contingent liabilities remain in respect of the acquisition as at 31 December 2018
or 31 December 2019.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognised as follows:

**£000**

Consideration transferred .......................................................................................................................... 646,818
Fair value of identifiable net assets ........................................................................................................... (464,536)

**Goodwill (note 11) ...................................................................................................................................** **182,282**

The goodwill value comprised the skills and technical talent of the Carve-out Business’s workforce and the expected synergies
arising from the acquisition which was not separately recognised.

The Group incurred acquisition related costs of £12.5m on legal fees and due diligence costs. These costs have been included
in other operating expenses in FY18 and FY17.

For accounting purposes, the effective date of the acquisition was 31 March 2018 as there was an immaterial difference
between the acquisition date and the month end date.

None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are
expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to three
aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes. The CGUs identified are the UK, comprising of all subsidiary companies operated in the
UK owned by Simon Bidco Limited, DACH, consisting of all subsidiary companies operated in DACH owned
by Lowell Holding GmbH and Nordics, consisting of all subsidiary companies operated in the Nordic region
owned by Lowell Nordics Oy.

Foreign currency denominated goodwill is retranslated at each balance sheet date and gives rise to the currency
translation effect shown above.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might
be impaired.

The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and
expected changes to collections and direct costs during the forecast period. The Group uses cash flow forecasts
from the latest budgets, prepared for the next four years and extrapolates these forecasts into perpetuity, using
growth rates of 1.5% to 2.0%.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGU’s are
based upon the subsidiary group’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and are as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2019** **2018**
**£000** **£000**

UK CGU ....................................................................................................... 6.8% 7.8%
DACH CGU ................................................................................................. 4.1% 5.5%
Nordics CGU ................................................................................................ 6.1%  

-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**11.** **GOODWILL (CONTINUED)**

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent detailed financial budgets approved by
management for the next four years. The forecasts assume growth rates in acquisitions which in turn drive the
forecast collections and cost figures.

The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGU’s carrying value. Each
sensitivity has been performed independently.

**UK CGU**

The CGU has a carrying value of £556m. Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cash flows of 47% would
result in an impairment at 31 December 2019. An increase in WACC of 3.5 percentage points to 10.3% would
result in an impairment at 31 December 2019.

**DACH CGU**

The CGU has a carrying value of £449m. Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cash flows of 65% would
result in an impairment at 31 December 2019. An increase in WACC of 3.3 percentage points to 7.4% would
result in an impairment at 31 December 2019.

**NORDICS CGU**

The CGU has a carrying value of £180m. Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cash flows of 49% would
result in an impairment at 31 December 2019. An increase in WACC of 2.2 percentage points to 8.3% would
result in an impairment at 31 December 2019.

On 20 September 2017 the Group issued €415m 3.5% plus EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) Senior Secured
Notes due 2023 through its subsidiary Garfunkelux Holdco 3 S.A. The interest on the loan notes is payable
quarterly on 1 December, 1 March, 1 June and 1 September, commencing on 1 December 2017. The notes will
mature on 1 September 2023, though the Group may redeem some or all of the notes at an earlier date as per the
details set out in the Offering Memorandum issued on 6 September 2017.

On 2 February 2018, the Group issued €530m floating rate senior secured notes at a rate of 4.5% + EURIBOR
(subject to a 0% floor) and SEK 1,280m floating rate senior secured notes at a rate of 4.75% + STIBOR (subject

Notes will mature on 1 September 2023, though the Group may redeem some or all of the Notes at an earlier date
as per the details set out in the Offering Memorandum issued on 19 January 2018.

There are two covenant measures under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes; Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
which must be at least 2:1 and Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, which cannot exceed 4.5:1. These
are incurrence covenants only, which would only need to be satisfied should the Group intend to raise additional
senior secured financing.

The Senior Secured Notes are secured on the assets, share pledges and intra-group receivables of the Group and
are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (EUROMTF).

**Senior Unsecured Notes (“Notes”)**

On 19 October 2015 the Company issued £230m 11.0% Senior Notes due 2023. The interest on the Notes is

Memorandum issued on 14 October 2015. The Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange.

On 29 August 2019 the Group repurchased £33.5m of the 11% Senior Unsecured Notes through its subsidiary
company Simon Bidco Limited recognising a gain of £3.9m. Following the 11% Senior Unsecured Notes
purchase, £196.5 million in aggregate principal remains outstanding in the open market. The 11% Unsecured
Senior Notes repurchased by the Group remain held by the Group and were not immediately cancelled in the
financial year.

There is one covenant measure under the terms of the Notes, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, which must be at
least 2:1. These are incurrence covenants only, which would only need to be satisfied should the Group intend to
raise additional senior secured financing.

**Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”)**

The Group has an RCF commitment of €455m. The RCF has a variable interest rate linked to LIBOR/EURIBOR
(subject to a 0% floor) and a quarterly commitment fee calculated on the undrawn facility.

Any material company or other member of the Group, which becomes a guarantor of the RCF is required (subject
to agreed security principles) to grant security over certain of its material assets and (if wholly owned by another
member or members of the Group) to have its shares (or equivalent ownership interests) secured in favour of the
Security Agent.

There is one covenant measure under the terms of the RCF additional to the covenant measures under the Senior
Secured Notes as follows: if the aggregate amount of all loan utilisations exceed an amount equal to 30% of the
total commitments, the Group is required to confirm whether or not the Leverage Ratio exceeds 7:1. This is a
maintenance covenant and if breached prevents further drawdown on the facility.

On 13 October 2015, the main shareholder of the Company – Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. entered into a sharebased payment arrangement with certain managers of the Group (the “Garfunkelux Group managers”).

Under this agreement, the Garfunkelux Group managers entered into a nominee agreement with Garfunkelux
Nominee S.à r.l. (“Nominee”), pursuant to which the Nominee is the registered shareholder of the shareholder
instruments as nominee for the Garfunkelux Group managers and these managers are the beneficial owners of the
shareholder instruments held by Nominee. The Garfunkelux Group managers subscribed for shares in
Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of
grant.

The Garfunkelux Group managers further agreed, in the same agreement, to sell back to Garfunkelux Invest
S.à r.l., the main shareholder of Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., the shares owned in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l.
in the event they cease to be an employee and/or a corporate officer of the Group. The selling price of the shares
is determined on the basis of a number of conditions including the service period and whether the Garfunkelux
Group manager qualifies as a good leaver or a bad leaver. The sale price of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1
S.à r.l. owned by the Garfunkelux Group managers will be settled in cash.

In the consolidated financial statements of the Group, this arrangement has been classified as equity settled
transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with the Garfunkelux Group managers.
However, since amounts paid by the Garfunkelux Group managers for the subscription of the shares in
Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. are at fair value, the awards have no material fair value at grant date and therefore
there is no expense recognised in the SCI for the year or previous year.

**Strategic risk management**

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings resulting from poor or lack of clear strategy and execution, adverse business
decisions, and inadequate anticipation of emerging changes in the broader business, economic and political
environment, including changing competitive threats and disruptive innovations, internal or external. This
includes the risk of changes caused by market variables such as prices, type and timing of debt coming to the
market, i.e. the cost of consumer debt portfolios.

In bidding for consumer debt portfolios, the Group seeks to achieve a sufficient yield to cover both the cost of
collection and overhead costs, thereby minimising the risk of not recovering the cost of these portfolios. The
Group uses sophisticated pricing models along with extensive customer and market data to establish the
profitability of portfolios coming to market. The Group monitors its pricing assumptions through Investment
Committees (subsets of the Executive Committee).

The Group manages the unpredictability of the market through a number of financing structures. The Group has
in place €365m, £565m, €415m, €530m and SEK 1,280m of Senior Secured loan Notes, £196.5m of Senior loan
Notes, €455m RCF facility and securitisation facility with an option to reset of £255.0m. At 31 December 2019
the securitisation and RCF facilities were £459.9m drawn down (31 December 2018: £276.0m). These facilities
allow the Group the flexibility to bid on portfolios as and when they come to market and are not restricted by cash
flow constraints.

**Financial risk management**

**Credit and Counterparty risk management**

Credit and counterparty risk is the risk to earnings, financial loss arising from a counterparty default on contractual
obligations or risk to earnings, financial loss or capital impact from a customer failure to meet a contractual
repayment schedule.

The risk from the concentration of debtor credit risk is limited due to the high number of individual customer
balances and the relatively low value of each of the individual’s debts.

The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios.
All portfolios by their nature are impaired on acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections.
Carrying values are impaired when and if the underlying performance does not meet initial expectations. The ongoing risk is managed through utilising a comprehensive portfolio valuation model and building current
expectations of recoverability from information on debt types and customers into pricing assumptions and models.
An Investment Committee is in place which is attended by members of the Executive Committee as well as other
key indivduals from across the business.

This committee is in place to scrutinise all aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational and compliance risk
through to the financial assumptions and maximum bid price.

The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements, which are net of
impairment losses, represents the Groups exposure to credit risk.

The Group’s most significant exposure to credit risk is to portfolio investments.

**Liquidity and Capital risk management**

Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability (or at excessive funding costs) to meet contractual or contingent
financial obligations as they arise, and could potentially impact the Group’s condition or overall safety and
soundness. Capital risk relates to the risk of holding insufficient capital to absorb unexpected loss. The approach
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its
liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by continuously
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. At 31 December 2019, the Group had available undrawn committed
borrowing facilities of £198.4m (31 December 2018: £377.7m). See note 20 for further details on banking
facilities.

The following tables show the Group’s gross undiscounted contractual cash flows of financial liabilities including

**Liquidity and Capital risk management (continued)**

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Group Executive Committee, which has
established an appropriate liquidity risk management approach for the management of the Group’s short, medium
and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining
adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and
actual cash flows, and by monitoring the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Details of additional
undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are set out below.

**Group financing facilities**

**31 December** **31 December**

**2019** **2018**
**£000** **£000**

**Securitisation and RCF**
Amount used .................................................................................................. 459,901 276,049
Amount unused .............................................................................................. 198,385 377,664

**Total ..............................................................................................................** **658,286** **653,713**


**Capital risk management**

The Group’s objective in managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base to support current operations and
planned growth and so to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20 after
deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity (“SoCE”).

**Interest rate risk management**

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings, income, valuation arising from changes in interest rates. The Group has
minimised its risk against changes in interest rates by following a balanced approach to funding by using fixed
rate Notes, floating rate Notes and share capital.

The Group’s RCF has a variable interest rate and at 31 December 2019 this was £265.7m drawn down (31
December 2018: £14.0m). Interest is payable on the RCF at a maximum of 3.5% + LIBOR/EURIBOR. The Group
also had three floating rate note issuances in place at 31 December 2019 with principals of €415m, €530m and
SEK 1,280m and interest rates of 3.5% + EURIBOR, 4.5% + EURIBOR and 4.75% + STIBOR respectively, all
with floors of 0%.

**Interest rate sensitivity analysis**

The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments
at the SFP date. A 2.5 percentage point increase or decrease represents management’s assessment of the
reasonably possible change in interest rates. If interest rates had been 2.5 percentage points higher for the full year
and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s losses would increase for the year ended 31 December
2019 by c£34.8m (2018: c£29.5m). This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable
rate borrowings.

**Foreign exchange swap contracts**

The derivatives recognised at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018 relate to OTC (“Over the Counter”)
foreign exchange derivatives that the Group transacts with its banking partners. In order to recognise the fair value
of these derivatives, the fair value calculation performed by the Group as of the balance sheet date is used, which
is based on the customary market method and is regularly compared with fair value calculations provided by the
counter parties. The fair value of foreign exchange swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows
over the residual term of the contract based on current market rates and the term structure of interest rates.

**Foreign exchange risk management**

The Group has exposure to foreign exchange risk through its investments in overseas operations which have
functional currencies other than Sterling and foreign currency denominated assets/liabilities and transactions. The
Group is principally exposed to Euro (EUR), Swedish krona (SEK), Norwegian krone (NOK) and Danish krone
(DKK) and minimises its foreign currency risk by having both assets and liabilities in functional currencies other
than Sterling. As the assets and liabilities are matched where practical, the Group monitors and manages its
exposure. The carrying values of the Groups principle foreign currency denominated net assets are as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2019** **2018**

**£000** **£000**
**Net assets**

**Total ..............................................................................................................** **(247,968)** **(225,761)**


**Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis**

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase against Sterling exchange rates. This
represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity
analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated financial instruments and adjusts their
translation at the year end only for a change in foreign currency rates, holding all other variables constant.

**Insurance risk management**

The Group has a full program of insurance coverage in place, this includes polices for Directors and Officers,
Professional Indemnity and Cyber. Coverage is assessed and updated as required on an annual basis.

**Compliance risk**

Compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss or reputation damages
resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, ethical standards, prescribed practices, internal policies
and procedures and from fraud, corruption or bribery. The Group faces a number of regulations which are subject
to ongoing change. The Group has an active compliance programme in place with dedicated compliance teams in
each region. Compliance risk is overseen by the Executive Committee, regional and Group Risk Committees and
the Investor Board.

In the UK, a number of entities are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). If the FCA deems the
Group’s conduct and customer interaction to be poor or non-compliant it can impose a financial penalty and/or
financial redress for customers. The ultimate penalty would be the withdrawal of that company’s authorisation to
provide financial services. The Directors are not aware of any indication that this is a possibility and seek to
minimise the risk through initiatives such as the Lowell FAIR programme which enshrines the FCA’s six Treating
Customers Fairly principles around fair customer treatment in the Group’s day-to-day activity. Specifically, the
FAIR programme helps shape processes to achieve fair outcomes for customers, assessment of affordability and
monitoring and oversight to minimise conduct risk.

**Operational risk**

Operational risk is defined as the risk arising from inadequate or failed internal systems, processes, controls,
people or resulting from internal/external events affecting the operation of our business. The Group has an active
programme in place to identify, assess and manage operational risks in line with the defined risk management
framework. Day to day operational risk management resides with management whilst risk teams in each region
oversee risk management activities. Operational risk is overseen by management, Executive Committee, regional
and Group Risk Committees and the Investor Board.

**Information and data risk**

Information and data risk is defined as the risk of financial loss, litigation, reputation damage or regulatory
sanctions resulting from poor data management, inappropriate data privacy, inadequate management of records
and information lifecycle and inability to protect data, system and information from unauthorized access
management, threats, cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities.

The introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) across the EU in May 2018 has led to
significant changes in compliance requirements for all firms that process data. The Group has enhanced its data
privacy controls to achieve compliance via a Group wide GDPR programme. Information and data risk is overseen
by the Executive Committee, regional and Group Risk Committees and the Investor Board.

**Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost (continued)**

For the Group, the fair value of the acquired portfolios is determined using a discounted cash flow model with
unobservable inputs which are classified as level 3 measurements. The Senior and the Senior Secured Notes are
publicly traded instruments whose value can be obtained from public sources; as a result these are classified as
level 1.

The fair value of non-financial instruments has been considered and it was determined that the fair value is
materially equal to their carrying value therefore no additional disclosure has been made.

**Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value**

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

  - The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded
on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices (includes listed
redeemable notes, bills of exchange, debentures and perpetual notes).

  - The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are
determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis
using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.

  - The fair value of the portfolios is calculated by discounting the net forecast cash flows. The unobservable
inputs in determining the fair value are the discount rate and service cost percentage which differ for
portfolios that are not deemed as “paying” at the point of acquisition and those that are deemed as
“paying”. A “paying” portfolio is determined at the point of acquisition based on the proportion of
accounts within that portfolio that are set up on a payment plan. The discount rates have been determined
from benchmarking. The service cost percentage is the percentage used to discount the gross cash flows
to net and is based on historical information on costs to collect.

  - The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not
available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration
of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves
derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Foreign exchange swaps are
measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield
curves derived from quoted interest rates.

**Fair value measurements recognised in the Statement of Financial Position**

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial
recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

  - Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities;

  - Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived
from prices); and

  - Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the
asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**31.** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

**a)** **Defined benefit schemes**

The Group has defined benefit pension obligations through its DACH and Nordic businesses.

**31 December** **31 December**

**2019** **2018**
**£000** **£000**

**Defined benefit pension net liabilities**
DACH ............................................................................................................ 6,457 5,262
Nordics .......................................................................................................... 3,292 2,374

**Total ..............................................................................................................** **9,749** **7,636**

**DACH**

The German defined benefit pension obligations in relation to the DACH business are provided through the
Groups German subsidiary, Lowell Financial Services GmbH. Pension obligations were calculated in accordance
with the requirements set out in IAS 19. An interest rate of between 1.7% and 2.2% (2018: 1.7% and 2.8%),
depending on the group of beneficiaries, was used for this purpose. The defined benefit obligation arising from
the defined benefit plans was determined in accordance with IAS 19. The calculations took into account estimated
increases in pensions and salaries as well as an employee turnover rate. Pension increases were estimated at 1.0%
to 1.5% (2018: 1.0 to 1.5%), salary increases at 0.0% to 2.0% (2018: 0.0% to 2.0%), and the employee turnover
rate in a range from 0.0% to 2.0% (2018: 0.0% to 2.0%). The employee turnover rate, in particular, depends on
the age of the pension beneficiaries. Mortality and invalidity rates were measured for the German companies using
the 2005 G Heubeck mortality tables.

The pension plan for one of the former members of the Executive Board of Lowell Financial Services GmbH
includes a retirement pension entitlement when the beneficiary reaches the age of 60. This retirement pension is
equivalent to up to 75% of the average fixed salary over the five years immediately prior to retirement. The
pension entitlement for two former employees of GFKL PayProtect GmbH comprises a retirement pension to be
paid when the beneficiary reaches the age of 65. Following the transfer of employees from the ERGO Group,
Sirius Inkasso GmbH recognised provisions for pensions for the first time in 2006. The pension entitlement
comprises a lifelong retirement pension paid when the beneficiary retires from the service of the entity upon
reaching the age of 65. A total of 13 employees at Sirius Inkasso GmbH have the benefit of this pension
entitlement. Pension entitlements have also been granted to employees of Proceed Collection Services GmbH as
a result of the transfer of 19 employees from Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG (now UniCredit Bank AG).

The net liability is calculated as follows:


**31 December** **31 December**

**2019** **2018**
**£000** **£000**

Present value of unfunded defined benefit obligation ................................... 9,189 8,050

**31.** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)**

The following table shows the changes in the defined benefit obligation:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2019** **2018**
**£000** **£000**

**Opening balance of defined benefit obligation ..........................................** **8,050** **8,419**

Currency translation adjustments .................................................................. (400) 58

**Closing balance of defined benefit obligation............................................** **9,189** **8,050**


The plan assets offset against the defined benefit obligation which are measured at fair value. The change in plan
assets were as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2019** **2018**
**£000** **£000**

**Opening balance of plan assets ...................................................................** **2,788** **2,714**

Currency translation adjustments .................................................................. (136) 21

**Closing balance of plan assets .....................................................................** **2,732** **2,788**


Since the plan assets have been pledged as collateral, they are netted against the present value of the unfunded
defined benefit obligation. The plan assets are insurance policies entered into by the Group. These assets have
been pledged to the beneficiaries, resulting in a netting requirement under IAS 19. Contributions to the plan assets
over the next year are expected to amount to £70k (£81k at 31 December 2018).

Movements in the year on provision for pensions were as follows:

**Year ended** **Year ended**

**a)** **Defined benefit schemes (continued)**

A quantitative sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions as of 31 December 2019 is as shown below:

**31 December**

**2019**
**£000**
**Interest rate**
Increase 0.5% ............................................................................................................................ (820)
Decrease 0.5% ........................................................................................................................... 944

**Salary trend**
Increase 0.5% ............................................................................................................................ 157

**Benefits trend**
Increase 0.5% ............................................................................................................................ 749
Decrease 0.5% ........................................................................................................................... (671)

The sensitivity analyses above were determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined
benefit obligation as a result of realised changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
The sensitivity analyses change key assumptions in isolation. As it is unlikely that changes in assumptions will
occur individually, the results above may not be representative of the actual change in defined benefit obligation.

The following payments are expected to be made in the future years out of the defined benefit plan obligation:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2019** **2018**
**£000** **£000**

Within the next 12 months ............................................................................ 219 220

Between 5 and 10 years ................................................................................. 1,452 1,416
More than 10 years ........................................................................................ 10,665 12,500

**Total expected payments .............................................................................** **13,274** **15,067**


The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 20 years (31 December
2018: 20 years).

**Nordics**

The defined benefit scheme in the Nordics is located in the Norwegian subsidiary Lowell Norge AS.

The net liability is calculated as follows:

in the UK. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of
trustees.

The total cost charged to income of £8.3m (2018: £5.2m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by
the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GARFUNKELUX HOLDCO 2 S.A.**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

To the sole shareholder of
Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A.
488 route de Longwy
L-1940 Luxembourg

**REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE**

**Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements**

**_Opinion_**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (the
“Group”), which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 31 December 2018, and the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,
including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2018 and of its consolidated financial performance and its
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of
23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July
2016 and ISAs are further described in the “Responsibilities of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” for the audit of the
consolidated financial statements” section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with
the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA
Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those
ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.

**_Other matter - The impact of uncertainties due to Britain exiting the European Union on our audit_**

Uncertainties related to the effects of Brexit are relevant to understanding our audit of the consolidated financial
statements. All audits assess and challenge the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Directors, such
as recoverability of intangible assets, goodwill, receivables and deferred taxes, and related disclosures and the
appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. All of these
depend on assessments of the future economic environment and the Group’s future prospects and performance.

Brexit is one of the most significant economic events for the UK, and at the date of this report its effects are
subject to unprecedented levels of uncertainty of outcomes, with the full range of possible effects unknown. We
applied a standardised firm-wide approach in response to that uncertainty when assessing the Group’s future
prospects and performance. However, no audit should be expected to predict the unknowable factors or all possible
future implications for a company and this is particularly the case in relation to Brexit.

**_Other information_**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
stated in the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our
report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the


-----

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GARFUNKELUX HOLDCO 2 S.A.**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

**_Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements_**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board
of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**_Responsibilities of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements_**

The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of “Réviseur
d’Entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the
CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Group’s internal control.

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

  - Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of “Réviseur
d’Entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé”. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

  - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

  - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.

consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Corporate information**

The consolidated financial statements of Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (together “The Group”)
for the year ended 31 December 2018 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of Directors on
10 April 2019. Under Luxembourg Law, the consolidated financial statements are approved by the shareholder at
the Annual General Meeting. Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. (the Company or the parent) is incorporated as an S.A.
(Société Anonyme) and domiciled in Luxembourg. The registered office is located at 488 route de Longwy, in
Luxembourg Ville.

The Group is principally engaged in the provision of credit management services. Information regarding the Group
structure is presented in note 14. Information on other related party transactions is presented in note 32.

**Reclassification of prior year presentation**

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These
reclassifications have no effect on the reported loss for the period. As a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 on
1 January 2018, an adjustment has been made to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (“SCI”)
for the year ended 31 December 2017 to reclassify net portfolio write up to income. Previously net portfolio write
up was presented within revenue and operating expenses. This adjustment moved £4.5m from operating expenses
to net portfolio write up and had no impact on either the balance sheet or any KPIs disclosed in these financial
statements.

**General information and basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair
value. Those standards have been applied consistently to the historical periods. The financial year is the calendar
year.

**Functional and presentation currency**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are prepared in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its “Functional Currency”). For the purposes of these consolidated financial
statements, the results are prepared in Sterling, (the Group’s “Presentational Currency”). All amounts have been
rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.

_Change in entity functional currency_

As a result of the acquisition of the Carve-out Business from Intrum in the year, together with associated funds
raised, the functional currency of two of the Group’s holding entities, Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. and Garfunkelux
Holdco 3 S.A., has changed from Sterling to Euro. Consequently, the equity balance of Garfunkelux Holdco 2
S.A. has been re-translated using the foreign exchange rate ruling on the date of the change (20 March 2018). This
has a presentational impact only in the Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. consolidated financial statements, with retranslated equity being higher and the difference going to the translation reserve.

**Adoption of new and revised standards**

The following new accounting standards became effective for years commencing on or after 1 January 2018 and
have been adopted in the current year. These amendments did not have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective 1 January 2018. Business model analysis, contract review and
segmented, detailed correlation and causation testing were undertaken at a regional level, in conjunction with a
third party specialist. As a result of this analysis, no correlation between the macro economic factors and future
collections performance was identified. This outcome is in line with management’s expectations given the nature
of the Group’s existing portfolio investments is underpinned by predominantly non-paying accounts. As part of
the extensive correlation and causation testing, the following macroeconomic variables were assessed;
unemployment, disposable income, household indebtedness, inflation and other factors. The introduction of IFRS
9 did not have a material impact on the Group.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Adoption of new and revised standards (continued)**

IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective from 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 established a five
step approach to accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. Contracts relating to third party contingent
collection services (“3PC”) and other service contracts were reviewed by the Group against the five steps of IFRS
15. Revenue is earned by the Group through commission based contracts and fee based contracts. In a commission
based contract revenue is based on a % commission of the payments received from clients and in a fee based
contract revenue is based on agreed upon fees. The introduction of IFRS 15 did not have a material impact on the
Group.

IFRS 2 – Classifications and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions.

The following new Standard is in issue and has been endorsed by the EU but is not yet effective for these
consolidated financial statements.

IFRS 16 – Leases – effective 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on balance sheet accounting model for
lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease
liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The only exemptions to this are short-term leases and
leases of low value items.

The Group has completed a comprehensive project across all regions to review its leasing arrangements in light
of IFRS 16. On application from 1 January 2019, IFRS 16 is expected to have the following key impacts on the
Group’s financial statements:

  - The Group will recognise new right-of-use assets of c£49m and lease liabilities of c£54m for its operating
leases as at 1 January 2019. These are primarily building, car and IT related leases.

  - Previously, the Group recognised operating lease expense on a straight line basis over the term of the
lease. Under IFRS 16, this operating lease expense will be replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use
asset and interest expense on the lease liabilities. As a result, profit before tax is expected to reduce by
c£1.0m in 2019.

The Group will apply IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 and intends to apply the modified retrospective approach,
with the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 being recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at
1 January 2019. There will be no restatement of comparative information. It should be noted that figures stated
above are preliminary and subject to change during the course of 2019.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:

  - Power over the investee (i.e. existing voting rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee);

  - Exposure, or rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and

  - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its return.

Generally there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support its presumption and
when the Group has less than a majority of voting rights or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee including:

  - The contractual arrangements with the other investee;

  - Rights arising from the contractual arrangements; and

  - The Group voting rights and potential voting rights.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Going concern**

The Group’s business activities are set out in the SCI and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (“SFP”)
on pages F-100 and F-101 respectively. In addition, note 28 to these consolidated financial statements includes
the Group’s financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Cash EBITDA of the Group is an industry accepted measure of a business’s asset base and cash flow
generation. The Group has demonstrated strong performance during the year ended 31 December 2018 with Cash
EBITDA of £413.5m, an increase of £114.2m on the year ended 31 December 2017, including £86.3m
contribution from the Nordic region. The Group is in a net asset position of £213.0m at 31 December 2018.

The business as a whole is cash generative before portfolio acquisitions, generating cash of £349.5m in the year
ended 31 December 2018, with operating cash flow after portfolio acquisitions being negative by £27.9m as a
result of investment for growth. The Group continually monitors its cash flow requirements to ensure that enough
cash is available to meet its commitments. No additional funding requirements over and above currently available
facilities are forecast in the medium term.

The Group has four main sources of funding at 31 December 2018, €365m, £565m, €415m, €530m and
SEK1,280m of listed Senior Secured loan notes (“notes”), £230m of listed Senior loan notes, a €455m RCF and
£262.0m securitisation funding. There are covenants on the funding which are detailed in note 19. No maintenance
covenants have been breached in 2018.

The Group has completed a comprehensive review of the potential impact of Brexit, including assessing the
potential impact on customers, clients and funding. This review did not identify any material issues which would
affect the going concern of either the UK business or the Group.

There are long term business plans and short term forecasts in place which are reviewed and updated on a regular
basis by management. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. They consequently adopt the going concern basis of
accounting in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

**Foreign currency**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective Functional Currencies of Group entities at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the Functional Currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling
at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the SCI. Non-monetary assets
and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange
rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are
stated at fair value are retranslated to the Functional Currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair
value was determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
consolidation, are translated to the Group’s Presentational Currency (Sterling) at foreign exchange rates ruling at
the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the
period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange
differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control,
joint control or significant influence (as the case may be) is lost, the entire accumulated amount in the Foreign
Currency Translation Reserve, net of amounts previously attributed to non-controlling interests, is reclassified to
profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while still retaining control, the relevant proportion of the accumulated
amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an
associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while still retaining significant influence or joint
control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Business combinations**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for
each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of completion) of assets given, liabilities
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. At
acquisition, non-controlling interest (“NCI”) is measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in
profit or loss as incurred.

Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are
adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below).

All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are
accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRS standards. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration
classified as equity are not recognised.

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition
under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of
deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are
recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits)
respectively.

On a business combination the portfolio investments are recalculated to fair value using an appropriate discount
rate at the date of acquisition, calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date.

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete
information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of
one year from the date of acquisition.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the
acquisition date). Goodwill is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to
benefit from that business combination. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Total goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Additionally, if there is evidence of impairment in any CGU,
goodwill allocated to that CGU is also tested for impairment.

The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs
to sell, and value in use. Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast
cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate discount rate.

If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on
a pro-rated basis in relation to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the goodwill attributable to that subsidiary is included when calculating the profit or
loss on disposal.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method**

_Finance revenue on acquired portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments represents the yield from acquired portfolio investments, net of VAT where
applicable. Acquired portfolio investments are held to collect contractual cash flows of payments of solely
principal and interest, recognising them at amortised cost and in line with IFRS 9.

The effective interest rate (“EIR”) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts of the acquired
portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition, (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). These
estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the estimated remaining life of the portfolios and range from
84 months to 120 months. An initial EIR is determined at the acquisition of the portfolio investment, following
this there is a short period that is required to adjust the EIR due to the complexity of the portfolios acquired.
Reassessing and changing the EIR in this way does not have a material impact on the financial statements.

Acquired portfolio investments are acquired at a deep discount and classified as purchased or credit impaired
(“POCI”) in line with IFRS 9. As a result the estimated future cash flows, and hence EIR, reflect the likely credit
losses within each portfolio.

Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cash flows be deemed greater than
previous estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period to derive future cash receipts. The difference in
carrying value following an enhanced collection forecast is recognised in the net portfolio write up line item within
income, with subsequent reversals also recorded in this line. This line represents the net impairment gains on
portfolio investments.

As part of the acquisition accounting around the purchase of Metis Bidco Limited by Simon Bidco Limited on
13 October 2015 the portfolio investments were uplifted to their fair value at the date of acquisition. The portfolio
fair value release represents the unwinding of this fair value uplift (see note 15). This uplift is being unwound in
line with the standard profile of a gross ERC curve of these portfolios.

_Service revenue_

Service revenue represents amounts receivable for tracing and debt collecting services (commissions and fees)
provided to third party clients including collection lawyers, net of VAT where applicable. Performance obligations
within service contracts are the collection of cash and hence these are satisfied when Group collects on debt.
Payment is due from clients shortly after cash is collected on their behalf. Revenue is recognised when
performance obligations are satisfied.

**Impairment of acquired portfolio investments**

Acquired portfolio investments are reviewed for indications of impairment in accordance with the IFRS 9 forward
looking expected credit loss (“ECL”) model. As the Group’s portfolio investments are classified as POCI assets,
lifetime ECL is included in the calculation of EIR. The estimation of expected credit losses includes an assessment
of forward-looking economic assumptions. Impairment represents changes to carrying values, discounted at the
EIR, of the portfolio investments as a result of reassessments of the estimated future cash flows. These are
recognised in net portfolio write up in the SCI.

The impairment adjustment is calculated by discounting regularly revised cash flow forecasts developed for each
individual portfolio investment, at the initially set EIR. The cash flow forecasts, which represent the undiscounted
value of the ERC of our portfolio investments at a given point in time, are calculated over the portfolio expected
useful life, based on previous month’s collections and portfolio performance information collated within our
proprietary valuation model.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Consolidated SFP when the Group becomes
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

_Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss_

This category relates to financial assets and liabilities that must be recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
Such assets or liabilities are initially recognised at cost, which at this point equates to fair value. They must be
measured subsequently at fair value.

The main assets and liabilities in the Group falling into this category are derivative financial instruments that do
not fall under the scope of hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9.

_Loans and receivables_

Acquired portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value. The
portfolios are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the EIR method.

The portfolio investment is analysed between current and non-current in the SFP. The current asset is determined
using the expected cash flows arising in the next twelve months after the SFP date. The residual amount is
classified as non-current.

Portfolio investments include litigation costs which represent upfront fees paid during the litigation process,
expected to be recoverable from the customer and added to the customer account balance to be recovered at a later
date.

Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market are classified as ‘Trade and other receivables’. Trade and other receivables are measured at
amortised cost using the EIR method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective
interest rate, except for short-term receivables (including Trade receivables) when the recognition of interest
would be immaterial.

The Group has forward flow agreements in place in relation to the future acquisition of portfolio investments. The
fair value and subsequent amortised cost of portfolios acquired under these agreements are determined on the
same basis as the Group’s other acquired portfolio investments.

_Impairment of financial assets_

Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit or loss / SCI (“FVTPL”), are assessed for
indicators of impairment at each period end. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that,
as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated
future cash flows of the investment have been affected.

_Derecognition of financial assets_

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another
entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues
to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability
for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a
transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises collateralised
borrowings for the proceeds received.

_Financial liabilities and equity_

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the
substance of the contractual arrangement.

_Financial liabilities_

All financial liabilities held by the Group are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, except for those
measured at fair value through the SCI, e.g. derivative liabilities. The Group derecognises financial liabilities
when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

_Derivative financial instruments_

The Group does not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Derivative financial instruments have been used for hedging. As of the balance sheet date, they relate to hedges
taken out to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into, and
subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the
SCI immediately. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value
is negative.

**Fair value measurements**

The fair value of financial instruments is determined in accordance with IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement), as
described in note 28.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event, if it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and if a reliable estimate of the
amount of the obligation can be made.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the SFP date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a
provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the
discounted present value of those cash flows.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third
party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the
amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

**Pensions**

_Defined benefit pensions_

The Group provides defined benefit pension plans through some of its German and Nordic subsidiaries. Provisions
for pensions are calculated pursuant to IAS 19. Actuarial models are used to calculate the provisions for pensions
and the related pension expenses. These calculations use various assumptions such as current actuarial
probabilities (discount factors, increase in cost of living etc.), assumptions regarding turnover based on age and
years of service as well as experience-based assumptions concerning the probability of occurrence of pension
payments, annuity payments or endowment payments. The probabilities used in the inputs may deviate from actual
developments due to changes in market and economic conditions. Sensitivity analysis is used to determine the
financial effects of the deviations in the significant inputs.

_Defined contribution pensions_

The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for the benefit of its employees. Contributions payable are
charged to the SCI in the period they are payable.

**Leases**

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant
lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic
benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as
an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, the aggregate benefit of incentives is
recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

_Current tax_

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported
in the SCI because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end.

_Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable
profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each SFP date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or
the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the SFP date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the SCI, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

_VAT_

Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of VAT, except:

  - Where the VAT incurred on purchased goods and services cannot be reclaimed from the tax authorities,
in which case the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of the asset or as an expense.

  - Receivables and liabilities are stated with the amount of VAT included.

The VAT amount reclaimable from, or payable to, the tax authorities is reported under receivables or liabilities in
the balance sheet.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Collection activity costs**

Collection activity costs represent direct staff costs and the direct third party costs in providing services as a debt
collection agency or collecting debts on acquired portfolio investments; examples include printing and postage,
third party commissions, search and trace costs, litigation, telephone and SMS costs. Costs are recognised as
incurred.

**Current versus non-current classification**

The Group presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position based on current/noncurrent classification.

An asset is current when it is:

  - Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;

  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;

  - Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or

  - Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least
twelve months after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

  - It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;

  - It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;

  - It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or

  - There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the
reporting period.

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits with a term from inception of three months
or less, less bank overdrafts where there is a right to offset. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to
the extent that there is no right to offset with cash balances in the same currency.

The Group holds cash on behalf of third parties as part of its collection activities, and in relation to its securitisation
facilities. This restricted cash is shown within cash with a corresponding liability recognised in other payables.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Share-based Payments**

Some employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based
payments settled by the main shareholder of the Group as described in note 27.

IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires an entity to account for a transaction in which it either:

  - Receives goods or services when another entity in the same group (or a shareholder of any group entity)
has the obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction; or

  - Has an obligation to settle a share-based payment transaction when another entity in the same group
receives the goods or services;

unless the transaction is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the entity
receiving them.

**_Equity-settled transactions_**

To the extent a cost is recognised, the cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date
when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model.

The cost is recognised in employee benefits expense together with a corresponding increase in equity (other capital
reserves), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the
vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the SCI for a period represents the
movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

In the consolidated financial statements of the Group, the share-based payment arrangements described in note 27
have been classified as equity settled transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with
the employees for services it receives.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Hardware 3 to 5 years
Office equipment 3 to 15 years
Leasehold improvements Life of lease (0 to 15 years)

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the SCI.

Borrowing costs are added to the costs of an asset provided it is a qualifying asset pursuant to IAS 23.

**Intangible assets**

Separately acquired or internally generated intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and
any recognised impairment loss.

An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal
project) is recognised only if technical feasibility has been demonstrated such that the asset will be available for
use or sale, that there is an intention and ability to use or sell the asset, that it will generate future economic benefit,
and that the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured. Where no internally
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

Software 3 to 5 years Straight line
Licences 1 to 5 years Straight line
Trademarks 15 years Straight line
Customer relationships 5 to 10 years Expected life of the underlying contract
(Collection profile)

Development costs are not amortised until the project they relate to is complete and goes live. Once the project is
live the costs are moved from development costs to the relevant category and amortised over the applicable useful
economic life.

Assets are reviewed for signs of impairment at least annually and more frequently if necessary. Impairments are
recognised where the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future economic benefit.

**2.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The reported results of the Group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie
the preparation of the Group’s financial statements. IFRS requires the Directors, in preparing the Group’s financial
statements, to select suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently, and make judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent.

The judgements and associated estimates used in applying the Group’s accounting policies that are considered by
the Directors to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial position are detailed below. The use of
estimates, assumptions or models that differ from those adopted by the Group would affect its reported results.

**Portfolio investment valuation**

Portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value and are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.

The calculation of the EIR for each portfolio is based on the estimation of future cash flows. These cash flows are
estimates and are therefore inherently judgemental. These Estimated Remaining Collections (“ERCs”) are based
upon historical collections data from other portfolios with similar features such as type and quantum of debt, or
age. The calculation of the ERC for each portfolio investment is inherently judgemental as it involves the
estimation of future cash flows based upon collections data from the individual debt owed.

Actual cash flows are regularly compared to estimates to assess the accuracy of previous forecasts.

An uplift or reduction in expected future cash flows of 1% would increase or decrease the closing carrying value
of portfolio investments at 31 December 2018 by £15.4m (31 December 2017: £9.6m).

If the forecast portfolio collections exceed initial estimates, an adjustment is recorded as an increase to the carrying
value of the portfolio and is included in income as a portfolio write up.

**Goodwill and valuation of intangible assets**

The Group recognises goodwill on the acquisition of businesses as discussed in the significant accounting policies.
Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of its net assets. The determination
of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those
financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired investment portfolios
where valuations reflect estimates of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the
goodwill arising and to the post acquisition performance of the acquisition.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an
estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of the value in use
requires an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU after a suitable discount rate has been
applied to calculate present value. This inherently involves a number of judgements in that cash flow forecasts
are prepared for periods that are beyond the normal requirement of management reporting, and the appropriate
discount rate relevant to the business is an estimate.

See notes 10 and 11 for further details.

**3.** **SEGMENTAL REPORTING**

**Segmentation**

IFRS 8 requires operating segment reporting to be based on information provided to the chief operating decision
maker which, in this case, is considered to be the Group Executive Committee. Information is presented to the
Group Executive Committee on the basis of the three main regions within which the Group operates – the UK,
DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Croatia) and Nordic (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and
Estonia) regions. This is in line with the management of the Group. Holding company costs include amounts
recognised in relation to holding companies introduced to the Group on the acquisitions of the UK, DACH and
Nordic regions.

The UK, DACH and Nordic operating segments derive revenues from the acquisition and collection of consumer
debt portfolios and receivables management.

All revenues are derived from external customers.

**10.** **SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS OF SUBSIDIARIES**

**Acquisition of Carve-out Business from Intrum**

On 20 March 2018, the Group acquired 100% share in Fair Pay Please AS and Lindorff Sverige AB, which
represent the Carve-out Business from Intrum for €741 million (£647 million). The acquisition was made through
Lowell Nordics Oy (formerly Hansa Bidco Oy, formerly Pofidax Oy), an indirect subsidiary of the Company.

The carve-out comprises Lindorff’s entire business in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden as well as Intrum
Justitia’s entire business in Norway and was specified by the European Commission as a condition of the
combination of the two companies in 2017.

The combined business will benefit from greater scale and diversification in terms of broader geographic reach
and a more balanced revenue mix together with a complementary and client-focused product offering.

In the nine months to 31 December 2018 the Carve-out Business contributed £9.7m profit to the consolidated net
loss for the period and £142.9m to consolidated income. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018,
management estimates that Group income would have been £42.2m higher and Group net loss would have been
£3.2m lower. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined
provisionally, that arose on the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on
1 January 2018.

_Provisional identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed_

The following table summarises the provisional recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
the date of acquisition.

**Recognised values on acquisition** **£000**

**Acquiree’s net assets at the acquisition date:**
Property, plant and equipment ................................................................................................. 1,537
Intangible assets ....................................................................................................................... 57,696
Portfolio investments ............................................................................................................... 387,474
Other financial assets ............................................................................................................... 814
Trade and other receivables ..................................................................................................... 44,453
Deferred tax assets ................................................................................................................... 7,675
Income tax receivables ............................................................................................................ 220
Cash and cash equivalents ....................................................................................................... 51,860
Trade and other payables ......................................................................................................... (47,976)
Provisions for pensions ............................................................................................................ (2,415)
Provisions ................................................................................................................................ (443)
Borrowings .............................................................................................................................. (19,140)

Deferred tax liabilities ............................................................................................................. (11,016)
**Total identifiable net assets acquired ...................................................................................** **464,536**

Fair values have been measured on a provisional basis. If new information obtained within one year of the date of
acquisition about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of the acquisition identifies adjustments to the
above amounts, or any additional provisions that existed at the date of acquisition then the accounting for the
acquisition will be revisited.

No increase or impairment of value was recognised for trade receivables at the acquisition date.

_Consideration transferred_

The following table summarises the acquisition date fair value of each major class of consideration transferred.

**Recognised values on acquisition** **£000**

Settlement of existing financial arrangements ......................................................................... 266,453
**Total consideration transferred in cash ...............................................................................** **646,818**

_Measurement of fair value_

The valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of material assets acquired were as follows:

**Assets acquired Valuation technique**

Customer relationships Income approach
Non-performing loans Income approach
Software Market comparison and cost technique

No contingent consideration or contingent liabilities remain in respect of the acquisition as at 31 December 2018.

_Goodwill_

Provisional goodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognised as follows:

**Recognised values on acquisition** **£000**

Consideration transferred ...................................................................................................... 646,818
Fair value of identifiable net assets ....................................................................................... (464,536)
**Goodwill (note 11) ...............................................................................................................** **182,282**

Goodwill value comprises the skills and technical talent of the Carve-out Business’s workforce and expected
synergies arising from the acquisition which is not separately recognised.

The Group incurred acquisition related costs of £12.5m on legal fees and due diligence costs. These costs have
been included in other operating expenses in FY18 and FY17, see note 4.

For accounting purposes, the effective date of the acquisition was 31 March 2018 as there was an immaterial
difference between the acquisition date and the month end date.

None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are
expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to three
aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes. The CGUs identified are the UK, comprising of all subsidiary companies operated in the
UK owned by Simon Bidco Limited, DACH, consisting of all subsidiary companies operated in DACH owned
by Lowell Holding GmbH and Nordics, consisting of all subsidiary companies operated in the Nordic region
owned by Lowell Nordics Oy.

Foreign currency denominated goodwill is retranslated at each balance sheet date and gives rise to the currency
translation effect shown above.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might
be impaired.

The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and
expected changes to collections and direct costs during the forecast period. The Group uses cash flow forecasts
from the latest budgets, prepared for the next four years and extrapolates these forecasts into perpetuity, using
growth rates in line with management’s expectations of future growth. Given the proximity of the acquisition of
the Nordic CGU, purchase price is still considered to be an accurate assessment of fair value less costs to sell and
hence recoverable amount.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGU’s are
based upon the subsidiary group’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and are as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2018** **2017**
**£000** **£000**

UK CGU .................................................................................................... 7.84% 6.36%
DACH CGU ............................................................................................... 5.54% 4.80%


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**11.** **GOODWILL (CONTINUED)**

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent detailed financial budgets approved by
management for the next four years. The forecasts assume growth rates in acquisitions which in turn drive the
forecast collections and cost figures.

The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGU’s carrying value. Each
sensitivity has been performed independently.

**UK CGU**

Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cash flows of 30% would result in an impairment at
31 December 2018. An increase in WACC of 2.25 percentage points to 10.09% would result in an impairment at
31 December 2018.

**DACH CGU**

Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cash flows of 36% would result in an impairment at
31 December 2018. An increase in WACC of 1.62 percentage points to 7.16% would result in an impairment at
31 December 2018.

There are two covenant measures under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes; Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
which must be at least 2:1 and Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, which cannot exceed 4.5:1. Both
covenants are incurrence covenants.

The Senior Secured Notes are secured on the assets, share pledges and intra-group receivables of the Group and
are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (EUROMTF).

**Senior Unsecured Notes (“Notes”)**

On 19 October 2015 the Company issued £230m 11.0% Senior Notes due 2023. The interest on the Notes is

least 2:1. Again, this is an incurrence covenant only.

**Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”)**

On 2 May 2018 the Group RCF commitment was increased to €455m (2017: €200m). The RCF has a variable
interest rate linked to LIBOR/EURIBOR and a quarterly commitment fee calculated on the undrawn facility.

Any material company or other member of the Group, which becomes a guarantor of the RCF is required (subject
to agreed security principles) to grant security over certain of its material assets and (if wholly owned by another
member or members of the Group) to have its shares (or equivalent ownership interests) secured in favour of the
Security Agent.

There is one covenant measure under the terms of the RCF additional to the covenant measures under the Senior
Secured Notes as follows: if the aggregate amount of all loan utilisations exceed an amount equal to 30% of the
total commitments, the Group is required to confirm whether or not the Leverage Ratio exceeds 7:1.

relation to a Shareholders’ Meeting. The Shareholders and the BU holders may only use voting forms provided
by the Company and which contain at least the place, date and time of the meeting, the agenda of the meeting, the
proposal submitted to the decision of the meeting, as well as for each proposal three boxes allowing the
Shareholder and the BU holder to vote in favour, against, or abstain from voting on each proposed resolution by
ticking the appropriate box.

**Return of Capital**

In the event of a dissolution and liquidation of the Company, any liquidation surplus shall be distributed in the
following order:

  - The holders of the BUs shall receive an amount corresponding to: a) the Issue Price of the BUs held by
them plus; b) the amount of any accrued but unpaid BU Entitlement; and

  - Subject to the terms of any Arrangement, any remaining liquidation surplus shall be distributed to
Shareholders pro-rata to the number of shares held by them.

**Distributions**

From net profits of the Company determined in accordance with Luxembourg Law, five per cent shall be deducted
and allocated to a legal reserve fund. That deduction will cease to be mandatory when the amount of the legal
reserve fund reaches one tenth of the Company’s nominal capital.

Subject to the provisions of Luxembourg Law, the Company Articles and any Arrangement, the Company may
by Shareholders’ Resolution declare distributions to Shareholders pro rata to the number of shares held by them.

Subject to the provisions of Luxembourg Law, the Company Articles and any Arrangement, the Board of Directors
may pay interim dividends to Shareholders pro rata to the number of shares held by them.

The Shareholders and the BU holders, where applicable, are entitled to participate in a Shareholders’ Meeting by

**27.** **SHARE BASED PAYMENTS**

On 13 October 2015, the main shareholder of the Company – Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. entered into a
share-based payment arrangement with certain managers of the Group (the “Garfunkelux Group managers”).

Under this agreement, the Garfunkelux Group managers entered into a nominee agreement with Garfunkelux
Nominee S.à r.l. (“Nominee”), pursuant to which the Nominee is the registered shareholder of the shareholder
instruments as nominee for the Garfunkelux Group managers and these managers are the beneficial owners of the
shareholder instruments held by Nominee. The Garfunkelux Group managers subscribed for shares in
Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of
grant.

The Garfunkelux Group managers further agreed, in the same agreement, to sell back to Garfunkelux Invest
S.à r.l., the main shareholder of Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., the shares owned in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l.
in the event they cease to be an employee and/or a corporate officer of the Group. The selling price of the shares
is determined on the basis of a number of conditions including the service period and whether the Garfunkelux
Group manager qualifies as a good leaver or a bad leaver. The sale price of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1
S.à r.l. owned by the Garfunkelux Group managers will be settled in cash.

In the consolidated financial statements of the Group, this arrangement has been classified as equity settled
transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with the Garfunkelux Group managers.
However since amounts paid by the Garfunkelux Group managers for the subscription of the shares in
Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. are at fair value, the awards have no material fair value at grant date and therefore
there is no expense recognised in the SCI for the year or previous year.

**Financial risk management objectives**


As a result of its normal business activities, the Group has exposure to the following risks:

  - **Strategic risk (including Investor Relations risk, Market Dynamics risk, Mergers & Acquisitions risk,**
Major Initiatives risk, Strategic Planning risk and Pricing risk);

  - **Financial risk (including Credit & Counterparty risk, Liquidity & Capital risk, Market risk (including**
Interest Rate risk and Foreign Exchange risk), Insurance risk, Tax risk and Reporting & Forecasting risk);

  - **Operational risk (including IT risk, People risk, Conduct risk, Third Party risk, Business Operations &**
Processes risk, Business Continuity risk and Physical security risk);

  - **Compliance risk (including Regulatory risk, Financial Crime risk, Legal risk and CSR & Ethics risk);**
and

  - **Information & Data risk (including Information Security & Cyber Crime risk, Data & Modelling risk**
and Data Privacy risk).

This note presents information about the exposure of the Group to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives,

these financial statements. The Group manages these risks through the Group Executive Committee, Group Risk
Committee and Investor Board.

The Group has no exposure to equity markets and does not hold any speculative equity positions.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**28.** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**Strategic risk management**

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings resulting from poor or lack of clear strategy and execution, adverse business
decisions, and inadequate anticipation of emerging changes in the broader business, economic and political
environment, including changing competitive threats and disruptive innovations, internal or external. This
includes the risk of changes caused by market variables such as prices, type and timing of debt coming to the
market, i.e. the cost of consumer debt portfolios.

In bidding for consumer debt portfolios, the Group seeks to achieve a sufficient yield to cover both the cost of
collection and overhead costs, thereby minimising the risk of not recovering the cost of these portfolios. The
Group uses sophisticated pricing models along with extensive customer and market data to establish the
profitability of portfolios coming to market. The Group monitors its pricing assumptions through Investment
Committees (subsets of the Executive Committee).

The Group manages the unpredictability of the market through a number of financing structures. The Group has
in place €365m, £565m, €415m, €530m and SEK 1,280m of Senior Secured loan Notes, £230m of Senior loan
Notes, and a €455m RCF facility. At 31 December 2018 the RCF facility was £14.0m drawn down
(31 December 2017: £41m). This facility allows the Group the flexibility to bid on portfolios as and when they
come to market and are not restricted by cash flow constraints.

**Financial risk management**

**Credit and Counterparty risk management**

Credit and counterparty risk is the risk to earnings, financial loss arising from a counterparty default on contractual
obligations or risk to earnings, financial loss or capital impact from a customer failure to meet a contractual
repayment schedule.

The risk from the concentration of debtor credit risk is limited due to the high number of individual customer
balances and the relatively low value of each of the individual’s debts.

The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios.
All portfolios by their nature are impaired on acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections.
Carrying values are impaired when and if the underlying performance does not meet initial expectations. The
on-going risk is managed through utilising a comprehensive portfolio valuation model and building current
expectations of recoverability from information on debt types and customers into pricing assumptions and models.
An Investment Committee is in place which is attended by members of the Executive Committee as well as other
key members from across the business.

This committee is in place to scrutinise all aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational and compliance risk
through to the financial assumptions and maximum bid price.

The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements, which are net of
impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

The Group’s most significant exposure to credit risk is to portfolio investments. At 31 December 2018 the carrying
value by geography is shown below:

**Liquidity and Capital risk management**

Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability (or at excessive funding costs) to meet contractual or contingent
financial obligations (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as they arise, and could potentially impact an institution’s
financial condition or overall safety and soundness. Capital risk relates to the risk of holding insufficient capital
to absorb unexpected loss. The approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always
have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by continuously
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. At 31 December 2018, the Group had available undrawn committed
borrowing facilities of €415.7m (31 December 2017: €153.8m). See note 19 for further details on banking
facilities.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Group Executive Committee, which has
established an appropriate liquidity risk management approach for the management of the Group’s short, medium
and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining
adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and
actual cash flows, and by monitoring the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Details of additional
undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are set out on the next page.

The total RCF available of €431.5m has been translated at the year end at a rate of 0.894 at 31 December 2018.

**Capital risk management**

The Group’s objective in managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base to support current operations and
planned growth and so to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19 after
deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity (“SoCE”).

The Group Risk Committee reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the
committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.

**Interest rate risk management**

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings, income, valuation arising from changes in interest rates The Group has
minimised its risk against changes in interest rates by being predominantly funded by fixed rate Notes and share
capital.

The Group’s RCF has a variable interest rate and at 31 December 2018 this was £14m drawn down (31 December
2017: £41m). Interest is payable on the RCF at a maximum of 3.5% + LIBOR/EURIBOR. The Group also had
three floating rate note issuances in place at 31 December 2018 with principals of €415m, €530m and SEK 1,280m
and interest rates of 3.5% + EURIBOR, 4.5% + EURIBOR and 4.75% + STIBOR respectively, all with floors of
0%.

**Interest rate sensitivity analysis**

The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments
at the SFP date. A 2.5 percentage point increase or decrease represents management’s assessment of the
reasonably possible change in interest rates. If interest rates had been 2.5 percentage points higher and all other
variables were held constant, the Group’s loss for the year ended 31 December 2018 would be c£29.5m higher
(2017: c£8.8m higher). This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.

**Foreign exchange swap contracts**

The derivatives recognised at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 relate to OTC (“Over the Counter”)
foreign exchange derivatives that the Group concludes with its banking partners. In order to recognise the fair
value of these derivatives, the fair value calculation performed by the Group as of the balance sheet date is used,
which is based on the customary market method and is regularly compared with fair value calculations provided
by the counter parties. The fair value of foreign exchange swaps is determined by discounting expected future
cash flows over the residual term of the contract based on current market rates and the term structure of interest
rates.

**Foreign exchange risk management**

The Group has exposure to foreign exchange risk through its investments in overseas operations which have
functional currencies other than Sterling and foreign currency denominated assets/liabilities and transactions. The
Group is principally exposed to Euro (EUR), Swedish krona (SEK), Norwegian krone (NOK) and Danish krone
(DKK) and minimises its foreign currency risk by having both assets and liabilities in functional currencies other
than Sterling. As the assets and liabilities are matched where practical, the Group monitors and manages its
exposure. The carrying values of the Groups principle foreign currency denominated net assets are as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2018** **2017**
**£000** **£000**

**Net assets**

**Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis**

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase against Sterling exchange rates. This
represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity
analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated financial instruments and adjusts their
translation at the year end only for a change in foreign currency rates, holding all other variables constant.

**Insurance risk management**

The Group has a full program of insurance coverage in place, this includes polices for Directors and Officers,
Professional Indemnity and Cyber. Coverage is assessed and updated as required on an annual basis.

**Compliance risk**

Compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss or reputation damages
resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, ethical standards, prescribed practices, internal policies
and procedures and from fraud, corruption or bribery. The Group faces a number of regulations which are subject
to ongoing change. The Group has an active compliance programme in place with dedicated compliance teams in
each region. Compliance risk is overseen by the Executive Committee, Group Risk Committee and the Investor
Board.

In the UK, a number of entities are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). If the FCA deemed
the Group’s conduct and customer interaction to be poor or non-compliant it can impose a financial penalty and/or
financial redress for customers. The ultimate penalty would be the withdrawal of that company’s authorisation to
provide financial services. The Directors are not aware of any indication that this is a possibility and seek to
minimise the risk through initiatives such as the Lowell FAIR programme which enshrines the FCA’s six Treating
Customers Fairly principles around fair customer treatment in the Group’s day-to-day activity. Specifically, the
FAIR programme helps shape processes to achieve fair outcomes for customers, assessment of affordability and
monitoring and oversight to minimise conduct risk.

**Operational risk**

Operational risk is defined as the risk arising from inadequate or failed internal systems, processes, controls,
people or resulting from internal/external events affecting the operation of our business. The Group has an active
programme in place to identify, assess and manage operational risks in line with the defined risk management
framework. Day to day operational risk management resides with management whilst risk teams in each region
oversee risk management activities. Operational risk is overseen by management, Executive Committee, Group
Risk Committee and the Investor Board.

**Information and data risk**

Information and data risk is defined as the risk of financial loss, litigation, reputation damage or regulatory
sanctions resulting from poor data management, inappropriate data privacy, inadequate management of records
and information lifecycle and inability to protect data, system and information from unauthorized access
management, threats, cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities.

The introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) across the EU in May 2018 has led to
significant changes in compliance requirements for all firms that process data. The Group has enhanced its data
privacy controls to achieve compliance via a Group wide GDPR programme. Information and data risk is overseen
by the Executive Committee, Group Risk Committee and Investor Board.

**Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost (continued)**

For the Group, the fair value of the acquired portfolios is determined using a discounted cash flow model with
unobservable inputs and are classified as level 3 measurements. The Senior and the Senior Secured Notes are
publicly traded instruments whose value can be obtained from public sources; as a result these are classified as
level 1. The remaining financial assets and liabilities carried have a fair value equal to their carrying value.

The fair value of non-financial instruments have been considered and it was determined that the fair value is
materially equal to their carrying value therefore no additional disclosure has been made.

The fair value of the portfolios is calculated by discounting the net forecast cash flows. The unobservable inputs
in determining the fair value are the discount rate and service cost percentage which differ for portfolios that are
not deemed as “paying” at the point of acquisition and those that are deemed as “paying”. A “paying” portfolio is
determined at the point of acquisition based on the proportion of accounts within that portfolio that are set up on
a payment plan. The discount rates have been determined from benchmarking. The service cost percentage is the
percentage used to discount the gross cash flows to net and is based on historical information on costs to collect.

**Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value**

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows.

  - The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded
on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices (includes listed
redeemable notes, bills of exchange, debentures and perpetual notes).

  - The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are
determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis
using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments. The
acquired portfolio investments fair value is calculated using discounted net 84 month to 120 month
forecast cash flows.

  - The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not
available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration
of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves
derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Foreign exchange swaps are
measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield
curves derived from quoted interest rates.

**Fair value measurements recognised in the Statement of Financial Position**

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial
recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

  - Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities;

  - Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived
from prices); and

  - Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the
asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

**7,636** **5,705**

**DACH**

The German defined benefit pension obligations in relation to the DACH business are provided through the
Groups German subsidiary, Lowell Financial Services GmbH. Pension obligations were calculated in accordance
with the requirements set out in IAS 19. An interest rate of between 1.7% and 2.2% (2017: 1.5% and 2.0%),
depending on the group of beneficiaries, was used for this purpose. The defined benefit obligation arising from
the defined benefit plans was determined in accordance with IAS 19. The calculations took into account estimated
increases in pensions and salaries as well as an employee turnover rate. Pension increases were estimated at 1.0%
to 1.5% (2017: 1.0 to 1.5%), salary increases at 0.0% to 2.0% (2017: 0.0% to 2.0%), and the employee turnover
rate in a range from 0.0% to 2.0% (2017: 0.0% to 2.0%). The employee turnover rate, in particular, depends on
the age of the pension beneficiaries. Mortality and invalidity rates were measured for the German companies using
the 2005 G Heubeck mortality tables.

The pension plan for one of the former members of the Executive Board of Lowell Financial Services GmbH
includes a retirement pension entitlement when the beneficiary reaches the age of 60. This retirement pension is
equivalent to up to 75% of the average fixed salary over the five years immediately prior to retirement. The
pension entitlement for two former employees of GFKL PayProtect GmbH comprises a retirement pension to be
paid when the beneficiary reaches the age of 65. Following the transfer of employees from the ERGO Group,
Sirius Inkasso GmbH recognised provisions for pensions for the first time in 2006. The pension entitlement
comprises a lifelong retirement pension paid when the beneficiary retires from the service of the entity upon
reaching the age of 65. A total of 13 employees at Sirius Inkasso GmbH have the benefit of this pension
entitlement. Pension entitlements have also been granted to employees of Proceed Collection Services GmbH as
a result of the transfer of 19 employees from Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG (now UniCredit Bank AG).

The net liability is calculated as follows:

**Closing balance of plan assets ...............................................................** **2,788** **2,714**


Since the plan assets have been pledged as collateral, they are netted against the present value of the unfunded
defined benefit obligation. The plan assets are insurance policies entered into by the Group. These assets have
been pledged to the beneficiaries, resulting in a netting requirement under IAS 19. Contributions to the plan assets
over the next year are expected to amount to £81k (£81k at 31 December 2017).

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018**

**31.** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)**

**a)** **Defined benefit schemes (continued)**

A quantitative sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions as of 31 December 2018 is as shown below:

**31 December**

**2018**
**£000**
**Interest rate**
Increase 0.5% ........................................................................................................................ (686)
Decrease 0.5% ...................................................................................................................... 785

**Salary trend**
Increase 0.5% ........................................................................................................................ 142
Decrease 0.5% ...................................................................................................................... (131)

**Benefits trend**
Increase 0.5% ........................................................................................................................ 580
Decrease 0.5% ...................................................................................................................... (521)

The sensitivity analyses above were determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined
benefit obligation as a result of realised changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
The sensitivity analyses change key assumptions in isolation. As it is unlikely that changes in assumptions will
occur individually, the results above may not be representative of the actual change in defined benefit obligation.

The following payments are expected contributions to be made in the future years out of the defined benefit plan
obligation:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2018** **2017**
**£000** **£000**

Within the next 12 months ....................................................................... 220 201
Between 1 and 5 years ............................................................................. 931 892
Between 5 and 10 years ........................................................................... 1,416 1,315
More than 10 years .................................................................................. 12,500 11,523

**Total expected payments .......................................................................** **15,067** **13,931**


The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 20 years
(31 December 2017: 20 years).

**b)** **Defined contribution schemes**

The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees of its operations
in the UK. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of
trustees.

The total cost charged to income of £5.2m (2017: £0.8m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by
the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.

As at 31 December 2018, contributions of £549k (31 December 2017: £159k) due in respect of the current
reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.

**GARFUNKELUX HOLDCO 2 S.A.**
**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017**


-----

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GARFUNKELUX HOLDCO 2 S.A.**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

To the sole shareholder of
Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A.
488, route de Longwy
L-1940 Luxembourg

**REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE**

**Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements**

**_Opinion_**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (the
“Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017, and the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a
summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of its consolidated financial performance and its
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of
23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under those Law and
standards are further described in the “Responsibilities of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” for the audit of the
consolidated financial statements” section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with
the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA
Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those
ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.

_Other information_

The Board of directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
stated in the consolidated annual report including the consolidated management report but does not include the
consolidated financial statements and our report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

**_Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the consolidated financial_**
**_statements_**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board
of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.


-----

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GARFUNKELUX HOLDCO 2 S.A.**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

**_Responsibilities of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements_**

The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of “Réviseur
d’Entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the
CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Group’s internal control.

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

  - Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of “Réviseur
d’Entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé”. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

  - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

  - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Corporate information**

The consolidated financial statements of Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (together “The Group”)
for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of Directors on
11 April 2018. Under Luxembourg Law, the consolidated financial statements are approved by the shareholder at
the Annual General Meeting. Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A. (the Company or the parent) is incorporated as an S.A.
(Société Anonyme) and domiciled in Luxembourg. The registered office is located at 488 route de Longwy, in
Luxembourg Ville.

The Group is principally engaged in the provision of credit management services. Information regarding the Group
structure is presented in note 13. Information on other related party transactions is presented in note 32.

**Restatement of prior year presentation**

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These
reclassifications have no effect on the reported loss for the period. An adjustment has been made to the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (“SCI”) for the year ended 31 December 2016 to reclassify
appropriate staff costs as collection activity costs.

**General information and basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair
value. Those standards have been applied consistently to the historical periods. The financial year is the calendar
year.

**Functional and presentation currency**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are prepared in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its “Functional Currency”). For the purposes of these consolidated financial
statements, the results are prepared in Sterling, (the Group’s “Presentational Currency”). All amounts have been
rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.

**Adoption of new and revised standards**

The following accounting standard amendment became effective for periods commencing on or after
1 January 2017 and has been adopted in the current year. This amendment did not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

IAS 7 (amended) Disclosure initiative – the amendments to IAS 7 Statement of cashflows are part of the
IASB’s Disclosure Initiative and require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users
of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities,
including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes.

The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations are in issue and have been endorsed by the EU but
are not yet effective for these consolidated financial statements.

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective from 1 January 2018. The current application of the Effective Interest
Rate with regards to purchased non-performing assets is largely in line with IFRS 9. Business model analysis,
contract review and correlation and causation testing have been undertaken. The current assessment is that IFRS
9 will not have a material financial impact on the Group’s financial statements. This outcome is in line with
management’s expectations given the nature of the Group’s existing portfolio investments is underpinned by
predominantly non-paying accounts. As part of the correlation and causation testing, the following
macroeconomic variables were assessed; unemployment, disposable income, household indebtedness, inflation
and other factors. Additional disclosure requirements, over and above those from IFRS 7, will be required (around
compliance with applicable regulation and the management of risk).

**Adoption of new and revised standards (conintued)**

IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective from 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 establishes a five
step approach to accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard affects revenue from third
party contingent collection services (“3PC”) and other service contracts and contract reviews against the five steps
of the new standard have been completed by the Group. Revenue is earned by the Group through commission
based contracts and fee based contracts. In a commission based contract revenue is based on a % commission of
the payments received from clients and in a fee based contract revenue is based on agreed upon fees. The current
assessment is that IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on any of the Group’s revenue streams.

IFRS 16 – Leases– effective from 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on balance sheet approach to lease
accounting for lessees with optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items. Management
will assess the potential impact of adopting IFRS 16 during 2018.

The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations are in issue but have not yet been endorsed by the
EU and are hence not yet effective for these financial statements.

IFRS 2 – Classifications and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:

  - Power over the investee (i.e. existing voting rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee);

  - Exposure, or rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and

  - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its return.

Generally there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support its presumption and
when the Group has less than a majority of voting rights or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee including:

  - The contractual arrangements with the other investee;

  - Rights arising from the contractual arrangements; and

  - The Group voting rights and potential voting rights.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

**Going concern**

The Group’s business activities are set out in the SCI and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (“SFP”)
on pages F-163 and F-164 respectively. In addition, note 28 to these consolidated financial statements includes
the Group’s financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Cash EBITDA of the Group is an industry accepted measure of a business’s asset base and cashflow
generation. The Group has demonstrated strong performance during the year ended 31 December 2017 with Cash
EBITDA of £299.3m, an increase of £44.8m on the year ended 31 December 2016.

The business as a whole is cash generative before portfolio acquisitions, receiving £481.3m in gross DP cash
collections for the year ended 31 December 2017. The Group continually monitors its cash flow requirements to
ensure that enough cash is available to meet its commitments.

The Group has three main sources of funding at 31 December 2017, €365m, £565m and €415m of listed Senior
Secured loan notes (“notes”), £230m of listed Senior loan notes, and a €200m RCF. There are covenants on the
funding which are detailed in note 18.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Going concern (continued)**

There are long term business plans and short term forecasts in place which are reviewed and updated on a regular
basis by management. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. They consequently adopt the going concern basis of
accounting in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

**Foreign currency**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective Functional Currencies of Group entities at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the Functional Currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling
at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the SCI. Non-monetary assets
and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange
rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are
stated at fair value are retranslated to the Functional Currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair
value was determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
consolidation, are translated to the Group’s Presentational Currency (Sterling) at foreign exchange rates ruling at
the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the
period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange
differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be. When a foreign
operation is disposed of, such that control, joint control or significant influence (as the case may be) is lost, the
entire accumulated amount in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve, net of amounts previously attributed to
non-controlling interests, is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group
disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while still retaining control,
the relevant proportion of the accumulated amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group
disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while still
retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to
profit or loss.

**Business combinations**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for
each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of completion) of assets given, liabilities
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. At
acquisition, non-controlling interest (“NCI”) is measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in
profit or loss as incurred.

Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are
adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below).

All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are
accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRS standards. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration
classified as equity are not recognised.

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition
under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of
deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are
recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits)
respectively.

On a business combination the portfolio investments are recalculated to fair value using an appropriate discount
rate at the date of acquisition, calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date.

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete
information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of
one year from the date of acquisition.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the
acquisition date). Goodwill is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to
benefit from that business combination. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Total goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Additionally, if there is evidence of impairment in any CGU,
goodwill allocated to that CGU is also tested for impairment.

The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs
to sell, and value in use. Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast
cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate discount rate.

If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on
a pro-rated basis in relation to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the goodwill attributable to that subsidiary is included when calculating the profit or
loss on disposal.

**Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method**

_Finance revenue on acquired portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments represents the yield from acquired portfolio investments, net of VAT where
applicable. Acquired portfolio investments are financial instruments that are accounted for using IAS 39
(Financial Instruments), and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The effective interest rate (“EIR”) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts of the acquired
portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition, (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). These
estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the conditions within the markets which the Group operates and
range from 84 months to 120 months.

Acquired portfolio investments are acquired at a deep discount and as a result the estimated future cashflows
reflect the likely credit losses within each portfolio.

Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cashflows be deemed greater than
previous estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period to derive future cash receipts. The difference in
carrying value following an enhanced collection forecast is recognised in the portfolio write up line item within
revenue, with subsequent reversals also recorded in this line. If these reversals exceed cumulative revenue
recognised to date, an impairment is recognised in the SCI.

As part of the acquisition accounting around the purchase of Metis Bidco Limited by Simon Bidco Limited on
13 October 2015 the portfolio investments were uplifted to their fair value at the date of acquisition. The portfolio
fair value release represents the unwinding of this fair value uplift (see note 14). This uplift is being unwound in
line with the profile of gross ERC over an 84 month period, in keeping with a standard collection curve profile in
the UK.

_Service revenue_

Service revenue represents amounts receivable for tracing and debt collecting services (commissions and fees)
provided to third party clients including collection lawyers, net of VAT where applicable. The revenue is
recognised when the service is provided (accruals basis).


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Impairment of acquired portfolio investments**

Acquired portfolio investments are reviewed for indications of impairment at the SFP date in accordance with
IAS 39. Where portfolios exhibit objective evidence of impairment, an adjustment is recorded to the carrying
value of the portfolio investment. If the forecast portfolio collections exceed initial estimates, a portfolio basis
adjustment is recorded as an increase to the carrying value of the portfolio investment and is included in revenue.
If the forecast portfolio collections are lower than previous forecasts the revenue from previous upward
revaluations are reversed and this reversal is recognised in revenue, up to the point that the reversals equal the
previously recognised cumulative revenue. If these reversals exceed the previously recognised cumulative revenue
then an impairment is recognised in the SCI.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Consolidated SFP when the Group becomes
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

_Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss_

This category relates to financial assets and liabilities that must be recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
Such assets or liabilities are initially recognised at cost, which at this point equates to fair value. They must be
measured subsequently at fair value.

The main assets and liabilities in the Group falling into this category are derivative financial instruments that do
not fall under the scope of hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39.

_Loans and receivables_

Acquired portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value. The
portfolios are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the EIR method.

The portfolio investment is analysed between current and non-current in the SFP. The current asset is determined
using the expected cash flows arising in the next twelve months after the SFP date. The residual amount is
classified as non-current.

Portfolio investments include litigation costs which represent upfront fees paid during the litigation process,
expected to be recoverable from the customer and added to the customer account balance to be recovered at a later
date. The release to the SCI is in line with the collection profile.

Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market are classified as ‘Trade and other receivables’. Trade and other receivables are measured at
amortised cost using the EIR method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective
interest rate, except for short-term receivables (including Trade receivables) when the recognition of interest
would be immaterial.

The Group has forward flow agreements in place in relation to the future acquisition of portfolio investments. The
fair value and subsequent amortised cost of portfolios acquired under these agreements are determined on the
same basis as the Group’s other acquired portfolio investments.

_Impairment of financial assets_

Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit or loss / SCI (“FVTPL”), are assessed for
indicators of impairment at each period end. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that,
as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated
future cash flows of the investment have been affected.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Financial instruments (continued)**

_Derecognition of financial assets_

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another
entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues
to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability
for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a
transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised
borrowing for the proceeds received.

_Financial liabilities and equity_

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the
substance of the contractual arrangement.

_Financial liabilities_

All financial liabilities held by the Group are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, except for those
measured at fair value through the SCI, e.g. derivative liabilities. The Group derecognises financial liabilities
when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.

_Derivative financial instruments_

The Group does not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Derivative financial instruments have been used for hedging. As of the balance sheet date, they relate to hedges
taken out to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into, and
subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the
SCI immediately. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value
is negative.

**Fair value measurements**

The fair value of financial instruments is determined in accordance with IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement), as
described in note 28.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event, if it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and if a reliable estimate of the
amount of the obligation can be made.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the SFP date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a
provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the
discounted present value of those cash flows.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third
party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the
amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

**Pensions**

_Defined benefit pensions_

The Group provides defined benefit pension plans through some of its German subsidiaries. Provisions for
pensions are calculated pursuant to IAS 19. Actuarial models are used to calculate the provisions for pensions and
the related pension expenses. These calculations use various assumptions such as current actuarial probabilities
(discount factors, increase in cost of living etc.), assumptions regarding turnover based on age and years of service
as well as experience-based assumptions concerning the probability of occurrence of pension payments, annuity
payments or endowment payments. The probabilities used in the inputs may deviate from actual developments
due to changes in market and economic conditions. Sensitivity analyses are used to determine the financial effects
of the deviations in the significant inputs.

**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Pensions (continued)**

_Defined contribution pensions_

The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for the benefit of its employees. Contributions payable are
charged to the SCI in the period they are payable.

**Leases**

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant
lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic
benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as
an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, the aggregate benefit of incentives is
recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

_Current tax_

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported
in the SCI because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end.

_Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable
profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each SFP date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or
the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the SFP date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the SCI, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Taxation (continued)**

_VAT_

Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of VAT, except:

  - Where the VAT incurred on purchased goods and services cannot be reclaimed from the tax authorities,
in which case the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of the asset or as an expense.

  - Receivables and liabilities are stated with the amount of VAT included.

The VAT amount reclaimable from, or payable to, the tax authorities is reported under receivables or liabilities in
the balance sheet.

**Collection activity costs**

Collection activity costs represents direct staff costs and the direct third party costs in providing services as a debt
collection agency or collecting debts on acquired portfolio investments; examples include printing and postage,
third party commissions, search and trace costs, litigation, telephone and SMS text costs. They are recognised as
the costs are incurred (accruals basis).

**Current versus non-current classification**

The Group presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position based on current/noncurrent classification.

An asset is current when it is:

  - Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;

  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;

  - Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or

  - Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least
twelve months after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

  - It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;

  - It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;

  - It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or

  - There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the
reporting period.

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits with a term from inception of three months
or less, less bank overdrafts where there is a right to offset. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to
the extent that there is no right to offset with cash balances in the same currency.

The Group holds cash on behalf of third parties as part of its collection activities. This restricted cash is shown
within cash with a corresponding liability recognised in other payables.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Share-based Payments**

Some employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based
payments settled by the main shareholder of the Group as described in note 27.

IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires an entity to account for a transaction in which it either:

  - receives goods or services when another entity in the same group (or a shareholder of any group entity)
has the obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction, or

  - has an obligation to settle a share-based payment transaction when another entity in the same group
receives the goods or services

unless the transaction is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the entity
receiving them.

_Equity-settled transactions_

To the extent a cost is recognised, the cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date
when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model.

The cost is recognised in employee benefits expense together with a corresponding increase in equity (other capital
reserves), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the
vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the SCI for a period represents the
movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

In the consolidated financial statements of the Group, the share-based payment arrangements described in note 27
have been classified as equity settled transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with
the employees for services it receives.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Fixtures and fittings 5 years
Hardware 5 years
Office equipment 5 to 15 years
Leasehold improvements Life of lease (0 to 15 years)

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the SCI.

Borrowing costs are added to the costs of an asset provided it is a qualifying asset pursuant to IAS 23.

**Intangible assets**

Separately acquired or internally generated intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and
any recognised impairment loss.

An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal
project) is recognised only if technical feasibility has been demonstrated such that the asset will be available for
use or sale, that there is an intention and ability to use or sell the asset, that it will generate future economic benefit,
and that the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured. Where no internally
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

Software 3 to 5 years Straight line
Licences 1 to 15 years Straight line
Other intangible assets 3 to 10 years Straight line
Trademarks 15 years Straight line
Customer relationships 5 to 10 years Expected life of the underlying contract
(Collection profile)

Development costs are not amortised until the project they relate to is complete and goes live. Once the project is
live the costs are moved from development costs to the relevant category and amortised over the applicable useful
economic life.

Assets are reviewed for signs of impairment at least annually and more frequently if necessary. Impairments are
recognised where the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future economic benefit.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**2.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The reported results of the Group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie
the preparation of the Group’s financial statements. IFRS requires the Directors, in preparing the Group’s financial
statements, to select suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently, and make judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent.

The judgements and estimates used in applying the Group’s accounting policies that are considered by the
Directors to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial position are detailed below. The use of estimates,
assumptions or models that differ from those adopted by the Group would affect its reported results.

**Portfolio investment valuation**

Portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value and are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts of the acquired portfolio investments to the net carrying amount at initial
recognition.

The calculation of the EIR for each portfolio is therefore based on the estimation of future cash flows. The cash
flow forecasts, which represent the undiscounted value of the ERC of our portfolio investments at a given point
in time, are calculated over an 84 month to 120 month period. These estimates are based upon historical collections
data from other portfolios with similar features such as type and quantum of debt, or age. In addition, operational
measures which may impact on future estimated cashflows are built into the ERC. These cash flows are estimates
and are therefore inherently judgemental.

Actual cashflows are regularly compared to estimates to assess the accuracy of previous forecasts.

An uplift or reduction in expected future cash flows of 1% would increase or decrease the closing carrying value
of portfolio investments at 31 December 2017 by £9.6m.

If the forecast portfolio collections exceed initial estimates, an adjustment is recorded as an increase to the carrying
value of the portfolio and is included in revenue as a portfolio write up.

The portfolio investments are reviewed for indications of impairment at the SFP date in accordance with IAS 39
(Financial Instruments). Where portfolios exhibit objective evidence of impairment, an adjustment is recorded to
the carrying value of the portfolio. If the forecast portfolio collections are lower than previous forecasts, the
cumulative revenue recognised is considered as described in the revenue recognition accounting policy.

The adjustment, in relation to either an uplift or impairment, is calculated by discounting regularly revised cash
flow forecasts developed for each individual portfolio investment, at the initially set EIR.

**2.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**Goodwill**

The Group capitalises goodwill on the acquisition of businesses as discussed in the significant accounting policies.
Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of its net assets. The determination
of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those
financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired investment portfolios
where valuations reflect estimates of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the
goodwill arising and to the post acquisition performance of the acquisition.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of
the value in use requires an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU after a suitable discount
rate has been applied to calculate present value. This inherently involves a number of judgements in that cash flow
forecasts are prepared for periods that are beyond the normal requirement of management reporting, and the
appropriate discount rate relevant to the business is an estimate.

See note 10 for further details regarding goodwill.

**Treatment of VAT backpayments**

On 27 October 2011, the European Court of Justice ruled that the purchase of non-performing loans (“NPLs”)
does not constitute a supply of services for consideration by the acquirer to the seller. This judgement was mirrored
by the German Federal Finance Court on 26 January 2012 and in this ruling it was stated that the acquirer could
not reclaim input VAT on the purchase of NPLs. As a result the Group may have to refund the input VAT claimed
for this line of business for the period from 2004 to 2012 to the German tax authorities.

The final letter from the German Federal Ministry of Finance on 2 December 2015 clarified the treatment in
respect of the purchase of NPLs and includes the expected grandfathering rules.

As a result of these rulings, the Group has recognised a provision of £4.8m (31 December 2016: £4.6m) and
corresponding interest of £2.4m (31 December 2016: £2.3m) for VAT in relation to purchases of NPLs in the
years prior to 2012 (see note 20). This provision estimate is determined but will continue to accrue interest until
paid. However the tax authorities have not concluded their review of the historical period and as a result the
amount may change to the benefit or detriment of the Group.

**3.** **SEGMENTAL REPORTING**

**Segmentation**

IFRS 8 requires operating segment reporting to be based on information provided to the chief operating decision
maker which, in this case, is considered to be the Group Executive Committee. Information is presented to the
Group Executive Committee on the basis of the two main regions within which the Group operates – the UK and
DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Croatia). This is in line with the management of the Group. Holding
company costs include amounts recognised in relation to holding companies introduced to the Group on the
acquisitions of GFKL and Lowell.

Both the UK and DACH operating segments derive revenues from the acquisition and collection of consumer
debt portfolios and receivables management.

All revenues are derived from external customers.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that
are expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to
two aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes. The two CGUs identified are the UK, comprising of all subsidiary companies operated in
the UK owned by Simon Bidco Limited, and DACH, consisting of all subsidiary companies operated in DACH
owned by Lowell Holding GmbH.

Euro denominated goodwill is retranslated at each balance sheet date and give rise to the Euro translation effect
shown above.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might
be impaired.

The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and
expected changes to collections and direct costs during the forecast period.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGU’s are
based upon the subsidiary group’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and are as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2017** **2016**
**£000** **£000**

UK CGU ................................................................................................... 6.36% 7.35%

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**10.** **GOODWILL (CONTINUED)**

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent detailed financial budgets approved by
management for the next four years. The forecasts assume growth rates in acquisitions which in turn drive the
forecast collections and cost figures.

The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGU’s carrying value.

**UK CGU**

Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cashflows of 14.1% would result in an impairment at
31 December 2017. An increase in WACC of 4.3 percentage points to 10.7% would result in an impairment at
31 December 2017.

**DACH CGU**

Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast cashflows of 53.6% would result in an impairment at
31 December 2017. An increase in WACC of 3.5 percentage points to 8.3% would result in an impairment at
31 December 2017.

**Senior Secured Notes (“Notes”)**

On 23 July 2015 the Group issued €365m 7.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2022, through its subsidiary
Garfunkelux Holdco 3 S.A. The interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on 1 February and 1 August,
commencing 1 February 2016. The Notes will mature on 1 August 2022, though the Group may redeem the Notes
at an earlier date as per the details set out in the Offering Memorandum issued on 20 July 2015.

On 19 October 2015 the Group issued £565m 8.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2022, through its subsidiary

commencing 1 May 2016. The Notes will mature on 1 November 2022, though the Group may redeem the Notes
at an earlier date as per the details set out in the Offering Memorandum issued on 14 October 2015.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**18.** **BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)**

On 28 September 2016 the Group issued €230m 5.5% plus EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) Senior Secured
Notes due 2021 through its subsidiary Garfunkelux Holdco 3 S.A. The interest on the Notes was payable quarterly
on 1 October, 1 January, 1 April and 1 July, commencing on 1 January 2017.

On 21 April 2017 the Group tapped €175m 5.5% plus EURIBOR (subject a 0% floor) Senior Secured Notes due
2021 through its subsidiary Garfunkelux Holdco 3 S.A. under the indenture dated 28 September 2016 at a price
of 101.25%.

On 20 September 2017 the Group redeemed both the €230m loan notes issued in September 2016 and the €175m
loan notes issued in April 2017, in full at a redemption price of 101% plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

On 20 September 2017 the Group issued €415m 3.5% plus EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) Senior Secured
Notes due 2023 through its subsidiary Garfunkelux Holdco 3 S.A. The interest on the loan notes is payable
quarterly on 1 December, 1 March, 1 June and 1 September, commencing on 1 December 2017. The notes will
mature on 1 September 2023, though the Group may redeem some or all of the notes at an earlier date as per the
details set out in the Offering Memorandum issued on 6 September 2017.

There are two covenant measures under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes; Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
which must be at least 2:1 and Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, which cannot exceed 4.5:1. Both
covenants are incurrence covenants.

The Senior Secured Notes are secured on the assets, share pledges and intra-group receivables of the Group and
are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (EUROMTF).

**Senior Unsecured Notes (“Notes”)**

On 19 October 2015 the Company issued £230m 11.0% Senior Notes due 2023. The interest on the Notes is
payable semi-annually on 1 May and 1 November, commencing 1 May 2016. The Notes will mature on 1
November 2023, though the Group may redeem the Notes at an earlier date as per the details set out in the Offering
Memorandum issued on 14 October 2015. The Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange.

There is one covenant measure under the terms of the Notes, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, which must be at
least 2:1. Again, this is an incurrence covenant only.

**Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”)**

The Group has an RCF commitment of €200m. The RCF has a variable interest rate linked to LIBOR/EURIBOR
and a quarterly commitment fee calculated on the undrawn facility.

Any material company or other member of the Group, which becomes a guarantor of the RCF is required (subject
to agreed security principles) to grant security over certain of its material assets and (if wholly owned by another
member or members of the Group) to have its shares (or equivalent ownership interests) secured in favour of the
Security Agent.

There is one covenant measure under the terms of the RCF additional to the covenant measures under the Senior
Secured Notes as follows: if the aggregate amount of all loan utilisations exceed an amount equal to 30% of the
total commitments, the Group is required to confirm whether or not the Leverage Ratio exceeds 7:1.

No incurrence or maintenance covenants in the Notes and RCF instruments have been breached during the year
to 31 December 2017 or the year to 31 December 2016.

instruments as nominee for the Garfunkelux Group managers and these managers are the beneficial owners of the
shareholder instruments held by Nominee. The Garfunkelux Group managers subscribed for shares in
Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of
grant.

The Garfunkelux Group managers further agreed, in the same agreement, to sell back to Garfunkelux Invest
S.à r.l., the main shareholder of Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., the shares owned in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l.
in the event they cease to be an employee and/or a corporate officer of the Group. The selling price of the shares
is determined on the basis of a number of conditions including the service period and whether the Garfunkelux
Group manager qualifies as good leaver or bad leaver. The sale price of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l.
owned by the Garfunkelux Group managers will be settled in cash.

In the consolidated financial statements of the Group, this arrangement has been classified as equity settled
transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with the Garfunkelux Group managers.
However since amounts paid by the Garfunkelux Group managers for the subscription of the shares in
Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. are at fair value, the awards have no material fair value at grant date and therefore
there is no expense recognised in the SCI for the year or previous year.

  - Operational risk

  - Market risk

  - Conduct risk

  - Interest rate risk

  - Foreign currency risk

  - Capital management risk

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

The Group has no exposure to equity markets and does not hold any speculative equity positions.

**28.** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**Credit risk management**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual payment obligations.

The risk from the concentration of debtor credit risk is limited due to the high number of individual customer
balances and the relatively low value of each of the individual’s debts.

The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios.
All portfolios by their nature are impaired on acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections.
Carrying values are impaired when and if the underlying performance does not meet initial expectations. The
on-going risk is managed through utilising a comprehensive portfolio valuation model and building current
expectations of recoverability from historical information on debt types and customers into pricing assumptions
and models. An investment committee is in place which is attended by members of the Executive Committee as
well as other key members from across areas of the business.

This committee is in place to scrutinise all aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational and regulatory risk
through to the financial assumptions and maximum bid price.

The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements, which are net of
impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

**Liquidity risk management**

Liquidity risk is the risk of the Group being unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, due to
insufficient cash, cash equivalents and available drawings. The approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far
as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by continuously
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. At 31 December 2017, the Group had available undrawn committed
borrowing facilities of €153.8m (31 December 2016: €112.4m). See note 18 for further details on banking
facilities.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Group Executive Committee, which has
established an appropriate liquidity risk management approach for the management of the Group’s short, medium
and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining
adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and
actual cash flows, and by monitoring the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Details of additional
undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are set out below.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**28.** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**Operational risk**

Operational risk is defined by the Group as the potential risk of financial loss, or impairment to reputation, as a
result of internal process failures, or from the inappropriate actions of employees or management. The Board of
Directors has ultimate responsibility for establishing the framework in which operational risk is managed, while
the day to day management of operational risk rests with line managers.

**Market risk**

Market risk is the risk of changes caused by market variables such as prices, type and timing of debt coming to
the market, i.e. the cost of consumer debt portfolios.

In bidding for consumer debt portfolios, the Group seeks to achieve a sufficient yield to cover both the cost of
collection and overhead costs, thereby minimising the risk of not recovering the cost of these portfolios. The
Group uses sophisticated pricing models along with extensive customer and market data to establish the
profitability of portfolios coming to market. The Group monitors its pricing assumptions through Investment
Committees (subsets of the Executive Committee).

The Group manages the unpredictability of the market through a number of financing structures. The Group has
in place €365m, £565m and €415m of Senior Secured loan Notes, £230m of Senior loan Notes, and a €200m RCF
facility. At 31 December 2017 the RCF facility was £41m drawn down (31 December 2016: £75m). This facility
allows the Group the flexibility to bid on portfolios as and when they come to market and are not restricted by
cash flow constraints.

**Conduct risk**

Conduct risk is the risk to customers that the controls and operations of the Group fail. In the UK, a number of
entities are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). If the FCA deemed the Group’s conduct and
customer interaction to be poor or non-compliant it can impose a financial penalty and/or financial redress for
customers. The ultimate penalty would be the withdrawal of that company’s authorisation to provide financial
services. The Directors are not aware of any indication that this is a possibility and seek to minimise the risk
through initiatives such as the Lowell FAIR programme which enshrines the FCA’s six Treating Customers Fairly
principles around fair customer treatment in the Group’s day-to-day activity. Specifically, the FAIR programme
helps shape processes to achieve fair outcomes for customers, assessment of affordability and monitoring and
oversight to minimise conduct risk.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk of changing interest rates. The Group has minimised its risk against changes in interest
rates by being predominantly funded by fixed rate Notes and share capital.

The Group’s RCF has a variable interest rate and at 31 December 2017 this was £41m drawn down
(31 December 2016: £75m). Interest is payable on the RCF at a maximum of 3.5% + LIBOR/EURIBOR. The
Group also had one floating rate note issuance in place at 31 December 2017 with a principal of €415m and an
interest rate of 3.5% + EURIBOR (with a floor of 0%).

**Interest rate sensitivity analysis**

The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments
at the SFP date. A 2.5% per cent increase or decrease represents management’s assessment of the reasonably
possible change in interest rates. If interest rates had been 2.5% per cent higher and all other variables were held
constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 would be c£8.8m lower (2016: c£2.2m lower).
This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.

**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**28.** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**Foreign exchange swap contracts**

The derivatives recognised at 31 December 2017 relate to OTC (“Over the Counter”) foreign exchange derivatives
that the Group concludes with its banking partners. In order to recognise the fair value of these derivatives, the
fair value calculation performed by the Group as of the balance sheet date is used, which is based on the customary
market method and is regularly compared with fair value calculation provided by the counter parties. The fair
value of foreign exchange swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows over the residual term
of the contract based on current market rates and the term structure of interest rates.

**Foreign currency risk**

The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk through its investments in overseas operations which have
functional currencies other than Sterling and foreign currency denominated assets/liabilities and transactions. The
Group minimises its foreign currency risk by having both assets and liabilities in functional currencies other than
Sterling. As the assets and liabilities are matched where practical, the Group monitors and manages its exposure.
The carrying values of the Groups principle foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2017** **2016**
**£000** **£000**

Assets ......................................................................................................... 851,281 848,601
Liabilities ................................................................................................... 1,151,419 938,076

**Foreign Currency Sensitivity**


The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% decrease in Euro against Sterling exchange rates. This
represents the Directors’ assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity
analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated financial instruments and adjusts their
translation at the year end only for a change in foreign currency rates, holding all other variables constant.

**2017** **2016**
**£000** **£000**

Loss before tax ........................................................................................... 7,977 2,647
Shareholders’ equity ................................................................................... 32,540 8,342

**Capital management risk**

The Group’s objective in managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base to support current operations and
planned growth and so to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18 after
deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity (“SoCE”).

The risk management committee reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the
committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**28.** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost (continued)**

For the Group, the fair value of the acquired portfolios is determined using a discounted cashflow model with
unobservable inputs and are classified as level 3 measurements. The Senior and the Senior Secured Notes are
publicly traded instruments whose value can be obtained from public sources; as a result these are classified as
level 1. The remaining financial assets and liabilities carried have a fair value equal to their carrying value.

The fair value of non-financial instruments have been considered and it was determined that the fair value is
materially equal to their carrying value therefore no additional disclosure has been made.

The fair value of the portfolios is calculated by discounting the net forecast cashflows. The unobservable inputs
in determining the fair value are the discount rate and service cost percentage which differ for portfolios that are
not deemed as “paying” at the point of acquisition and those that are deemed as “paying”. A “paying” portfolio is
determined at the point of acquisition based on the proportion of accounts within that portfolio that are set up on
a payment plan. The discount rates have been determined from market information and benchmarking. The service
cost percentage is the percentage used to discount the gross cashflows to net and is based on historical information
on costs to collect.

**Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value**

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows.

  - The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded
on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices (includes listed
redeemable notes, bills of exchange, debentures and perpetual notes).

  - The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are
determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis
using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments. The
acquired portfolio investments fair value is calculated using discounted net 84 month to 120 month
forecast cashflows.

  - The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not
available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration
of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves
derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Foreign exchange swaps are
measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield
curves derived from quoted interest rates.

**Fair value measurements recognised in the Statement of Financial Position**

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial
recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

  - Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities;

  - Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived
from prices); and

  - Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the
asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**31.** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

**a)** **Defined benefit schemes**

The Group has defined benefit pension obligations through its German subsidiary Lowell Financial Services
GmbH. Pension obligations were calculated in accordance with the requirements set out in IAS 19. An interest
rate of between 1.5% and 2.0% (2016: 1.5% and 1.9%), depending on the group of beneficiaries, was used for
this purpose. The defined benefit obligation arising from the defined benefit plans was determined in accordance
with IAS 19. The calculations took into account estimated increases in pensions and salaries as well as an
employee turnover rate. Pension increases were estimated at 1.0% to 1.5% (2016: 1.0 - 1.5%), salary increases at
2.0% (2016: 0.0% to 2.0%), and the employee turnover rate in a range from 0.0% to 2.0% (2016: 0.0% to 2.0%).
The employee turnover rate, in particular, depends on the age of the pension beneficiaries. Mortality and invalidity
rates were measured for the German companies using the 2005 G Heubeck mortality tables.

The pension plan for one of the former members of the Executive Board of Lowell Financial Services GmbH
includes a retirement pension entitlement when the beneficiary reaches the age of 60. This retirement pension is
equivalent to up to 75% of the average fixed salary over the five years immediately prior to retirement. The
pension entitlement for two former employees of GFKL PayProtect GmbH comprises a retirement pension to be
paid when the beneficiary reaches the age of 65. Following the transfer of employees from the ERGO Group,
Sirius Inkasso GmbH recognised provisions for pensions for the first time in 2006. The pension entitlement
comprises a lifelong retirement pension paid when the beneficiary retires from the service of the entity upon
reaching the age of 65. A total of 13 employees at Sirius Inkasso GmbH have the benefit of this pension
entitlement. Pension entitlements have also been granted to employees of Proceed Collection Services GmbH as
a result of the transfer of 19 employees from Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG (now UniCredit Bank AG).

The net liability is calculated as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2017** **2016**
**£000** **£000**

Present value of unfunded defined benefit obligation ................................ 8,419 8,168
Plan assets .................................................................................................. (2,714) (3,027)

**Net liability ...............................................................................................** **5,705** **5,141**


The following table shows the changes in the defined benefit obligation:

**31.** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)**

**a)** **Defined benefit schemes (continued)**

The plan assets offset against the defined benefit obligation are measured at fair value. The change in plan assets
were as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2017** **2016**
**£000** **£000**

**Opening balance of plan assets ...............................................................** **3,027** **2,480**
Net interest income .................................................................................... 50 69
Actuarial gains ........................................................................................... 6 5
Contributions ............................................................................................. 81 78
Payments .................................................................................................... (554) (6)
Currency translation adjustments ............................................................... 104 401

**Closing balance of plan assets .................................................................** **2,714** **3,027**


Since the plan assets have been pledged as collateral, they are netted against the present value of the unfunded
defined benefit obligation. The plan assets are insurance policies entered into by the Group. These assets have
been pledged to the beneficiaries, resulting in a netting requirement under IAS 19. Contributions to the plan assets
over the next year are expected to amount to €91k (€91k at 31 December 2016).

Movements in the period on provision for pensions were as follows:

**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**

**December** **December**

**2017** **2016**

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017**

**31.** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)**

**a)** **Defined benefit schemes (continued)**

A quantitative sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions as of 31 December 2017 is as shown below:

**31 December**

**2017**
**£000**
**Interest rate**
Increase 0.5% ............................................................................................................................. (757)
Decrease 0.5% ........................................................................................................................... 874

**Salary trend**
Increase 0.5% ............................................................................................................................. 162
Decrease 0.5% ........................................................................................................................... (149)

**Benefits trend**
Increase 0.5% ............................................................................................................................. 648
Decrease 0.5% ........................................................................................................................... (579)

The sensitivity analyses above were determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined
benefit obligation as a result of realised changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
The sensitivity analyses change key assumptions in isolation. As it is unlikely that changes in assumptions will
occur individually, the results above may not be representative of the actual change in defined benefit obligation.

The following payments are expected contributions to be made in the future years out of the defined benefit plan
obligation:

**31 December** **31 December**

**2017** **2016**
**£000** **£000**

Within the next 12 months ......................................................................... 201 202
Between 2 and 5 years ............................................................................... 892 853
Between 5 and 10 years ............................................................................. 1,315 1,217
More than 10 years..................................................................................... 11,523 12,047

**Total expected payments .........................................................................** **13,931** **14,319**


The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 20 years
(31 December 2016: 20 years).

**b)** **Defined contribution schemes**

The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees of its operations
in the UK. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of
trustees.

The total cost charged to income of £822k (2016: £651k) represents contributions payable to these schemes by
the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.

As at 31 December 2017, contributions of £159k (31 December 2016: £115k) due in respect of the current
reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.

**32.** **RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)**

**Remuneration of key management personnel**

The remuneration of key management personnel of the Group, who are not Directors of the Company, is set out
below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 (Related Party Disclosures):

**Year ended** **Year ended**
**31 December** **31 December**

**2017** **2016**
**£000** **£000**

Short-term employee benefits .................................................................... **5,198** **4,351**

The above details relate to thirteen key management personnel (2016: twelve) who are Directors and/or senior
executives of subsidiary undertakings of the Company. They are paid emoluments by subsidiary companies
(Simon Bidco Limited, Lowell Financial Limited, Lowell Holding GmbH and Lowell Financial Services GmbH)
for their services to the Group. The Directors of the Company are not paid by any company that forms part of the
Group, see note 5d.


During the year two loans totalling €3.9m have been made to key management personnel. One loan has been made
direct from Lowell Holding GmbH, the other loan has been made from Lowell Holding GmbH to Garfunkelux
Holdco 1 S.à r.l., a related party, and subsequently lent to a member of the key management personnel. Both loans
were made on an arm’s length basis.

**33.** **SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

On 2 February 2018, Garfunkelux Holdco 3 S.A., a direct subsidiary of Garfunkelux Holdco 2 S.A., issued €530m
floating rate senior secured notes at a rate of 4.5% + EURIBOR and SEK1,280m floating rate senior secured notes
at a rate of 4.75% + STIBOR both due on 1 September 2023. This issuance forms part of the financing for the
acquisition of the Carve-out Business from Intrum in the Nordic region.

On 20 March 2018, the Group acquired 100% share in Fair Play Please AS and Lindorff Sverige AB, which
represent the Carve-out Business of Intrum, for €749 million. The acquisition was made through Pofidax Oy, an
indirect subsidiary of the Company.

The Carve-out comprises Lindorff’s entire business in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden as well as Intrum
Justitia’s entire business in Norway and was specified by the European Commission as a condition of the
combination of the two companies in 2017.

Given the short elapsed period between the issue of these financial statements and the date of the acquisition of
the Intrum Carve-out there are no current values for purchase price allocation, this will be undertaken in due
course.
