This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC, and includes any relevant delegated regulations and regulatory technical standards enacted pursuant thereto. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer, the Guarantors or any Initial Purchaser to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors nor any Initial Purchaser has authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the ----- Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive (EU) 2014/65 (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation (a “Qualified Investor”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s (the “Manufacturers”) product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

These non-IFRS measures are defined by us as set out below. We define “3PC income” or “income from 3PC services” as income derived from the provision of third-party collection services. Lawyer service revenue is not included in 3PC income. We define “Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA” as Gross Debt Purchase Collections plus other turnover, less collection activity costs and other expenses (which, together, equals servicing costs) and before exceptional items, depreciation, amortization and impairment of non-performing loans. We define “Cash flow conversion” as cash flow generated by operations before portfolio acquisition costs as a percentage of Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA for the period. We define “Cash flow generated by operations before portfolio acquisition costs” as Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA less working capital movement but excluding portfolio acquisition costs in the period. We define “Group cash income” as Gross Debt Purchase Collections plus income from 3PC services. Group cash income represents our cash collections from owned debt portfolios plus cash commissions received from 3PC portfolios serviced. Lawyer service revenue is not included in Group cash income, as this revenue is generated on a largely pass-through basis, with costs incurred in connection with lawyer service revenue generally slightly exceeding such revenue. We define “Group **_Pro forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA”_** as Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA plus adjustments related to the run-rate effects of completed M&A and run-rate cost savings from restructuring and redundancies. We define “Gross Debt Purchase Collections” as actual amounts collected from owned debt portfolios including put backs and, in the case of our DACH Division, after tax payments for VAT and insurance. Gross Debt Purchase Collections also include consideration received for the sale of our own debt portfolios from time to time, which represents an immaterial share of our Group cash income. We define “net adjusted debt” as third-party debt (excluding accrued interest and subordinated shareholder instruments included under “non-current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash). We define “other turnover” as service revenue, other revenue and other income not classified as exceptional or non-recurring. We define “portfolio acquisition costs” as cash outflow within the period to acquire debt portfolios. We define “portfolio purchases” as the sum of purchase prices of debt portfolios acquired during the period. We define the “purchase price” of a debt portfolio as the value at which it is initially recorded on our or our predecessor’s consolidated balance sheet, as applicable, at the time of purchase. When we acquire a debt portfolio, there may be an interval between the time that the acquisition becomes effective (when we recognize the portfolio on our balance sheet) and the time that payment is made (when we recognize an outflow on our cash flow statement). If the end of a reporting period falls within that interval, the acquisition will contribute to portfolio purchases for one period and portfolio acquisition costs for another period. As a result, our portfolio purchases and portfolio acquisition costs for a given reporting period may slightly differ. We define “working capital adjustments” as the movement in trade and other receivables, movement in trade and other payables, movement in other net assets, unrealized gains / losses from foreign exchange for the period, loss on disposal of subsidiary and loss on disposal of plant, property and equipment and intangible assets in the period. For reconciliations of the Group's net cash generated by / (used in) operating activities to Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA, the Group’s Gross Debt Purchase Collections to Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA, the Group’s ----- operating profit to Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA to Group _Pro forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA, see “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information of the _Group.”_ We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The nonIFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to consolidated profit/(loss) for the year or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and certain of these non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made. Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA as used in this Offering Memorandum is not calculated in the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA” is calculated pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes, as described under “Description of the Notes” or for purposes of any of our other indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Our use or computation of these terms may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of these terms should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS. Our UK Division’s accounting records and non-financial operating data are denominated in pounds sterling whereas our other divisions’ accounting records and non-financial operating data are denominated in euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone. Unless a relevant division’s data had already been reported by the Group in pounds sterling as part of its regular reporting, these data were translated from euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona or Norwegian krone to pounds sterling to facilitate calculation of the pound sterling-denominated combined non-financial operating data that appear in this Offering Memorandum. For other divisions’ data that had already been reported by the Group in pounds sterling, the conversion rates used at the time of translation were the applicable monthly reference rate based on the respective central bank’s foreign exchange reference rates. The key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum are defined as follows: We define “accounts” as the individual non-performing loans and receivables that form a debt portfolio. We consider an account under our owned debt portfolios to be “active” if we expect it to generate further collections. We consider an account to be “inactive” if we do not expect it to generate further collections, such as if the account is settled or closed, or we otherwise determine that we will not be able to collect upon it. Although our owned debt portfolios include both active and inactive accounts, only active accounts as valued are portfolio investments on our consolidated balance sheet. ----- We define “debt portfolio” or “portfolio” as a portfolio of non-performing loans and receivables. We define “Estimated Remaining Collections,” or “ERC,” as the expected future collections projected to be received on all of our owned debt portfolios based on our forecasting models. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our internal models forecast collections over a 120-month period for our UK Division and over a 180-month period for our DACH and Northern European Divisions. In this Offering Memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, all references to ERC with respect to our UK Division refer to ERC over a 120-month period and all references to ERC with respect to our DACH or Northern European Divisions refer to ERC over a 180-month period. We report our UK Division’s ERC over a 120-month period in line with our peers in the UK market, and our DACH and Northern European Divisions’ ERCs over a 180-month period in line with our peers in the European market. Our “120M ERC” is the ERC of our combined Group over a 120-month period and our “Group ERC” is the sum of our UK Division’s 120-month ERC, our DACH Division’s 180-month ERC and our Northern European Division’s 180-month ERC. For more information about how we calculate ERC, including a reconciliation of ERC to the IFRS carrying amount of our owned debt portfolios, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s Financial Condition and Results of _Operations— Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Estimated Remaining Collections (“ERC”).”_ We define the “face value” of an owned debt portfolio as the nominal value of receivables owed in connection with such owned debt portfolio, including any accrued interest, fees and costs applied by the originator at the time of purchase. The face value of an owned debt portfolio may be given as of the time of purchase or as of a subsequent date. “Face value at time of purchase” is the face value of an owned debt portfolio at the time we acquired it, and may include the face value of accounts that have since settled, closed or otherwise become inactive. Face value as of a subsequent date is the face value of accounts that are active as of that date, and excludes the face value of any inactive accounts. We define a division’s “Gross Money Multiple” as the sum of the division’s Gross Debt Purchase Collections since its Start Date and ERC from the division’s owned debt portfolios, divided by the division’s portfolio purchases since its Start Date. We define “owned debt portfolio” as a debt portfolio that we have acquired for settlement, including those that are the subject of our securitization programs. All of our owned debt portfolios are unsecured. We define “Start Date” as (i) June 1, 2004 with respect to our UK Division, (ii) September 30, 2003 with respect to our DACH Division and (iii) January 1, 2003 with respect to our Northern European Division and the combined Group. A division’s Start Date corresponds to when it started acquiring debt portfolios for settlement under the original management and ownership of such divisions or components thereof and, in each case, is earlier than the date on which we acquired the relevant businesses. We define “third-party debt under management” or “3PC debt under management” as the nominal value of debt and receivables that we manage on behalf of third-party clients under our 3PC business. We define “vintage” as the collection of owned debt portfolios acquired in a particular calendar year.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"The Group is one of the largest Credit Management Services (“CMS”) providers in Europe, by revenue and ERC in the debt purchasing business and by third-party debt under management in the third-party collection services business. We believe that the business benefits from scale and diversification in terms of broad geographic reach and balanced revenue mix, together with a complementary and client-focused product offering. Furthermore, our expertise, management and financial resources provide the Group with excellent opportunities to drive further growth and diversification in a highly developed, data-rich credit market. These growth prospects are supported by our clear core competencies: (i) longstanding and multifaceted client relationships built on differentiated strategies for originating new business; (ii) a broad business model that is diversified across product offerings, markets and sectors; (iii) a strong track record of return on capital and reliable portfolio pricing; (iv) strong cash-generation capability featuring high predictability and visibility into future cash flows; and (v) a robust and improving governance framework with a focus on reputation and compliance that we believe is embedded in our operational activity. We provide a range of credit management services across the UK, DACH (collectively, Germany, Austria and Switzerland) and Northern Europe (collectively, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) to a broad client base that includes some of the largest credit providers in Europe. The principal activity of the Group is: the acquisition and collection of non-performing, generally unsecured, consumer debt portfolios (“DP”); and the provision of third party contingent collection (“3PC”) services. 3PC services include debt servicing offerings such as early stage collections, business process outsourcing, contingent collections, trace services and litigation activities. We operate 3PC services primarily in Germany, Austria and Northern Europe. The Group is very well regarded within the industry, a reputation that is further supported by the Group’s key strategic themes of strong customer focus and risk management. Best practices relating to our sophisticated pricing, decision science and cost-optimization experience are continuously shared across our business and make the Group a trusted partner to credit originators and consumers alike. Our Group generated total income of £746.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £657.1 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated operating profit of £150.5 million, Group cash income of £949.6 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of £496.0 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated operating profit of £112.0 million, Group cash income of £930.3 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of £512.7 million (£280.9 million in our UK Division, £101.4 million in our DACH Division and £133.2 million in our Northern European Division, net of £2.7 million of Group costs). As of June 30, 2020, our Gross Money Multiple was 2.6x in the UK Division, 3.2x in the DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division and we had £13.2 billion (as of December 31, 2019: £12.4 billion) of third-party debt under management. We believe that we are a more diversified business than ever before, with a scaled pan-European presence and a range of services on offer that compares favorably to peers. Our ability to provide a full range of services across the CMS value chain helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectable data, which in turn supports the development of tailored collection strategies and analytical capabilities to more accurately price portfolios. Operating with a balanced business model across Europe also enables us to allocate ----- resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the opportunities that are most attractive. Furthermore, the acquisition of the Northern European Division in 2018 has enabled the Group to provide clients with an enhanced range of value-added services before loans and receivables are overdue. These include invoicing, in which the client can outsource its CMS to the Northern European Division, and ability to offer consumers payment through invoice or part payment solutions and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information. These solutions have enabled us to access a wider breadth of credit active customers earlier in the value chain, before the delinquency phase. As the Group continues to develop, we expect to further capitalize on the Group’s strengths by: (i) delivering a multi-product, multi-service and pan-regional offering while maintaining clear pricing discipline; (ii) establishing an industry benchmark for operational excellence through investments in its one-stop service offering; (iii) maintaining a reputation for pioneering insights by continuously improving its IT, data and collection platforms through innovations and investment; (iv) continuing to take a best practices approach to its client relationships and (v) continuing to invest in its employees and corporate culture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our History,9.2.1,,"Since the completion of the Lowell Acquisition in October 2015, our Group, which is controlled by Permira, historically operated through two entities: (i) Metis Bidco Limited and its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries, which operated in the UK and (ii) Lowell Holdco GmbH and its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries, which operated primarily in Germany. As of April 2017, we rebranded the Group as “Lowell” and, following the 2018 Acquisitions, primarily operate at a Group level, with three divisions: our “UK Division,” our “DACH Division” and our “Northern European Division.” As of June 30, 2020, the Group had 3,966 FTEs, with 1,669 in the UK Division, 1,427 in the DACH Division and 870 in the Northern European Division. Our UK Division was established in 2004 and is a leading provider of CMS in the UK, the sole jurisdiction in which it operates. While our UK Division focuses mainly on debt purchase, it performs limited third-party collection services in several sectors and offers certain other CMS activities. Metis Bidco Limited and its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries are now contained within our UK Division following our rebranding in April 2017. Our DACH Division was founded in 1992 and is a leading provider of CMS in Germany. Our DACH Division primarily operates in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Our DACH Division is active across the full value chain of CMS. Lowell Holdco GmbH and its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries are now contained within the DACH Division following our rebranding in April 2017. The Northern European Division is an established player across the Northern European markets with a long track record in each country: Finland (1966), Sweden (1981), Norway (1982) and Denmark (1994). The Northern European Division is active across the full value chain of CMS with strong capabilities across all client sectors. The Northern European Division was formed by the combination of Lindorff’s legacy businesses in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden, as well as Intrum’s legacy business in Norway.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Key Strengths,9.3.1,Leading position across key European consumer credit markets,"The Group is the second largest pan-European credit management company by revenue, Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA and ERC, for the twelve months ended and as of June 30, 2020. Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was £496.0 million and £512.7 million, respectively. We believe the scale of the Group provides several strategic benefits, including bolstering our ability to competitively price portfolios in our debt purchasing activities and develop optimal collection strategies, which we believe will have a positive impact on our revenue and efficiency. Additionally, we believe that the large scale of our business allows us to absorb fixed costs better than our smaller peers, including those related to regulatory and legal, compliance and IT, which should further benefit our margins. Our Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA margin, defined as Group cash income divided by Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA, was 55.1% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, an improvement from the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. ----- We believe the Group’s expanded geographic footprint across our eight core markets, with top-three positions in seven of those markets, combined with top-tier local market positions is a competitive advantage which will further enhance our ability to follow our clients across markets and deepen client relationships. The UK Division, DACH Division and the Northern European Division, our current market-leading and complementary operational divisions, operate primarily in the largest consumer credit markets in Europe, the UK, Germany and Northern Europe. As of December 2019, the UK had approximately £224 billion (according to the Bank of England), Germany had approximately £171 billion and Northern Europe had approximately £158 billion (according to European Central Bank, Swedish Central Bank, Danish Central Bank and Norges Bank) of consumer credit outstanding. In the year ended December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we invested £397.3 million and £351.1 million, respectively, to acquire debt portfolios. As of June 30, 2020, we had £13.2 billion of third-party debt under management (a 1.6% increase compared to June 30, 2019), with LTM placements of over £2.2 billion. In addition, we believe that by focusing on a broad range of sectors, we are able to address a greater portion of all consumer credit volumes generated annually in the UK, DACH and Northern Europe, than we would otherwise be able to address with a less comprehensive approach. We are a market leader and a pioneer in servicing debt originators across multiple sectors. We also have a strong track record of successfully entering new market sectors and gaining high market shares in those sectors, such as the telecommunications, retail and public sectors in the UK, the insurance and fitness sectors in Germany and the financial services sector in Northern Europe. In the UK, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we believe we had a market-leading share of lowbalance debt portfolio purchases in the telecommunications sector and were among the market leaders in the retail sector of the UK debt purchase market. In Germany, we believe we are in the top four CMS by revenue. Across Northern Europe, the Northern European Division purchases debt portfolios across a wide array of industry verticals and holds the number two market position, as defined by debt collection revenue, in Sweden and Finland. It is also ranked amongst the top three in Denmark and amongst the top five in Norway. We believe our scale provides key benefits critical to our success. For example, we are able to develop and maintain a superior operating platform, with highly skilled talent, customized IT systems and sophisticated analytical and data capabilities that drive pricing and debt-collection efficiencies. We believe our scale also enables us to absorb costs associated with legal obligations and regulatory oversight and allows us to provide our clients with a comprehensive service offering capable of addressing their needs throughout the debt recovery cycle. Due to our ability to provide a one-stop service offering, we believe we are able to better maintain and develop relationships with large debt originators than our smaller peers in the UK, DACH and Northern European markets, and as a result, are better positioned than our smaller peers for rapid growth in these respective markets. Furthermore, we believe that the acquisition of the Northern European Division has helped our competitive advantages and fortified our position as a preeminent player in the European CMS sector. The Company has a proven track record of maintaining long-term relationships with clients which include some of the largest credit originators in Europe. We have also historically achieved high levels of repeat purchases from existing customers, which we believe showcases the strong credentials and reputation of our business. Our CMS service line is a market leading platform in DACH and Northern Europe, with a proven track record and longstanding client relationships. Our CMS service line maintains over 300 relationships with average relationship length of approximately eight years.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Key Strengths,9.3.2,Attractive Market Dynamics Supporting Growth and Profitability,"We believe that the characteristics of the core markets in which we operate are conducive to sustainable growth and profitability for the Group. The UK, Germany and Northern Europe have historically benefited from stable macroeconomic conditions, including high levels of per capita GDP, low inflation, low interest rates and low unemployment levels. Despite uncertainty around post-Brexit UK and the COVID-19 outbreak and their respective economic and social ramifications, we believe that our core markets will continue to benefit from supportive structural factors and an improving macroeconomic environment post-COVID-19. In addition, we believe that the legal and regulatory environment in each jurisdiction is strong and stable, which, in our view, fosters market stability. Similarly, we believe that the UK will continue to have a stable legal and regulatory environment as it applies to our business. We also believe that the demanding nature of regulatory compliance in UK, Germany and Northern Europe can be burdensome to small businesses and may therefore increase consolidation opportunities for large players in the CMS. ----- Moreover, the markets in which we operate comprise a diverse range of sectors in which consumer debt is originated (e.g., the financial services, insurance, retail, telecommunications, public and utilities sectors, among others). We believe we are able to develop business in this broad range of sectors, in part, because CMS companies such as ours can provide certain benefits to debt originators across sectors, including consumer insights and cost reductions due to reduced administrative and labor costs, improved collection rates and a more professional approach to debt collection. Further, debt originators’ outsourcing of the debt collection process yields the additional benefit for the debt originator of reducing management time devoted to what is typically a non-core activity, while also providing additional consistency in debt handling with a more robustly documented audit trail. With respect to size and growth of consumer credit markets in our geographies, we believe that the market in the UK has several distinctive features that make it attractive to CMS companies like us. We believe that the UK is the largest consumer credit market in Europe, with an estimated £224 billion of outstanding debt as of December 2019, according to the Bank of England. In addition, we believe that the UK has one of the largest NPL markets in Europe by face value of defaulted debt sold annually. We believe that the UK consumer NPL market is consolidating around a small number of sophisticated and large-scale players, such as our UK business, which we believe is competitively advantaged to grow more quickly, and at higher levels of profitability, than its smaller peers. We believe such players have a number of structural advantages, including, for example, an ability to exploit more extensive consumer databases, a heightened capacity to absorb the burdens of an increasingly demanding compliance environment and an ability to more readily develop a comprehensive service offering for their clients. Moreover, management has observed a growing propensity on the part of UK debt originators to sell debt portfolios earlier in the recovery process, and we believe that their demand for other CMS services is likely to increase, not just in response to COVID-19-related stress but throughout the credit cycle. Similarly, the consumer credit market in Germany is also distinguished by several features that, in our view, make it attractive to CMS companies. We believe that Germany is the second largest consumer credit market in Europe, with an estimated £171 billion of outstanding debt as of December 2019, according to the European Central Bank. In addition, Germany boasts a large stock of overall defaulted debt and is also one of the largest consumer NPL markets in Europe by flow of newly created unsecured consumer defaulted debt. A diverse range of German businesses, from sectors such as financial services, fitness, retail and telecommunications, originate consumer credit from a diverse consumer base. These businesses use a varied set of collection methods to support the debt recovery process and typically outsource the majority of their receivables collections. Moreover, management has observed demand among German debt originators for BPO services and a willingness on the part of German debt originators to outsource collection in the early stages of the recovery process (for example, by as early as 45 days after the original payment due date). Since the German CMS market is highly fragmented, with approximately 600 to 900 players, we believe that large players, such as the Group, have a competitive advantage due to the scale and the breadth of their client relationships, which helps them originate new debt purchases and 3PC agreements. In addition, we believe that Germany has both a strong repayment culture and creditor-friendly laws and regulations, and that together, these features create a favorable environment for debt collection. Creditors in Germany benefit from a long enforcement period against consumers, since the statutory limitation period in Germany for applying for and obtaining an enforcement title against consumers is generally three years and, once obtained, the enforcement title is valid for 30 years. Further, under German law, creditors are generally entitled to charge additional amounts to the consumer as damage caused by delayed payment, including default interest, the costs of third-party collection services and legal costs. Each of these factors has, in our view, helped to drive up the profitability of debt collection in Germany. The consumer credit market in Northern Europe is also a large and mature market with a stable regulatory regime. The credit management industry in Northern European countries has existed for more than 100 years, and matured significantly following the financial crisis in the 1990s, when debt collection companies, including the Northern European Division, grew their businesses and supported clients in their deleveraging of large, overdue debt portfolios. In 3PC services, clients have historically preferred well-known and established players. This has benefited the Northern European Division with its leading pan-Northern European platform. According to a market study by a leading consultancy firm in September 2017, the proportion of debt portfolio sales compared to 3PC serviced portfolios is expected to increase from their current level of approximately 40% of the overall NPL market, as clients, particularly financial institutions, show an increasing willingness to optimize their balance sheet. The Northern European Division is, thus, also well placed to take advantage of this trend owing to significant operational synergies among its business segments as its debt collection segment serves as an origination source for debt purchasing. Based on data from the European Banking Authority (“EBA”), European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately £0.5 trillion as of December 31, 2019, representing more than 1.2 times 2007 levels. We believe that European bank NPL stock could increase to as much as £1.2 trillion, based on a peak European NPL ratio of ----- 6.8% reached in Q4 2013 and outstanding loans and advances of £18.0 trillion as of December 31, 2019. We expect continued regular and proactive sales by banks as they manage a broad range of new rules and regulations, such as Basel IV, IFRS 9 and ECB calendar provisioning. As a result, we anticipate an increase in debt sales as a proportion of NPL stock. Moreover, we believe that non-traditional, digital lenders that have experienced rapid loan book growth in recent years do not have in-house collection expertise and are likely to engage CMS players to service their portfolios.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Key Strengths,9.3.3,A Balanced Business Model with Significant Diversification Benefits,"The Group operates a balanced and diversified business model. Our debt purchase business and 3PC services business generated 82% and 18% of Group cash income, respectively, for each of the year ended December 31, 2019 and 83% and 17%, respectively, the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our Group earned revenue from over 4,000 portfolios for our debt purchasing business and from over 300 different clients for our third-party collection services. In addition, we believe we have the most diversified industry mix among our peers. Our client base encompasses clients in the financial services, insurance, retail, telecommunications, fitness, public and utilities sectors, among others. As of June 30, 2020, our 120M ERC split by industry was financial services (58%), retail (22%), telecommunications (15%), and other (5%). For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Group’s portfolio purchases split by industry was financial services (61%), retail (17%), telecommunications (13%) and other (10%). The Group is able to provide these clients with a one-stop service offering that includes third-party collection services, risk management and value-added services. We believe this one-stop service offering helps us both to build strategic partnerships and to embed ourselves further in our clients’ credit-management processes. For example, management has observed that our provision of third-party debt collection services can lead to debt purchases and help improve our debt portfolio modelling. In addition to diversification, we believe our pan-European presence allows us to realize a number of key benefits that we believe provides us with key competitive advantages. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the UK Division, DACH Division and Northern European Division contributed 47.7%, 27.4% and 24.9%, respectively, to Group cash income. We believe the combination of allocating capital at a group level into markets where we believe our risk/reward return is the most attractive and the expertise of the individual businesses allows us to allocate capital and originate business across markets, sectors and clients to wherever we see the greatest opportunities. We believe that this increased flexibility enhances our adaptability and resilience in changing market trends and economic cycles. Moreover, since we have a higher volume of accounts, spread across a more diverse array of sectors and debt originators, we believe we are advantaged in our pricing accuracy and our ability to enhance the efficiency of our collection processes. Our broad-based business model has been enhanced by the acquisition of the Northern European Division, which is active across the entire CMS value chain in Northern Europe. In addition to 3PC services and debt purchasing, the Northern European Division provides a wide range of value-added services before debt and receivables are overdue, including consumer and credit information and analysis, selection and scoring of potential consumers, invoicing and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information. The Northern European Division has reinforced our flexibility and balanced product offering, which we believe positions us well to maximize revenue by offering solutions to clients along the entire CMS value chain, enabling us to operate as a “one-stop shop” for our clients. While our predominant activities continue to remain debt collection and debt purchasing, the value-added services segment has become an important source of origination for the debt purchasing and debt collection businesses and for data collection.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Key Strengths,9.3.4,A Consumer-Centric Approach at the Core of our Business,"Our collection rate is dependent on our ability to both understand consumers and to treat them fairly and with respect. We believe that by treating our consumers in this manner, and by ensuring regulatory compliance and maintaining a strong risk management discipline within our Group, we are able to maintain and foster a positive reputation. We believe that having a positive reputation is a key factor to our success as a debt servicing company. Our UK Division has received numerous accolades for its strong track record with respect to the quality of its customer service. Our UK Division has received a number of awards from Investors in Customers (“IIC”), a UK customer-experience consultancy, including a “Gold Award” in 2017 (previous “star” ratings have been replaced with bronze, silver and gold awards and we were the first company to receive the Gold Award), a “Gold ----- for Investors in Customers” in 2018, “Debt Purchase Provider of the Year” in 2019 and “Best Use of Technology” for our roll out of Robotic Process Automation in 2019. Our UK Division also benefits from a Trustpilot (a consumer review website) rating of 4.4/5 stars. Our DACH Division has also been recognized for its consumer service. According to a 2018 report, we held the highest S&P Servicer Rating level for German CMS providers. Our Northern European Division has also been recognized for its commitment to consumer service, and in 2019, Lowell Norway won “The CX Mover: Best implementation – Time to achieve value” at the world’s largest conference for contact centers and customer experiences in Denver, Colorado, USA. These achievements are a product of our focus on risk management. Our risk management framework is grounded in our management structure, our processes and a “three lines of defense” risk-management (see “Our _Group’s Business—Compliance and Risk Management” for a description of the “three lines of defense” model)_ that we believe mirrors the highest risk-management standards in the CMS industry. Compliance is at the heart of our Group’s operations. We believe that we have a strong track record with respect to consumer complaints in all the geographies we operate in. For example, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the FOS-filed complaint ratio in our UK Division was 11.9 cases filed per one million active financial services accounts. In our DACH Division, we received, on average, 0.01% consumer complaints as a percentage of active accounts for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. In our Northern European Division, we received, on average, 0.003% consumer complaints as a percentage of active accounts for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. A focus on risk management and compliance are woven into our Group’s structure from the local level to the internal and independent external risk control and auditing functions carried out at the executive and board levels. We believe the decision science that underlies our Group’s collection techniques contributes to our ability to manage compliance and reputational risk. We further believe that our focus on and extensive experience in compliance and risk management resonate well with debt originators and provide us with a competitive advantage in the UK, DACH and Northern European regulatory environments, which, though different in their particular legal frameworks and regulations, are similarly designed, robust and stable. It is our view that the well-developed nature of such environments provides us with a competitive advantage and favors strong market participants, such as our Group, which has the scale and experience necessary to meet demanding compliance requirements. Our Group has an overarching commitment to be a fair and principled business that puts people at the heart of the culture, particularly our consumers. This shared values-based approach is central to our integration and provide consistency to our vision of being the best in our field.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Key Strengths,9.3.5,Competitive Advantage Embedded in Sophisticated Data Analytics,"The Group has invested, and continues to invest, in what we believe to be industry-leading IT and data platforms in our markets. Through our consumer data, which we believe to also be industry-leading, we have developed proprietary behavioral and asset valuation models, custom software applications and a variety of other business tools. The Group’s systems are technologically sophisticated, highly automated and driven by data derived from databases of owned and serviced debt portfolios in the markets in which we operate, and we believe that our Group has the largest databases in the UK and DACH and one of the largest datasets in Northern Europe. State of the art data science techniques serve as an integral part in the process of pricing portfolios ahead of acquisitions and allow the business to establish more efficient debt, consumer and customer engagement strategies. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s systems held data derived from some 4,281 owned debt portfolios, of which there were 22.2 million active accounts. We believe that our data systems benefit from a virtuous circle that further strengthens our informational advantage relative to that of our competitors. In our experience, the more debt portfolios we service or purchase, the more data and collection experience we derive and the more accurate our tracing and pricing systems become. We also believe that our systems’ increasing sophistication has the additional benefit of making them increasingly difficult to replicate. Thus, given the breadth of our experience throughout the credit management value chain, we have access to comprehensive databases of purchased and serviced debt. Our IT and data platforms are subject to an ongoing process of improvement and innovation, which we support with ongoing investment. We believe that our sophisticated and scalable IT and data platforms, in which we have made robust investments, provide significant competitive advantages. Combined with our decision science capabilities, we are able to take a centralized approach to forecasting and pricing that is supported by specialist local input, ensuring strong cross-organizational evaluation of portfolio pricing. In our experience, our automated pricing models and tracing systems have helped to increase the accuracy with which we price both owned debt portfolios and third-party collection service ----- contracts, thereby increasing our chance to win a bid at the right price while reducing our downside risk on the owned debt portfolio or signed contract. The Group’s data capabilities combined with lean operational processes also facilitate more efficient and effective debt collection strategies through robotics, data science and cross-learning. In addition, the risk management approach of the Group helps to ensure that the sophisticated pricing information is used in an investment decision-making context that focuses on compliance and maintaining strong internal controls. We believe that our sophisticated collection strategies and approach to a digital enabled business, in turn, lead to increased collection efficiency and reduced collection costs. Further, we believe our sophisticated IT and data platforms allows us to compete effectively in sectors in which our peers struggle to generate sufficient returns, in particular in low-balance sectors such as retail, telecommunications and utilities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Key Strengths,9.3.6,Strong Track Record of Return on Capital and Portfolio Pricing Through the Cycle,"We believe that we have a track record of strong and stable return on capital supported by continuous improvement in decision science and the use of feedback from our collection operations. The Group’s aggregate Gross Money Multiple on portfolios purchased as of June 30, 2020 was 2.6x in our UK Division, 3.2x in our DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division. Moreover, since Group management is involved in investment decisions at each division, we believe that we are able to deploy our capital across the UK, DACH and Northern European regions to wherever returns are most promising, which we believe contributes to our ability to maintain high returns on capital. We believe that continuous improvement in decision science and leveraging feedback from collection operations have helped strengthen our underwriting, resulting in a narrower disparity between forecasted and actual returns. Our historical actual collections compared to forecast collections demonstrate our accurate and disciplined yet prudent forecasting. We have steadily met or exceeded our forecasted collections, even during more challenging economic environments. For example, following the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis, our UK predecessor company’s actual collections exceeded forecasts, with actual collections on the December 31, 2008 static pool reaching 104% of forecasted collections by June 2020. Our Group’s actual Gross Debt Purchase Collections on portfolios owned by the Group as of December 31 of the prior year (the “static pool”) were 103% of our forecasted collections for the year ended December 31, 2018, 104% of our forecasted collections for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 94% of our forecasted collections for the six months ended June 30, 2020, and we have met or outperformed our forecasted collections on the static pool each year between 2007 and 2019. We believe that our disciplined approach to portfolio pricing has helped us avoid overbidding on debt portfolios. Our portfolio pricing process begins with a rigorous and extensive due diligence and valuation exercise, which may involve, among other things, building a synthetic debt portfolio with actual performance data and similar consumer characteristics and performing on-site file testing to assess the underlying quality of the debt portfolio before submitting our final bid. Our due diligence and valuation methods benefit from the market-leading scale of our data, our sophisticated and automated data systems and our experienced and skilled portfolio pricing specialists. Our ability to leverage our own data and our specific expertise and databases from comparable portfolios across many sectors minimizes risk and helps to ensure accurate pricing bolstered by strong in-house analytical capabilities. Upon the successful completion of due diligence, a debt portfolio is subject to a clear and systematic internal review and approval process culminating in a decision to either approve or reject the proposed portfolio investment. Our disciplined capital deployment and selectivity with respect to portfolio purchases has helped us achieve an IRR with respect to our portfolio purchases of 19% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 16% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Key Strengths,9.3.7,High Visibility into Future Cash Flow Generation,"Our debt portfolio purchase business provides excellent visibility into future earnings, as well as substantial cash-flow generation backed by a significant asset base. Although the Group’s ERC metrics extend for up to 180 months, depending on the division, a majority of collections occur within the first 48 months. As of June 30, 2020, we expected approximately 34% of our 120M ERC to be collected within the next 24 months and approximately 58% to be collected within the 48-month period. As of June 30, 2020, the Group had 4,281 owned debt portfolios and 120M ERC was £3,466.1 million, resulting in an aggregate Gross Money Multiple on portfolios purchased of 2.6x for our UK Division, 3.2x for our DACH Division and 2.5x for the Northern European Division. We believe we take a cautious approach to repayment by attempting to establish recurring payment methods with lower rates of default, such as direct debits and continuous payment authorizations on debit and credit cards. ----- In addition, we believe that the multi-year nature of our forward flow agreements helps to provide us with visibility into new business origination and expected returns. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 55% of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases came from forward flow agreements. Similarly, forward flow agreements accounted for 55% and 67% of portfolio purchases in the DACH Division and Northern European Division respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. In addition, we made £351.1 million of portfolio purchases for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and believe that our significant asset base of owned debt portfolios is capable of continuing to yield predictable cash flows. We believe that our ERC forecast is reliable and resilient, as a significant portion of the payments on our portfolios are made through long-term payment plans. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 long term payment plans as a percentage of collections was 80% in the UK Division, 40% in the DACH Division and 24% in the Northern European Division. Our third-party collection services business is also cash generative and typically enables us to scale our business without requiring significant incremental investments. We believe that the contractual arrangements in the third-party collection services business, which are both stable and of increasing durations (notably for contracts with large, well-known clients), provide visibility into future collections, the fees we derive from them as well as associated cash-flow generation. Our income from 3PC services was £169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £158.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019 income from 3PC services represented 17.8% of Group cash income and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 income from 3PC services represented 17.1% of Group cash income. Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA was £496.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £512.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, and 120M ERC was £3,466.1 million as of June 30, 2020. Our Group cash income, gross profit, and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA each increased between the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020.

We intend to focus on providing a fair, understanding and consumer centric approach to our debt collection services. To that end, we intend to work with each consumer to develop a payment plan that is realistic, sustainable through economic cycles and tailor-made to the consumer’s circumstances, allowing the consumer to restore his or her financial standing and continue to access mainstream ----- credit products. To maintain and enhance this individualized approach to our consumers, we intend to continue to leverage our decision science capabilities in order to help ensure that the consumer profiles we build are as accurate and up-to-date as possible. We aim to communicate closely, clearly and transparently with the consumer and strive to understand their situation and circumstances. We believe that clear communication will enable us to have visibility with regard to the timing and profile of future collections. As the legal and regulatory environments in which we operate continue to evolve, we intend to adapt our culture, practices and policies appropriately, while always seeking to be the model that others look to for compliance standards and best practices. Compliance is an increasingly important differentiating factor in our industry and in the markets in which we operate. We believe that our focus on compliance reassures our clients that their customers and reputations are in safe hands, and thus will give us a key competitive advantage going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategy,9.4.2,Establish an Industry Benchmark for Operational Excellence Through a Diversified One-Stop Offering,"We believe that debt originators are increasingly seeking a holistic, cost-efficient approach to CMS that fully complies with applicable regulations. To address this growing need, we aim to continue to develop our onestop service offering, a differentiated services offering that addresses each step of the debt recovery cycle and thereby helps us to further embed our operations within those of our clients. We also intend to further diversify our one-stop service offering by capitalizing on the Northern European Division’s value-added services offering. Moreover, we have a strong track record of opening new sectors to the CMS market, such as entering into the telecommunications and utilities market in the UK, and we seek to continue to build relationships with entities that have not previously sold debt portfolios or purchased CMS services. Our geographic diversity has positioned us to fully leverage our geographic footprint by launching products which have been successful in one market into our other markets. Our longstanding client relationships and high volumes of data in our UK, DACH and Northern European markets, along with our meaningful presence throughout our other markets, contribute to our ability to anticipate our clients’ changing needs while identifying new market opportunities. The Group’s strategy will be focused on increasing its current share of the CMS markets in the UK, DACH and the Northern European regions by continuing to work closely with the main debt originators in each of our key sectors. We have adopted a proactive approach to managing our relationships with debt originators, with an emphasis on transparency and building longstanding professional relationships based on a granular understanding of a debt originator’s business and CMS requirements. This local, specialized approach to our client relationships allows us to provide specialized offerings that have been tailored to reflect the consumer’s individual needs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

We aim to extend our strong track record of implementing incremental technological and collection process improvements, which have contributed to enhanced performance and increased efficiency throughout our business. For example, in the UK we are actively deploying technology through which we are able to more closely tailor our contact to the consumer’s unique circumstances. In addition, on a Group-wide basis we are implementing a multi-channel digital strategy to better connect with our consumers. We believe these initiatives will improve the efficiency of our operations platform through cost reductions, increased collections or a combination of these two effects. Sophisticated data analytics underpin our disciplined approach to pricing and investment decisions, which we believe are an integral part of our strategy and which differentiate us from our competition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategy,9.4.4,Develop Sustainable Competitive Advantage in Chosen Markets to Facilitate Continued Growth,"Our strategy is to ultimately become the leading multi-product and multi-service provider of CMS services in our chosen markets. We believe that we have a complementary set of competitive advantages across the UK, DACH and Northern European regions that are essential to helping us achieve this objective. Our UK Division is a leader in the UK CMS market and possesses one of the most sophisticated debt purchase platforms in Europe. Our DACH Division is a leading player in the DACH debt purchase and third-party collection services markets and provides our clients with a diversified service offering that harnesses our expertise in a range of CMS services, including BPO and risk-management services. Our Northern European Division also has a leading position in the Northern European CMS market, including BPO and risk-management services in the Northern ----- European financial institutions client segment that possesses one of the most sophisticated debt purchasing and collection platforms in the data-rich Northern European region. By sharing best practices within the Group and utilizing our complementary competencies in debt purchasing and outsourced credit services, we believe the strength of each of our divisions enables us to seize new opportunities to help us expand our offering both geographically and throughout several key market sectors. Our pricing discipline and systematic, objective pricing processes remain an integral part of our strategy and lay the foundation for us to build a sustainable competitive advantage. We believe that as a result of our pricing discipline, among other factors, we have been able to grow our asset base and profits, notwithstanding the changing economic environment, and have maintained stable, strong and predictable overall returns on capital across our sectors. We plan to continue to invest in our pricing methodologies and capitalize on the virtuous circle by which the consumer profiles and collections data we gather each month continuously add to the accuracy and sophistication of our systems and models. Moreover, since we make investment decisions at the Group level, we believe we will be able to deploy our capital across the Group to wherever returns are most promising, which we believe will contribute to our ability to maintain high returns on capital.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

We search for people with enthusiasm, passion and commitment and when we find them, we invest in them heavily in order to deliver on our promises of connection, communication, development, involvement, recognition and reward. They create the culture that defines our business, protects our reputation and drives our performance, and they constitute the primary component of our consumers’ experience. We strive to build a unique corporate culture in which our people are imbued with a sense of engagement and belonging.

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategy,9.4.6,Enter into Strategic Partnerships with Reputable Investors and Financial Institutions,"In our debt purchasing segment, we see a pipeline in terms of the number and the size of investment opportunities available, which is outpacing our on-balance sheet investment capacity. In such a scenario, coinvestment structures are opportunities for the Group to gain access to larger portfolios and build scale through our ability to source, price and service unsecured consumer finance portfolios. We believe this will contribute to an increase of the revenue from third-party servicing and help to better manage the Group’s financial profile by adjusting exposure and overall allocation. In order to partner with well-established co-investors, the investors must be confident that we are able to service the portfolio in an efficient and professional manner without any conflict of interest or principal-agent problems. We believe the ability to transact with established investors creates a unique advantage for the Group: - Expand purchasing capacity – ability to participate in larger deals across our markets with less capital intensity; - Higher returns – opportunity to leverage servicing platforms (acting as servicer of portfolios) and gain scale; and - Lower risk – ability to manage the risk versus return by adjusting own exposure depending on market WACC and desired overall allocation, regardless of transaction sizes. In January 2020, we entered into an NPL purchase agreement with German private bank Oldenburgische Landesbank (OLB). Under the terms of the arrangement, we will procure NPLs in the DACH region for OLB, up to an amount of €30 million per year. We will carry out debt collections and servicing on all debt portfolios through a master servicing agreement, which will provide a new stream of future servicing income. Also in January 2020, we entered into a co-investment partnership with a listed global asset manager with Assets under Management and Administration (AuMA) of over £300 billion as of June 30, 2020. Under this partnership, the global asset manager and the Group will acquire 90% and 10% interests, respectively, in nonperforming loan portfolios across the Group’s markets with targeted deployments of €300 million over a three year period. The Group will carry out debt collections/servicing on all acquired portfolios through a master servicing agreement providing a new stream of future servicing income. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategy,9.4.7,Strong Focus on Leverage and Funding Diversification,"Prudent capital management is at the center of our financial policy. We organically reduced the Group’s consolidated total net leverage ratio to 4.7x as of June 30, 2020, a decrease of 0.4x since June 30, 2019, on the back of better front book returns and overall margin improvement driven by strong cost control and slower overall spend. The consummation of the Transactions is expected to further reduce overall leverage of the Group as of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, to a consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.6x. Due to our decision to temporarily pause new litigation activity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect our Gross Debt Purchase Collections in 2020 to fall short of previous estimates and, notwithstanding COVID-19 related cost reduction measures, we expect Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA to slightly decline in the year ending December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and, as a consequence, total net leverage to increase slightly during this period. See _“—Recent Developments—COVID-19.” However, we expect the reduction in overall leverage to continue as we_ remain committed to our publicly stated leverage guidance of a consolidated total net leverage ratio in the range of 4.0x to 3.5x by 2021-2022. Our deleveraging targets assume resumption of UK litigation activity from H2 2020 onwards and no further forbearance measures (either voluntary or government-imposed) in any of our regions. While we believe our stated leverage guidance to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information and this information may not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of the financial year or any future period. See “Forward-Looking Statements.” In addition, the Group is actively exploring alternative ways to fund growth. Recent examples include our focus on growing our relatively less capital intense servicing segment and pursuing co-investment structure opportunities, including our recent co-investment partnership with a listed global asset manager, which has targeted deployments of €300 million to purchase non-performing loan portfolios over the next three years, as well as a partnership with a bank managing over €20 billion in assets to carry out debt collections and servicing on all owned debt portfolios. See “—Our Strategy—Enter into Strategic Partnerships with Reputable Investors _and Financial Institutions.”_ As our pipeline of potential investment opportunities continues to outpace our on-balance sheet investment capacity, co-investment structures present opportunities for the Group to access larger portfolios and build scale by capitalizing on our ability to source, price and service unsecured consumer finance portfolios. We expect this to drive increasing income from third-party servicing and to help better manage the Group’s financial profile by improving the composition of our portfolio exposures and allocations. The ability to transact with established investors presents a unique opportunity for the Group to (i) expand our purchasing capacity and our ability to participate in larger deals across geographies with less capital intensity, (ii) generate higher returns and create further opportunities to leverage our servicing platforms and gain scale and (iii) improve our risk/return management and profile by adjusting our exposures depending on market WACC and desired allocation mix regardless of transaction sizes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategy,9.4.8,Participate Opportunistically in Consolidation of our Industry when Accretive Opportunities Exist,"We have a strong track record of selective and accretive expansion in the UK and Germany, as demonstrated by our acquisition of IS Inkasso Service in May 2016, the Tesch Group in September 2016 and Apontas in October 2016 and the Northern European Division from Intrum in April 2018 and Lucas Credit Services in July 2019. Furthermore, the Group has a proven track record of successfully expanding by acquiring carve-outs of the internal collections businesses of banks, insurers, telecoms and utility companies. In July 2020, we announced the acquisition of Solvencia AS, which we believe will establish us as a leading 3PC player in Norway, strengthen our 3PC business in Sweden and Finland and build up our Northern European Division’s capability to collect small balance debts in Norway. The acquisition closed on October 1, 2020. As our business continues to develop, we intend to continue to participate opportunistically in the consolidation of the European CMS industry in order to build scale, address untapped consumer segments and create new relationships with debt originators. We intend to strategically pursue further carve-out transactions with current clients and credit-accretive bolt-on acquisitions. We will continue to apply our strong and disciplined approach to valuation in connection with these potential acquisitions. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Recent Developments,9.5.1,COVID-19,"In response to the spread of COVID-19, we promptly undertook a number of temporary initiatives to safeguard our employees and ensure business continuity. We transitioned the vast majority our workforce to remote working by early April 2020, and expect that a significant proportion of our workforce will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future. We proactively engage with our clients to maintain strong and mutually beneficial relationships and are committed to working with our consumers to achieve affordable and sustainable repayments and continue to focus on vulnerability checks. In response to the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and possible related effects on our consumers, we took the decision to temporarily reduce our outbound consumer contact activity and paused new legal collections activity in our UK Division. We continue to benefit from scale and diversification, with our broad geographic reach and balanced revenue mix between debt purchase and 3PC. We believe we operate leading platforms in mature Northern and Western European markets where we hold significant data assets and deep client relationships, focusing on our core competence of unsecured consumer debt, and managing approximately 22.2 million active accounts across more than 4,281 owned debt portfolios as of June 30, 2020. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We are continuing to monitor developments relating to COVID-19 and are coordinating our operational responses based on existing business continuity plans and guidance from global health organizations and relevant governments.

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Recent Developments,9.5.2,Trading Update,"Our fundamentals and business model have proven resilient to date, and we remain optimistic about opportunities for the medium and long term. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not finalized trading results for the three months ended September 30, 2020. However, based on preliminary financial information, we estimate that, for the three months ended September 30, 2020, our Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA was approximately £139 million an increase of approximately 6% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, and our Group cash income was approximately £228 million, a decrease of approximately 7% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, our available liquidity was £303.0 million (including cash and cash equivalents and available drawings under our other financing arrangements), compared to £285 million of available liquidity (including cash, cash equivalents, available drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility and available drawings under our other financing arrangements) as of September 30, 2019. In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our purchases of debt portfolios (measured as the amount of cash payments made in such period) was £180 million, a decrease of approximately 35% compared to the prior year nine-month period. Gross Debt Purchase Collections have shown good resilience since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, since April 2020, we experienced a reduction in total Gross Debt Purchase Collections when compared with our forecast Gross Debt Purchase Collections expectations on portfolios owned by the Group as of December 31, 2019 (the “static pool”). For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our Gross Debt Purchase Collections on the static pool amounted to approximately 93% of our forecast. This reduction has largely been driven by the impact on our UK Division of management decisions taken to temporarily reduce outbound consumer contact activity and pause new legal collections. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, collections for our UK Division were at 83%, 84% and 86% of forecasted expectations against the static pool in July, August and September respectively, trailing our DACH and Northern European Divisions. We believe that approximately 90% of this shortfall was due to conscious measures on the part of our management. Since June 2020, our UK Division has increased outbound consumer contact activity and since August 2020 has resumed new legal collections, with the intention of increasing the division’s future Gross Debt Purchase Collections, which increased to 86% of forecast expectations in September 2020. ----- For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our UK Division’s Gross Debt Purchase Collections on accounts with a payment plan in place as of December 31, 2019 (the “paying base”) performed at 96% of our forecast for paying-base accounts. As of September 30, 2020, we have not experienced a material change in the percentage of collections coming from payment plans due to COVID-19, with payments from plans representing 80% of our UK Division’s total Gross Debt Purchase Collections for the nine-month period. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we do not expect the pandemic to have a significant impact on our 120M ERC, as we believe that collections will be deferred rather than lost, and we believe we will be able to achieve projected Gross Debt Purchase Collections over the 120-month period. However, the circumstances around this pandemic are evolving and will continue to impact our business and estimation of expected Gross Debt Purchase Collections in future periods. We continue to assess the impact on our collections forecasts and, although we did not recognize material impairments to our owned debt portfolios due to COVID-19 for the three months ended September 30, 2020, it cannot be ruled out that such impairments will impact our net portfolio write-up for future periods. In the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recognized an £11 million net portfolio write down, representing 0.7% of the Group’s Portfolio Book Value. The net portfolio write down principally reflected the impact of the expected delay to a proportion of our UK Division’s collections as a result of the management actions undertaken. In the three months ended September 30, 2020, our UK Division’s Gross Debt Purchase Collections performance has been 102% of our June 30, 2020, forecast. We expect our Gross Debt Purchase Collections for full year 2020 to fall short of previous estimates and, notwithstanding COVID-19 related cost reduction measures, we expect Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA to slightly decline in the year ending December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 principally as a result of lower Portfolio Purchases and a delay in Gross Debt Purchases Collections due to the management actions taken in our UK Division. Cost control and increasing operational leverage continue to be a key focus for the Group. The Group’s Adjusted Cash EBITDA margin for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 was 57%, an increase of 600 basis points on the prior twelve-month period. Margin expansion has been driven by increased operational leverage of our indirect cost base together with improved collections efficiency. We continue to focus on customer care, reflected in our very strong Trustpilot score of 4.4/5. Digital channels continue to perform strongly, supporting customer engagement and collections and contributing to more efficient collections. We estimate the temporary reduction in legal fees related to litigation activities to have contributed to short term margin expansion of approximately 2%. Additional cost initiatives have been enacted in Q4-20, these are principally focused on further indirect cost efficiency to support sustainable margin expansion of approximately 300bps over the next 24 months. As a consequence of the timing of portfolio purchases, we expect total net leverage to increase slightly during this period. However, we expect the reduction in overall leverage to continue as we remain committed to our publicly stated leverage guidance of a consolidated total net leverage ratio in the range of 4.0x to 3.5x by 2021-2022. While we believe our stated leverage guidance to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information and this information may not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of the financial year or any future period. We continue to pragmatically assess the purchasing landscape and prioritize cash management, IRRs and liquidity. We expect to see significant increases in the volume of NPL write-offs in the near and medium term compared to 2019 in our regions and among our clients, which we expect will lead to significant near- and medium-term opportunities for debt portfolio purchases. We also expect that an overall increase in NPLs will lead to an increase in 3PC opportunities. We expect to purchase approximately £300 million of debt portfolios during 2020. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we expect to have drawn the equivalent of £    million under the Revolving Credit Facility, compared to £403.4 million as of June 30, 2020, having decreased our utilization between July 1, 2020 and the date of this Offering Memorandum in order to reduce our cash position. We continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure, including through monitoring the capital markets. The preliminary financial results as of and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020 presented above have not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors, nor have any procedures been performed by our independent auditors with respect thereto. Such information has been derived from management accounts, is preliminary and is subject to our financial closing procedures, which have not yet been ----- completed.

The Group does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future revenues, earnings, or other results. However, the management of the Group has prepared the prospective financial information adjusted for this non-IFRS measure to present the efficiency initiatives and cost savings estimated to be realized. The accompanying prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the International Federation of Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of the Group’s management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of the Group. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this offering memorandum are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information. Neither the Group’s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.

(b) Represents adjustments of £1.3 million in cost savings due to the closure of Fredrickson in the UK and £4.3 million in cost savings due to restructuring initiatives across our divisions (with £2.6 million in our UK Division, £1.4 million in our DACH Division and £0.3 million in our Northern European Division). The estimates presented above with respect to the run-rate effects of completed M&A and run-rate cost savings from restructuring and redundancies have been prepared using current estimates and taking into account certain assumptions about future operations, including overall performance and macroeconomic conditions. There can be no assurance that these completed mergers and acquisitions or restructurings and redundancies will have the desired outcomes and the costs associated with achieving them may outweigh any benefits. The foregoing assumptions underlying the adjustments involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from anticipated future results or performance expressed or implied by such adjustments. (5) We define Group cash income as Gross Debt Purchase Collections plus income from 3PC services. Group cash income represents our cash collections from owned debt portfolios plus cash commissions received from 3PC portfolios serviced. Lawyer service revenue is not included in Group cash income, as this revenue is generated on a largely pass-through basis, with costs incurred in connection with lawyer service revenue generally slightly exceeding such revenue. See “—Group cash income by segment for the twelve months ended _June 30, 2020” below._ (6) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents represents cash and cash equivalents of the Group as of June 30, 2020, as adjusted for the Offering (including the expected use of proceeds thereof), and excluding £66.9 million in restricted cash. As of June 30, 2020, we had £240.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding £66.9 million in restricted cash. See “Capitalization.” (7) As adjusted secured debt represents outstanding third-party indebtedness of the Group, excluding amounts outstanding under the Luigi Securitization and the Milla Securitization, as adjusted for the Refinancing as of the Issue Date. As of June 30, 2020, the Revolving Credit Facility was drawn in the amount of the euro equivalent of £403.4 million. As of the Issue Date, we expect we will have the equivalent of £      million drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. (8) As adjusted net secured debt represents as adjusted secured debt, which excludes amounts outstanding under the Luigi Securitization and the Milla Securitization, less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents (net of £66.9 million in restricted cash). (9) As adjusted total debt represents outstanding third-party indebtedness of the Group, including amounts outstanding under the Luigi Securitization and the Milla Securitization, as adjusted for the Refinancing. (10) As adjusted net total debt represents as adjusted total debt, which includes amounts outstanding under the Luigi Securitization and the Milla Securitization, less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents (net of £66.9 million in restricted cash). (11) As adjusted cash interest expense reflects the interest expense in respect of the Floating Rate Euro Notes, based on a margin of           % and assuming a constant EURIBOR rate (with a 0% floor), the interest expense in respect of the Fixed Rate Euro Notes, based on an interest rate of           %, the interest expense in respect of the Sterling Notes, fees under our Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any interest on drawings in the ordinary course of business) and fees under our securitization programs for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 as if the Refinancing had occurred on July 1, 2019.

However, our consumers in the UK can and do repay debt beyond ten years and, as a result, our UK Division continues to collect on assets beyond the initial 120 months and is able to imply its estimated collections across a 180-month period also. For more information about the calculation of ERC, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Estimated Remaining Collections (“ERC”).” (2) The DACH Division and the Northern European Division calculate their respective ERC based upon a 180-month period.

The label “unaudited” is used in the following tables to indicate financial data that has not been taken from the Audited Group Consolidated Financial Statements but rather was taken from the Unaudited Group Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or the Issuer’s internal reporting system, or has been calculated based on figures from these sources, as applicable. The information below is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations. The income statement figures for the year ended_ _December 31, 2017 included in the following tables are derived from the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements where the prior year comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 were retrospectively adjusted to reclassify net portfolio write-up under income for consistency with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2018 following the adoption of IFRS 9. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies— Reclassification of prior year presentation” to the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements. On March 20, 2018, we acquired Lowell Sverige (formerly Lindorff Sverige) and Lowell AS (formerly Fair Pay Please) (together with their respective subsidiaries), and their results have been consolidated with the Group’s beginning April 1, 2018. As a result, the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 are not directly comparable to those for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2019. The summary financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was derived by adding the condensed consolidated interim financial information of the Parent for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to the consolidated financial information of the Parent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and then subtracting the consolidated interim financial information of the Parent for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This twelve- month data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. The financial information for the six months or twelve months ended June 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period, including the year ending December 31, 2020, and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation. We present below certain non-IFRS measures and ratios that are not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS, including Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA and ERC, among others. There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The non-IFRS measures are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

Consequently we are exposed to changes in economic or fiscal conditions in each of our core markets and we are also exposed to any changes in the global macroeconomic environment affecting economic conditions in our core markets. If the global economy suffers a prolonged, material downturn that affects the markets we operate in through, among other things, an increase in the unemployment rate, increased inflation, the implementation of enhanced austerity measures (such as reduction in the relevant government’s provisions of public benefits and/or public sector employment), reduced disposable income, impacting interest rates, and the availability of credit, consumers may be unable or unwilling to continue repaying debt, and we may not be able to perform debt collection in a manner consistent with our past practice. If our consumers experience a reduced ability or willingness to pay their debt, we could face increased servicing costs and lower average payments, thereby reducing our cash generation and returns on capital, and, in turn, our ERC. Even if we are able to develop tailored payment plans for certain of the affected consumers in order to try to reduce the number of defaults, such measures may prove unsuccessful, or if the measures are successful in avoiding some defaults, total collections may be reduced or the timing of receipt of payments may be extended as a result of these measures. Additionally, adverse economic conditions could lead to a reduction in the propensity of financial institutions or other credit institutions to lend to corporations and individuals, as was the case during the global financial crisis of 2008 - 2009. This, in turn, could lead to a reduced supply of debt available for collection or fewer opportunities for us in our debt purchase business. Reduced lending by financial or other credit institutions may also negatively affect consumers by reducing disposable income levels or otherwise impairing their ability to fulfill their payment obligations. Furthermore, such a reduction in the propensity of financial institutions or other credit institutions to lend to corporations could adversely affect our own ability to obtain credit, and this may adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition by, inter alia, limiting our ability to finance portfolio purchases on financially favorable terms, or at all. An improvement in the economic conditions in our markets could have both positive and negative impacts on our business. Although improved economic conditions may lead to higher debt repayment due to the improved financial position of our consumers, this may also lead to more competitive pricing expectations for the debt portfolios that we purchase or for the debt collection services that we offer because of improved payment prospects. In addition, rising interest rates due to a change in the economic environment or other factors beyond ----- our control may increase our financing costs, which may result in our inability to make required capital investments or finance debt portfolio purchases on financially favorable terms or at all. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"We are subject to EU, UK, German and Norwegian regulations, among others, and changes to the regulatory environment or a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, authorizations, licenses and codes of practice may negatively affect our business.","As a business operating in the EU, UK, Germany and Norway, we are subject to a variety of national and EU regulations, including laws and regulations regarding data privacy, anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing, unfair competition, customer treatment, and price fixing. In case of non-compliance, the relevant authorities may, inter alia, impose a fine (on the business or senior management), public censure and remove or restrict an entity’s license. Furthermore, adverse regulatory developments under any of the laws and regulations applicable to our operations could expose us to a number of risks. Individual employees may act against our instructions and either inadvertently or deliberately violate applicable laws, including competition laws and regulations by engaging in prohibited activities such as price fixing or colluding with competitors regarding markets or clients. Such actions may harm our reputation and, if we are held responsible, the resulting fines and other sanctions could be substantial. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our UK Division, our DACH Division and our Northern European Division are also subject to various complex laws and regulations that are more specifically related to the CMS industry. See “Regulation” for additional information. _Regulations affecting our UK Division_ Our UK debt collection business is conducted through a number of subsidiaries. On April 1, 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) took over the regulation of consumer credit activities (as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001), including related debt purchase and debt collection activity, from the Office of Fair Trading (the “OFT”). All relevant UK Division companies now have such full FCA authorization. Our entities in the UK that collect debt due to third parties or collect debt that we have purchased under regulated consumer credit agreements are required to demonstrate that they continue to meet the FCA’s threshold conditions to maintain their authorization. In addition, certain individuals within the firm who exercise a “senior management function” in the business of the firm must be approved by the FCA as “Senior Managers.” These individuals must demonstrate on an ongoing basis that they are fit, proper and competent to hold the position of a “Senior Manager” and they must also comply with the FCA’s Senior Manager and Individual Conduct Rules as set out in the COCON Chapter of the FCA Handbook. The Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SM&CR”) came into force in December 2019, replacing the former Approved Persons Regime, with an increased focus on individual accountability. The three main elements of the SM&CR apply to every firm: (i) the Senior Managers Regime (which focuses on the most senior people in the firm who must have a statement of responsibilities and be pre-approved by the FCA to hold their function), (ii) the Certification Regime (which covers roles that have a big impact on customers, markets or the firm for whom the firm must certify that they are suitable to do their job at least annually) and (iii) Conduct Rules which apply to almost every person who works in financial services, and include things like “acting with integrity” and “treating customers fairly.” In addition to its broad fitness and proprietary requirements and the overarching requirements of the FCA’s Principles for Business, the FCA has created a sector specific Consumer Credit sourcebook (“CONC”) within the FCA Handbook which applies specifically to firms undertaking credit related activities and activities connected to those activities such as ours. CONC sets out detailed standards, in the form of specific rules and guidance. A properly authorized debt collection (or other consumer credit) business is also affected by, or subject to, numerous detailed legislative requirements, principally contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the “CCA”) and secondary legislation made under the CCA, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations ----- 1999 (the “UTCCRs”) and the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (the “CRA”). These legal requirements oblige creditors to, among other things: - provide consumers with prescribed forms of pre-contractual documentation; - provide consumers with prescribed credit agreement documentation at the outset; - enable consumers to obtain copies of credit agreement documentation; - provide consumers with prescribed forms of post-contractual statements and notices; - provide a “fair relationship” between themselves and the consumer; and - ensure that their agreements do not contain unfair terms (and stipulate that any unfair terms are void). A failure to comply with these requirements have differing consequences, but include causing agreements or certain terms to be deemed unenforceable either without a court order or until issues of noncompliance have been remedied (meaning that in some cases the outstanding debt and interest cannot be recovered). This could affect our ability to recover on the accounts underlying our owned debt portfolios in the UK or restrict important rights that we rely on. An agreement could be deemed unenforceable when we, as the debt collector or purchaser of the debt, or the originator, fail to comply with the applicable requirements. Failure to comply with any of these rules or guidance issued by the FCA may have serious consequences, for example: - The FCA may take enforcement action against a firm which could result in fines, public censure, the withdrawal of regulatory authorization and/or remediation action for consumers. Any such enforcement action would be publicly known and would involve severe reputational damage. Vendors of debt portfolios and creditors outsourcing collection activity may consider or be required to remove their business from a debt purchaser or collector that is the subject of such enforcement action; - Firms can be subject to a section 166 notice from the FCA, which may ensue where the FCA has identified issues within the firm regarding non-compliance with the FCA rules and guidance. Pursuant to a section 166 notice, the FCA either commissions, or requires the firm to commission, a “skilled persons” report. A “skilled persons” report is performed by an independent firm, usually an audit or law firm that is deemed by the FCA to have the necessary skills and expertise to review the areas of concern. The report is shared with the firm being reviewed and the FCA, which may decide to take enforcement action in relation to any weaknesses identified. Remedial action highlighted is tracked by the FCA through close liaison with the firm. Failure to remedy points raised and/or do so in sufficient time can lead to further enforcement action including fines. The cost of such a review is borne by the firm. A section 166 notice may become publicly available and we may be contractually obliged to notify clients should we become subject to such a notice. Clients may then consider, or be required, to remove their business from us, and consequently, our ability to win future business may be adversely affected. We might also be required, or otherwise decide, to introduce changes to our business practices in the UK in response to enforcement action taken against some of our competitors which highlights certain practices which are of concern to the regulator. The FCA regards debt collection (and debt purchasing) as a “high risk” sector based on the financial position of the consumers involved and issues of customer detriment, vulnerability and hardship are key areas of focus for the regulator. While we are not currently a subscriber to the Standards of Lending Practice (previously the Lending Code), a number of our clients in the UK are banks, and as such they must ensure that the third parties they use offer standards that meet the requirements of the Standards of Lending Practice. Furthermore, we may be subject to contractual obligations to observe certain requirements to ensure that our UK operations are conducted in a way that is consistent with certain FCA rules or requirements and certain provisions of the Standards of Lending Practice, including, for example, being subject to audits by debt originators. ----- In addition, our UK debt collection (and broader consumer credit) business is subject to an obligation to act fairly, as set out in the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Breach of certain of these regulations is a criminal offence. From October 1, 2014 consumers have also had a right of redress for misleading or aggressive commercial practices. Consumers who believe they have suffered as a result of our breaching these rules, or any of the applicable FCA rules, may complain to us first, and if we do not uphold their complaint, or we do not respond with the timescales stipulated under FCA rules, they may refer the matter to the UK Financial Ombudsman Service (the “FOS”), which acts as an independent adjudicator of the consumer complaints in respect of FCA & CCA regulated accounts. The FOS makes a decision based on what is fair and reasonable and good practice rather than strictly on the basis of compliance with the law. FOS cases attract a fee, which is paid by the business against whom the complaint is made, whether or not the complaint is upheld against the business (FOS do not charge a business for the first 25 cases that they deal with during the year). In certain situations we outsource some of our accounts to third party DCAs. This is usually as a result of our own internal collection activity coming to an end. Generally, the use of DCAs may represent one of the more significant conduct risks faced by us because, regardless of this outsourcing, we retain responsibility for the treatment of the customer and compliance with the applicable rules and therefore we deploy additional controls to monitor these DCAs. To the extent these third parties violate laws or other regulatory requirements in their collection efforts in the UK, it could also negatively impact our business by harming our reputation or, in some cases, resulting in penalties being directly imposed on us, as the FCA expects businesses to carefully select third parties with which they work and take responsibility for ensuring their compliance over the outsourced activity. We currently outsource in the UK to DCAs on a contingent basis. Although they are subject to quality checks to monitor that fair outcomes are being achieved, the DCAs are paid a commission based on collections achieved. Any change in laws or regulations restricting or prohibiting this practice of contingent collections could result in a change in our arrangements with DCAs in the UK to less variable cost structures, such as fixed fee arrangements. This would increase our fixed cost base, thereby causing our collection costs to rise without necessarily increasing collections. If such change of law or regulations were implemented in relation to the debt purchase and collection industries, this could negatively affect our ability to operate any DCA outsourcing successfully using our current outsourcing model in the UK, which could have an adverse effect on our financial returns and results of operations. We are not currently aware of any such proposal in relation to DCAs or other participants in the debt purchase and collection industries. Changes to the UK laws and regulations that affect us, or changes in the manner in which these laws and regulations are interpreted, could also negatively affect our operations or increase our cost of regulatory compliance. In October 2015, Lowell Solicitors Limited, a subsidiary, was granted a legal services license by the Solicitor’s Regulation Authority (the “SRA”) to undertake debt recovery litigation. Whilst this improves the operational efficiency of our debt recovery litigation, it also brings additional oversight and regulatory compliance requirements by the SRA. With the FCA as the regulator of consumer credit businesses, the regulatory focus is on requiring lenders (and debt collectors) to exercise “forbearance” in relation to consumer debt, to accept only affordable repayment offers and to have regard at all times to the “treating the customer fairly” principle underpinning the regulatory approach, in order to achieve fair consumer outcomes. This regulatory focus, which has gained increased importance in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, may have a detrimental impact on the profitability of issuing credit and the supply of debt portfolios for sale as well as increasing the oversight expectation of lenders who sell or outsource. A reduction in debt portfolios offered for sale in the UK market may lead to increased prices and lower returns on our investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In April and July 2020, the FCA provided guidance that regulated firms should provide tailored forbearance to customers, including 90 day payment deferrals that could be granted until the October 31, 2020. This was subsequently updated, with effect from October 2, 2020, such that customers who have received payment deferrals under the above guidance or who are experiencing payment difficulties as a result of circumstances relating to COVID-19 should continue to be treated fairly and the organizations should work with the affected customers to resolve any difficulties in advance of payments being missed or who continue to experience financial difficulties either currently or following a period of forbearance. ----- _Regulations affecting our DACH Division_ The CMS industry could be subject to increased scrutiny due to political factors, which could lead to changes in laws and regulations in Germany or the European Union. Changes in these laws and regulations, or changes to their interpretation by the relevant supervisory authorities and courts, may reduce our DACH Division’s operational flexibility and limit its ability to use its consumer data to price portfolios and create efficient debt collection strategies and regulate the fees, or potential setoffs of fees, charged to the consumer as part of a creditor’s default damage (Verzugsschaden), for example, under German law. In Germany, the regulatory framework for debt collection has been tightened by the Act Against Dubious Business Practices (Gesetz gegen _unseriöse Geschäftspraktiken) which came into force in October 2013. Under this regulation,_ _inter alia, the_ reimbursement of costs for debt collection is limited, and the costs may not exceed the amount a lawyer would be entitled to claim as compensation for a corresponding activity. Recently, the German government has published and introduced into the legislative process a “Draft law to improve consumer protection in debt collection law (Gesetz zur Verbesserung des Verbraucherschutzes im _Inkassorecht und zur Änderung weiterer Vorschriften).” The “Draft law to improve consumer protection in debt_ collection law” published by the German government would further tighten the regulatory framework for debt collection. The draft law foresees, inter alia, a reduction of the debt collection costs that are reimbursable by the creditor in certain cases. The current draft provides for an average reduction by approximately 30% but this would vary with the actual activities performed and the size of the claim. For very small claims (up to EUR 50.00), based on our current activities, the reduction could be approximately 55%. If the bill is passed by the German legislator in this form, it could have a material adverse effect on our DACH Division’s business, results of operations or financial condition. The Federal Association of German Debt Collectors (BDIU) has adopted a Code of Conduct that will enter into force at whatever time the “Draft law to improve consumer protection in debt collection law” proposed by the German government enters into force. The Code of Conduct will be binding on its member companies, including for the subsidiaries of SIR, GPP, PCS, IBW, ZYK, GCG, Tesch Inkasso Forderungsmanagement GmbH, Tesch Inkasso Finance GmbH, Tesch mediafinanz GmbH and Apontas GmbH & Co. KG. . Furthermore, a recent decision of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) of March 14, 2019 (case no. 4 StR 426/18) implies that in certain standardized debt collection processes, only a certain reduced amount of costs are reimbursable (however, the scope of this decision remains to be clarified). On September 9, 2020, the German parliament (Bundestag) debated a first reading of a draft bill presented by the German government on further shortening the residual debt discharge procedure (Entwurf eines _Gesetzes zur weiteren Verkürzung des Restschuldbefreiungsverfahrens) and subsequently referred it to the lead_ committee for legal and consumer protection for further discussion. The law is proposed to enter into force retroactively from October 1, 2020 and will enable natural persons being insolvency debtors, under certain circumstances, to be discharged from residual debt within 3 years (currently 5 years). The law shall apply to own applications by consumers, self-employed persons or former self-employed persons. Debtors who have filed their insolvency applications since December 17, 2019 may also benefit from this reduction retroactively and may also be able to obtain residual debt discharge in October 2023. The latter is still disputed, as the government draft had initially spoken of a residual debt discharge in July 2025 for these proceedings. In our current business model, our DACH Division generally attempts, in line with best practices in our industry, to achieve recovery of the full amount under the German statutory regime and applicable civil law. Income derived from these amounts, including as a result of lawyer service revenue, form a significant portion of Group cash income and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA. Depending on a variety of factors, including legal developments or reputational risks, we may alter our fee policies, which may impact the amount of fees that we can charge to our and our clients’ customers in Germany. Such alterations may limit our Gross Debt Purchase Collections and available cash and may have an adverse effect on our business. Changes in laws and regulations in particular in Germany or the European Union, or further developments in or changes to their interpretation by supervisory authorities and courts, including limits on the types and amounts of fees (including statutory fees) we and/or external lawyers can pass on to consumers (or a prohibition of such fees) and restrictions on our DACH Division’s ability to perform services for external lawyers could also affect the permissibility of our DACH Division’s business model. In particular, several of the regulations to which our DACH Division is subject and our interpretations thereof are based on a limited number of court decisions that are not all reconcilable. If court decisions in the future hold more consistently against our positions, our DACH Division’s business model could be adversely affected. Any change in these regulations, court decisions, or our interpretations thereof, and any other factors mentioned above may have a material adverse effect on our operations, business or financial position. ----- By regulation under the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für _Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), companies operating in certain industries are not allowed to sell their overdue and_ defaulted receivables to third parties (e.g., in the insurance industry for premiums). While it is prohibited to purchase their debt, we may provide these companies with up-front payments accounted for as purchased debt, which are made after the receivables have been transferred for service to our DACH Division. In exchange for providing up-front payment, we receive all further collections as a success fee. Such up-front payments only reflect a portion of what a similar debt portfolio may cost in an open market purchase, as our DACH Division purchases only the economic right to collect on a portfolio of debt, not full title to the underlying debt. However, it cannot be excluded that a debt servicing transaction including a third-party collection provider fee may be interpreted by the German regulator to be an unlawful sale or purchase of defaulted consumer debt, which may therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or reputation. Our DACH Division’s debt collection business may also be adversely affected by future supervisory and regulatory restrictions or qualifications. In particular, if the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) were to revise its interpretation of the relevant provision of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz—KWG) such that the ongoing purchase of receivables that are already due and payable qualifies as factoring, _i.e., the ongoing purchase of receivables in a commercial manner, and consequently also qualifies as the provision of financial services, our DACH Division’s debt collection business could become subject to potentially costly or burdensome licensing requirements under the German Banking Act. Furthermore, our Group’s companies that operate in Germany are allowed to conduct our debt collection business only if they are registered under the German Legal Services Act (Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz) which requires proof of aptitude and reliability, theoretical and practical expertise in the area of the legal services to be provided and professional liability insurance coverage. As of the date hereof, our subsidiaries SIR, GPP, PCS, IBW, ZYK, GCG, Tesch Inkasso Forderungsmanagement GmbH, Tesch Inkasso Finance GmbH, Tesch mediafinanz GmbH and Apontas GmbH & Co. KG are registered under the German Legal Services Act. If we fail to maintain these licenses, the relevant supervising authority may temporarily prohibit the companies implicated from conducting further debt collections. The supervising authority may also entirely revoke the registration for certain reasons, e.g., if our related insurance coverage is terminated or insufficient. Inability to obtain the registration would have a material adverse effect on our business. See “Regulation—Key Regulations _Affecting Our DACH Division—Regulation under the German Legal Services Regime.” Regulations affecting the Northern European Division_ The Northern European Division is subject to regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including laws and regulations regarding data protection, debt collection, debt purchasing, consumer credits, payment services, enhanced consumer protection and anti-money laundering and terrorist financing at the national and supranational level. See “Regulation—Key Regulations Affecting the Northern European Division.” As the Northern European Division increases its focus on certain business areas, such as offering credit rescheduling agreements (instalment plans), it may become subject to additional regulatory requirements, including with respect to anti-money laundering and verifying ownership of underlying assets. There can be no assurances that its policies and procedures will prevent breaches of applicable laws and regulations or that its investigations will identify such breaches in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. Adverse regulatory developments under the laws and regulations to which it is subject could expose it to a number of risks. In addition, from time to time the Northern European Division identifies weaknesses in its internal policies, procedures and controls. The Northern European Division cannot assure you that in the future it will identify such weaknesses or, where it does, remedy any such weaknesses in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. In a number of the markets in which the Northern European Division operates, including, in particular Norway, the regulation of other financial undertakings is in all material respects similar to the rules applicable for banks (including in respect of capital adequacy requirements). As a consequence, these financial undertakings may be subject to amended interpretations or decisions by supervisory authorities or new or amended legislation from the EU applicable to banks, including new or amended capital requirements and liquidity requirements. Such new or amended legislation and/or amended interpretation could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on the Northern European Division’s business, results of operations or financial conditions. Supervisory authorities in each country in which the Northern European Division operates may determine that it does not fully comply with, is in violation of, or in the past has violated applicable rules, regulations or administrative guidelines. If its policies and procedures are deemed not to be in compliance, or are ----- deemed not to have previously been in compliance, with relevant legal requirements or applicable laws, regulations or administrative guidelines, this could have a material adverse effect on the Northern European Division’s business, results of operations or financial condition. Licensing requirements for debt collection services differ from market to market. Many markets have a licensing requirement and supervision of compliance. In December 2016, the European Court of Justice (Third Chamber) ruled that a debt collection agency which concludes, on behalf of a lender, a rescheduling agreement for an unpaid credit, but which acts as a credit intermediary only in an ancillary capacity, must be regarded as being a credit intermediary and is not subject to the obligation to provide the consumer with pre-contractual information. Following the ruling, some countries in the EU have required debt collection companies that offer instalment plans to hold a consumer credit license so as to be bound by the relevant EU directive. Such license requirements have already been imposed in a few countries. Although large incumbent credit management providers, such as us, tend to be better placed to comply with a high regulatory burden, stricter regulations in general may increase our compliance burden and operating costs. Any temporary or permanent revocation of our debt collection licenses by the licensing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Some of the countries in which we operate have also implemented regulations providing limitations on costs for debt collection and duties of disclosure to consumer customers and such limitations on costs may come under increased regulatory focus by national governments. The credit management industry could be subject to increased scrutiny due to local political factors and developments, which could lead to changes in laws and regulations. The area of consumer credit has recently come under increased regulatory focus by national governments. For example, in October 2018 the Norwegian Ministry of Justice appointed a committee to review the DCA (the “DCA Committee”), including fee structures set forth therein. The DCA Committee is composed of representatives from the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, financial supervisory authorities, the consumer protection council, the banking and finance industry and from the debt collection industry. The DCA Committee presented their report on January 27, 2020 for consideration by the Norwegian Ministry of Justice. The DCA Committee’s proposal would reduce the amount of collection fees that may be charged on a sliding scale depending on the size of the overall claim, with the most significant reduction for smaller claims. The proposal has not yet been enacted. If enacted as proposed, we believe this will have a significant negative impact on the collections, results of operations and profitability of our Norwegian operations. Although the review of the 1988 debt collection legislation remains ongoing, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated changes to fee regulations. In response to the pandemic, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice issued an extraordinary public consultation and on June 19, 2020 approved a measure to reduce collection fees by up to 50% on claims falling due after October 1, 2020. The June 2020 fee reductions are expected to remain in effect until the ongoing review of the 1988 debt collection legislation is complete. Other elements of the review will continue to be considered as part of the legislative process. The June 2020 fee reductions will negatively impact collections, results of operations and profitability of our Norwegian operations. _Laws and Regulations affecting our Processing of Personal Data_ We handle and process large amounts of consumer personal data, such as names, account numbers, contact information and other account specific data. Our ability to obtain, retain, share and otherwise process this data is governed by data protection laws, privacy requirements and other regulatory restrictions, including the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)), the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, as amended (collectively, the “Data",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Protection Laws”).,13.2.1,,"Under GDPR, personal data must be processed fairly, lawfully and transparently. Personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and may only be processed in a manner consistent with these purposes. Personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and/or processed, and it must not be kept in a form that permits identification of consumers for longer than is necessary for those purposes. Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up-to-date. Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures the appropriate security of that personal data. Personal data must be processed in an accountable manner, i.e., so that compliance can be demonstrated. The Data Protection Laws require compliance with a series of stringent requirements regarding the processing of personal data. These include obligations to put in place detailed disclosures to inform customers ----- about how we may use their personal data, implement robust controls regarding security and access to data and ensure our customers have rights to access, control and delete their personal data. In addition, there are mandatory data breach notification requirements to the supervisory authority and in some instances, to the data subjects themselves. Furthermore, there are currently a number of additional proposals related to data privacy or security pending before legislative and regulatory bodies, any of which may require us to further modify our practices and policies. For example, the European ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC), which obliges EU member states to introduce certain national laws regulating privacy in the electronic communications sector, will soon be replaced by the EU “ePrivacy Regulation.” While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, recent European supervisory authorities (Germany, UK and France) have published guidance in the area of advertising, real-time bidding and cookies. In addition, European court decisions and court decisions in EU member states (for example, the recent CJEU decision on cookies in the Planet49 case (Germany)) as well as regulatory guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. As various supervisory authorities start to enforce the strict approach taken in their recent guidance, this could require us to incur substantial costs to bring our current operations and policies into compliance with the varying strategies in different markets, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of marketing activities, adversely affect margins and subject companies to additional liabilities. Regulation of cookies and similar technologies may lead to broader restrictions on marketing activities and could increase regulatory scrutiny and potential civil liability under data protection or consumer protection laws. Despite Brexit, the UK ICO has published its own guidance in the area of cookies, analytics, advertising and real time bidding which is largely consistent with the guidance issued by supervisory authorities in EU member states such as France, Spain and Germany. However, there are also jurisdictional differences that will make it more difficult to employ a common set of policies and marketing strategies for companies that market products throughout Europe. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice announced its judgment in case C-311/18 (the “Schrems",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,II case”) concerning the permissibility of transferring personal data from parties established within the EU to so-,13.3.1,Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.,"As a result of COVID-19 or other similar outbreaks or adverse public health developments, particularly in Europe and the United Kingdom, our operations may experience delays or disruptions, such as the temporary suspension of operations at one or more of our operating facilities. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19 or any other epidemic or outbreak harms the international economy in general. Furthermore, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect our operating results. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact us remains uncertain due to numerous evolving factors that we are unable to predict. Although COVID-19 has not had a negative material impact on our operational capabilities to date and although we believe that in the near- to medium-term it will create opportunities for debt portfolio purchases, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on our Group collections year to date and could have further material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition if: - the duration and scope of the pandemic result in sustained deterioration in the economic or inflationary environment in our regions; - political, legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic, such as governmental actions or proposed actions limiting debt collections efforts and encouraging or requiring extensions, modifications or forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees, prevent us from performing our collection activities, result in material increases in our costs to comply with such laws and regulations or result in fewer NPL debt portfolios coming to market; - disruptions to the court system and legal process that hinder our ability to collect through the litigation process are prolonged; - consumers respond to COVID-19 by failing to pay amounts owed on receivables owned or managed by us as a result of their unemployment or other factors that impact their ability to make payments; - we are unable to maintain staffing at the levels necessary to operate our business due to extended lockdowns, governmental actions that result in our business operations being deemed non-essential or ----- continued spread or increased virulence of COVID-19 causing employees to be unable or unwilling to work; - we are unable to collect on existing owned debt portfolios or experience material decreases in our collections; - we are unable to purchase debt portfolios needed to operate our business because debt owners become unable or unwilling to sell their NPL debt portfolios consistent with recent levels; - reductions in consumer spending could cause a decline in aggregate debt levels and limit our ability to purchase debt portfolios; - adverse capital and credit market conditions increase our cost of capital or affect our ability to meet liquidity needs; - we are required to increase spending on business continuity efforts and readiness efforts for returning to our offices, which may in turn require that we cut costs and investments in other areas; and/or - we suffer a cyber-incident or data or other regulatory breach as a result of increased vulnerability or weakened controls while a larger number of our employees work remotely. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—We are subject to EU, UK, German and Norwegian regulations, among others, and changes _to the regulatory environment or a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, authorizations, licenses and codes of practice may negatively affect our business,” “—Changes in the economic environment, in particular in the countries in which we operate, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, financial returns and results of operations,” “—We may not be able to successfully maintain and develop our IT infrastructure platform or decision science systems, anticipate, manage or adopt technological advances within our industry or prevent a breach or disruption of the security of our IT infrastructure platform and decision science systems” and “—Improper disclosure of our clients’ sensitive data, consumer data or a breach of Data Protection Laws could negatively affect our business or reputation.”_ To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect general economic conditions or our business, operations, financial condition or operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and potential decreases in our ability to purchase debt portfolios that are appropriately priced and of a sufficient quality. In addition, changes to the insolvency laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate in response to the pandemic may make it more difficult for holders of the Notes to pursue legal actions against us; for example: - On March 27, 2020, Germany adopted the Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic (as amended), which, _inter alia, provides for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency due to over-indebtedness until December 31, 2020 unless the insolvency is not caused by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This and other limitations set forth therein could make it more difficult for holders of the Notes to pursue legal actions against our German subsidiaries (see ""Certain _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany—Insolvency ”);_ - Norway recently adopted the Norwegian Temporary Act on Reorganization to Mitigate Economic Hardship Resulting from COVID-19, which provides certain limitations for creditors to file for insolvency and to enforce their security (see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Norway— Insolvency”);_ - The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 came into force in England on June 26, 2020. The legislation introduces both permanent and temporary reforms to the English insolvency regime, including temporary restrictions on certain types of enforcement action in respect of unpaid debts (see “Certain _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain_ ----- _Insolvency Law Considerations—England and Wales—Recent Reforms to the English Insolvency Regime”); and_ - The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has taken a number of exceptional measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a suspension of certain procedural deadlines applicable in civil and commercial matters. This suspension of deadlines applies to the one month procedural time-limit for the insolvency filing obligation provided by article 440 of the Luxembourg commercial code. In principle, such a suspension of delays should (i) not prevent directors / managers of a Luxembourg company from filing for bankruptcy upon their own motion (if the conditions thereof are met) and (ii) not restrict the rights of creditors to petition for bankruptcy of a Luxembourg company. Based on the current legislation, suspension of delays to file for bankruptcy within one month should remain in place until the end of 2020 (see ""Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and _Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Luxembourg”)._",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Our debt purchase business represented 82% of our Group cash income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 83% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. The availability of debt portfolios for sale at profit-generating prices depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including: - regulation of the consumer credit lending industry; - lenders changing credit origination strategies; - lenders tightening lending criteria; - the level of non-performance on consumer debt portfolios and the proportion of such portfolios that are written off by debt originators, which also in turn may affect the availability of credit to consumers identified above; - sales of debt portfolios by debt originators, which could be impacted by a change in accounting policies or practices, the consolidation of creditors or increased sophistication in internal collection efforts; - concerns that potential reputational risks or required management attention outweigh the return associated with selling defaulted debt portfolios; - negative publicity or a loss of trust in the CMS industry, whether due to our failure or that of one or more of our competitors to meet applicable legal or regulatory obligations or otherwise; - increased government regulation of the circumstances in which debt originators have a right to collect on debt; and the macroeconomic environment in the countries in which we operate, or to the extent that they may impact consumers or the domestic economy in such countries, macroeconomic conditions and other relevant global or European developments; - an increase in demand for debt portfolios among competitors could result in our not being chosen to purchase a debt portfolio due to more attractive offers from competitors. Furthermore originators may make a strategic choice to perform more of their own collections in-house or to rely more heavily on DCAs for initial collection efforts, there could be a reduction in the availability of debt that is sold early in the cycle and which has had little or no collection activity. For further discussion, see “—We _depend on the continued willingness and ability of our clients to outsource their debt collection and offer their portfolios for sale.”_ There can be no assurances that we will continue to be able to identify a sufficient volume of portfolios at appropriate prices. If the volume of debt sales or the quality of debt sold decreases, or the competition for purchasing such debt portfolios increases, we may not be able to buy the type and quantity of receivables at prices consistent with our historic return targets. Generally, prices vary significantly among industries. If we are unable ----- to identify portfolios at appropriate prices or that are of sufficient quality, we may need to purchase portfolios at higher prices, reducing our level of profit, or identify portfolios of asset types or in industries in which we have little or no experience, or where it is more difficult to collect on overdue receivables. Purchases in these asset types or industries may impair our ability to collect on these claims and may cause us to overpay for these claims. Consequently, we may not be able to meet our historical profit targets in respect of, or make any profit at all, from these debt purchases. The supply of debt portfolios available for purchase varies over time. This inconsistency in the availability of portfolios for purchase may mean that during certain financial reporting periods we may make few or no debt purchases. This could adversely affect our reported results. In addition, if any originators with which we have committed to purchase debt portfolios should fail to complete such sales, we may be unable to make such committed portfolio purchases. If we do not continually replace the debt portfolios we service with additional portfolios, our business could be materially and adversely affected. For further discussion of these risks, see “— _We depend on the continued willingness and ability of our clients to outsource their debt collection and offer their portfolios for sale.”_ If we are unable to identify sufficient levels of attractive portfolios and generate an appropriate return on purchased debt, we may experience difficulties covering the related expenses and may, as a consequence, need to reduce the number of our collection personnel or take other measures to reduce costs. These developments could lead to disruptions in our operations, loss of efficiency, decreased employee morale, fewer experienced employees and excess costs associated with unused space in our facilities and, as a result, a further loss of clients.

We may also enter into debt collection contracts at price levels or with margins that are lower than we find acceptable, if we want to develop a new relationship with an originator or get a foothold in new industries or if the overall competition for debt portfolios increases. We may not be afforded the opportunity in the future to bid on debt collection contracts that are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire if the existing contract is extended. In addition, we cannot be certain that all our existing clients will choose to continue to use our debt collection services for the same volumes of debt or at all in the future. Our inability to renew contracts with existing clients on similar terms or at all or to find suitable replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Debt originators may develop technological tools similar to ours, such as sophisticated decision science and consumer profile development that could increase their competitive advantages. If debt originators choose to perform more of their debt collections internally as a result of these data quality improvements, the volume of debt portfolios available for purchase could decrease and the quality of debt portfolios that are sold could suffer.

For example, in our DACH Division, in the year ended December 31, 2019, 82% of our portfolio purchases came from 10 vendors. In our UK Division, in the year ended December 31, 2019, 58% of our portfolio purchases came from five vendors.

A creditor’s decision to sell debt to us or contract with us for third-party collection services is based on price, reputation, compliance history and other factors. We cannot be certain that we will maintain our relationships with our current and/or future debt originator clients including large clients that make material contributions to our revenue. These clients may cease to offer us desirable terms or debt in acceptable quantities, or they may become insolvent or cease to exist. For example, our DACH Division lost one of the top 10 originators in its third-party collection services business in 2019 in a formal and competitive tender, mainly due to higher recovery rates offered by competitors that we believe are unrealistic. Furthermore, many of our contracts with our clients do not have a fixed term or renew automatically and, therefore, may be terminated on relatively short notice in certain circumstances. Any changes to the key relationships that we rely on could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. A significant decrease in the volume of debt portfolio purchases available from any of the debt originators with which we are currently working, on terms acceptable to us, would make it necessary to further enlarge our network of sellers or the sources of debt to purchase. Furthermore, because reputation is paramount in our industry, the loss of a key vendor relationship could jeopardize our existing relationship with other vendors or our ability to establish new relationships with other vendors. We may be unable to find alternative sources from which to purchase debt, and even if we could successfully replace such purchases, the search could take time, and the receivables could be of lower quality or higher cost, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. See “—A decrease in our ability to purchase debt portfolios or an insufficient supply of debt, appropriately priced _debt or debt of a sufficient quality could materially and adversely affect our business.”_ In addition, we face supply risks, including certain single-source supply risks. In particular, our UK Division relies on a single supplier for a substantial amount of its consumer credit data (for further discussion of this risk, see “—We are highly dependent on our intelligence systems and proprietary consumer profiles”), and our DACH Division relies heavily upon one supplier for certain software solutions. If any of these suppliers were to significantly limit access to their services, significantly raise their prices, experience labor disputes and work stoppages, become insolvent or cease to exist, this could impede our ability to collect on claims or increase our collections costs and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

In addition, the UK debt purchase market has recently experienced significant capital inflows. Furthermore, average portfolio purchase prices in the UK debt purchase market are expected to increase over the coming years due to: (i) improvements in collection efficiencies; (ii) sustained competition for the purchase of portfolios; and (iii) greater proportions of the portfolios sold containing fresher debt, with a higher proportion of paying accounts. We may also face competition in this market from financial investors (i.e., those more suited to the purchase of a portfolio consisting of largely paying accounts, such as institutional investors). Moreover, such competition, also driven by greater financial resources, less expensive funding or lower return requirements, may lead to an increase in the purchase price demanded by debt originators for their debt portfolios, which we may not be willing or able to offer. Our UK business mainly focuses on the purchase of debt portfolios. Some of our competitors have more significant UK DCA businesses in addition to operations involving the purchase of debt portfolios. These competitors may be able to offer originators a more attractive suite of services, or they may be able to use the consumer data provided at the DCA stage to help them price debt portfolios more accurately, or collect debt receivables more effectively or efficiently, than we can. ----- There can be no assurance that we will be able to offer competitive bids for debt portfolios, or that we will be able to maintain the advantages in tracing technology, consumer profile development, or low servicing costs that we believe that we currently possess in the UK market. If we are unable to develop and expand our business or adapt to changing market needs as well as our current or future competitors are able to do, or if our competitors are able to make advances in their pricing or collections methods that we are not able to make, we may be unable to purchase debt portfolios at prices we deem appropriate in order to operate profitably in the UK. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. _Competition in the German market_ The German debt collection market is highly fragmented and consists of numerous companies with varying profiles. These companies compete with us on, among other things, the basis of price. New entrants to the German market and existing competitors may offer more attractive pricing levels, both for debt collection contracts and for debt portfolio purchases, and accept lower returns in order to gain or increase market share. There can be no assurances that this price competition will not result in us paying higher prices for portfolios that we purchase or charging less for our debt collection services, both of which could decrease our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We face bidding competition in our acquisition of debt portfolios in the German market. We believe that successful bids are awarded based on price and a range of other factors, including service, compliance, reputation and relationships with the sellers of debt portfolios. Some of our current competitors, and potential new competitors, in the German market may have more effective pricing and collection models, greater adaptability to changing market needs and more established relationships in our industry or the business sectors in which we operate. Moreover, our competitors in the German market may elect to pay prices for debt portfolios that we determine are not economically sustainable and, in that event, our volume of debt portfolio purchases may decrease. There can be no assurance either that our existing or potential debt portfolio sources within the German market will continue to sell their portfolios at recent levels or at all, or that we will continue to make competitive bids for debt portfolios. Some of our current competitors, and potential new competitors, in the German market may have substantially greater financial resources, less expensive funding or lower return requirements than we currently have. The CMS industry in Germany might further consolidate and our competitors might merge, creating size and scale benefits that we might not be able to match. In addition, in the future we may not have the financial resources to make competitive bids for portfolio purchases and debt collection contracts, especially when competing with competitors that have greater financial resources than we have. Competition is not limited to the bidding process, as some of our clients will simultaneously retain multiple CMS companies to perform collections on their behalf, thereby intensifying the competition for ongoing and new business. There can be no assurances that we will be able to develop and expand our business in Germany or adapt to changing market needs as well as our current or future competitors. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. _Competition in the Northern European market_ The Northern European CMS industry is fragmented and consists of competitors with varying profiles. The Northern European Division faces competition from new and existing debt collection providers, other purchasers of portfolios of overdue debt and other overdue receivables and debt originators that manage their own portfolios rather than outsourcing or selling them. This competition includes, but is not limited to, competition on the basis of price. New market entrants and existing competitors may offer more attractive pricing levels, both for debt collection contracts and for debt portfolio purchases, and accept lower returns in order to gain or increase market share. There can be no assurances that this price competition will not result in the Northern European Division paying higher prices for portfolios that it purchases or charging less for its debt collection services, both of which could decrease its margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. _Competition in other markets_ We also operate in Austria and Switzerland and have minor operations in Croatia. In the future, we may expand into additional markets. We face significant competition in each of our current markets and expect to face significant competition in any other market that we may enter into in the future.

Our reputation is fundamental to maintaining our relationships with current and potential clients and regulators. The following events, among others, may have a negative effect on our reputation and/or our financial results: negative media publicity relating either to us or the wider CMS industry, allegations of unethical or improper behavior by us or third parties we use in the collection process, our inability to collect debt on an accurate and timely basis, our failure to respect and treat the consumers fairly, failures in our collection and data protection processes, the actions of third parties engaged by us in the debt collection process, IT platform failure or other operational issues, litigation, regulatory restrictions, investigations, fines or enforcement actions and matters affecting our financial reporting. The collection of debt involves interpretations of contractual terms that may vary by debt originator, which may impact the calculation of consumers’ resulting payment obligations and the collection strategies we employ. The inherent complexity of debt calculation and historical inaccuracies may result in our failure to choose the appropriate collection strategies and could lead to incorrect payment calculations in the future. Furthermore, under German law, if we agree on a payment plan with a consumer based on an incorrect calculation of the debt, such payment plan will become binding and may not be renegotiated. Therefore, processing errors may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Such processing or other operational errors could lead to an increase in new consumer complaints which could harm our reputation with debt originators, consumers and/or regulatory authorities. Any of the aforementioned events could thereby result in financial liability for us and could jeopardize our relationships with the debt originators with which we have already established a business relationship or our ability to establish new relationships with other debt originators, have a negative impact on a consumer’s willingness to pay a debt owed to us or to our clients, diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty or lead to increased regulation of the CMS industry, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

These factors include, inter alia: (i) publications in online, print and broadcast media, from time to time, of stories about the debt collection or debt purchase industry that may cite specific examples of real or perceived abusive collection practices as well as regulatory investigations and enforcement actions; (ii) online articles, blogs and tweets that may lead to the rapid dissemination of a story and increase exposure to negative publicity surrounding the debt purchase and CMS industry in general or in relation to us or any of our clients in particular; (iii) websites where consumers list their concerns about the activities of debt collectors and seek online guidance from others on how to react to collection efforts and (iv) the activities of commission driven claims management companies bringing complaints about our activity on behalf of individuals or a cohort of customers. These websites are increasingly providing consumers with letter templates, guidance and other strategies to protest collection efforts and to try to avoid their obligations. To the extent that these forms and strategies are based upon erroneous legal information, ----- the cost of collections may increase. Finally, in Germany, consumer blogs and consumer protection associations (Verbraucherschutzvereine) are becoming more common and add to the negative attention surrounding the CMS industry. Negative publicity could also result from us being named in published industry complaint data sites, receiving negative attention due to internal disputes, failing to prevent potential unlawful behavior of our employees and engaging in disputes with former employees or being subject to negative publicity relating to any of our clients or any former employers of our key executives. Negative publicity relating to violations by any of the third parties we engage, of legal or other regulatory requirements, could also result in negative publicity or reputational damage to us. Any such negative publicity could jeopardize our existing relationships with debt originators or our ability to establish new relationships with other debt originators, diminish our attractiveness as counterparties generally or lead to requests by the debt originator to reassign debt portfolios.

Under most of our debt collection contracts we do not get paid unless a consumer begins paying on a claim and we may be unable to accurately predict the costs or identify the risks associated with these contracts or the complexity of the services, which may result in lower than expected margins, losses under these contracts or even the loss of clients. Some of our material contracts for debt collection services subject us to early termination clauses in a range of circumstances and also include benchmark clauses or, in a small number of contracts, penalties and /or service credits for the failure of service level agreements. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of our contracts, then we could potentially have contracts terminated and lose clients and income. The majority of our material debt collection contracts have an initial stated term, typically one to three years, and, in some cases, termination clauses permitting the debt originator to cancel the contract at its discretion following the expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurances that our clients will not exercise their rights to terminate their contracts prior to expiration or that we will be successful in negotiating new contracts with clients as such contracts expire. In addition, we are also exposed to unforeseen changes in the scope of existing contracts, including prices or volumes, that may occur as a result of any changes in the general business or political landscape of our clients. Generally, our debt collection contracts do not have volume commitments, and a client can eliminate or reduce the volume of claims it outsources to us for debt collection without formally terminating the contract. We may have disputes or disagreements with our clients as to the level of services we have agreed to provide or contract terms. The potential effects of these risks may increase as we enter into larger contracts. If we are unable to fulfill our obligations under our contracts for any reason, we risk the loss of revenue and fees under that contract, the potential loss of a client and significant harm to our reputation. Any of our contracts could become more costly than initially anticipated, and as a result, we may experience significant increases in our operating costs and/or potential litigation. Furthermore, we may experience delays in integrating with our existing operations any additional collection platforms that we acquire or the carve-outs of our clients’ in-house collections departments.

We do not have an insurance policy that covers breaches of guarantees, representations and warranties with respect to the quality of the purchased debt in our debt purchase agreements. Therefore, we may not be able to pass on the losses in the event that we cannot take recourse against the seller. We purchase debt mainly at a discount to face value, except for small amounts of debt purchased through our DACH Division’s historical PayProtect service, for which we pay the full face value of the debt. The Northern European Division also provides value-added services which purchase debt at full face value. Debt that we purchase typically consists of loans that consumers have failed to repay and, in certain cases that the debt originator has deemed to be uncollectable. It is crucial for our business that we are able to identify debt portfolios that are of sufficient quality for us to determine what we are likely to collect on the claims. Before making the decision to sell their overdue or defaulted debt and other overdue receivables, clients usually make various attempts to recover on such receivables, often using a combination of in-house recovery efforts and third-party collection agencies. These overdue claims are difficult to collect and we may not collect a sufficient amount to cover our investment associated with purchasing the debt portfolios of overdue receivables and the costs of running our business. There can be no assurances that any of the claims contained in our owned debt portfolios will eventually be collected. Furthermore, most of the debt claims that we own are unsecured and an increase in bankruptcy filings involving consumers could impact our ability to collect on those claims. If the cash flows from our existing owned debt portfolios (and the debt portfolios we purchase in the future) are less than anticipated, we may be unable to purchase all of the new debt portfolios that we would like to purchase, may need to pay a higher interest rate to finance the purchase of new debt portfolios or may need to accept lower returns.

Debt originators from both our third-party collection services and purchased debt businesses may also restrict our flexibility in pursuing certain enforcement and collection activities. In addition, our clients may have the right to compel us to undertake or refrain from taking certain actions, including agreeing the fees that we can pass through to the respective consumers.

There is sometimes a gap between the point in time when we purchase a portfolio and the point in time when we begin earning returns on the purchased portfolio.

These estimates and assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift over time, based on changes in accounting policies, accounting standards or our business profile. Complex judgments are required in relation to revenue recognition, impairment of our purchased loan portfolios, collection forecast and impairment tests of our goodwill, among others. For example, the estimates used to calculate our returns on our owned debt portfolios are primarily based on historical cash collection experience and payer dynamics. If future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing, our earnings could be affected, either positively or negatively. Higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected will have a favorable impact on revenue in the form of income increases or impairment reversals. In addition, higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected could have the effect of reducing the expected future value of our loan portfolios, requiring us to purchase additional loan portfolios in order to maintain our level of expected future cash flows, which we might not be able to do. Lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected will have an adverse impact and may result in an impairment of the purchased loan portfolio. Impairments, in turn, cause reduced and fluctuating earnings.

Any failure by these third parties to adequately perform collection services for us or to remit such collections to us could materially reduce our cash flow, income and profits. We rely on these third parties to effectively manage their operations and to meet our servicing needs efficiently, but these third parties may not have the resources, management training and management depth that we have. This may negatively impact their ability to comply with applicable laws or other regulatory requirements. To the extent these third parties violate laws or other regulatory requirements in their collection efforts, it could negatively impact our business and reputation, and we may not be aware of the risk or occurrence of any such violation. If any of these suppliers were to significantly limit access to their services, significantly raise their prices, experience labor disputes and work stoppages, become insolvent or cease to exist, this could impede our ability to collect on claims or increase our collections costs and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any of these developments could hinder or prevent us from using our decision science as part of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Since 2016, we have acquired IS Inkasso Service, Tesch Group, Apontas, Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS, Lucas Credit Services Ltd and Solvencia AS. The continuation of this strategy depends on, inter alia, identifying suitable acquisition or investment opportunities and successfully completing such transactions. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify or complete purchases or acquisitions in the future. Furthermore, it may take longer than expected to realize projected benefits from such future purchases or acquisitions because we often cannot control the timing ----- of the closing of such transactions. Moreover, successful completion of an acquisition may depend on consents from third parties, including regulatory authorities and private parties, which are beyond our control. If we carve-out in-house collections operations from our clients or wholly acquire other CMS companies, we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses with our own and we may be unable to maintain our standards, controls and policies, which may result in compliance issues, goodwill write offs and damage to our reputation. Our successful integration of acquired businesses will depend on our ability to effect any required changes in operations or personnel, and may require other capital expenditure or the funding of unforeseen liabilities. In addition, the integration and operation of any future acquisitions may expose us to certain risks, including difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses in a cost effective manner and establishing effective management information and financial control systems, the diversion of management’s attention from our dayto-day business, the failure to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided, transition difficulties with clients and unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisitions. Any failure to assess suitable acquisitions or to properly integrate them once acquired could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any of the anticipated benefits from our prior acquisitions will be realized or that we will be able to realize such benefits from any future acquisition. In addition, our acquisitions and future acquisitions may place additional constraints on our resources, including diverting the attention of our management from other business concerns or opportunities. Furthermore, acquisitions expose us to the risks associated with write-downs and impairments to goodwill. Integration of the businesses and carve-out assets we acquire may require significant financial and operating resources and exposes us to a variety of risks. For example, our ability to maintain our standards, controls, policies and the quality of services that we have historically provided could be compromised while we are in the process of integrating a recently acquired business, and this could result in compliance issues, goodwill write-downs and damage to our reputation. Additionally, the successful integration of any businesses we acquire depends on our ability to make required changes in operations or personnel quickly and effectively, and achieving this may require further capital expenditure or the funding of unforeseen liabilities. Moreover, difficulties with establishing effective management information and financial control systems, the diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business, difficulties with transitioning clients and unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisitions could also arise in connection with our integration of acquired businesses. In March 2018 we acquired Lowell Sverige and Lowell AS and in July 2019 we acquired Lucas Credit Services Ltd. We have made efforts to integrate these new entities into our corporate division and will perform similar integration activities for Solvencia AS which was acquired on September 30, 2020; however, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that we will realize the expected benefit, or any benefit at all, from these acquisitions. We currently operate primarily in the UK, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Austria with a meaningful presence in Switzerland. If we expand into new jurisdictions through future acquisitions, our business will be subject to applicable laws, regulations and licensing requirements in those new jurisdictions, which may be different or more stringent than those currently applicable to our business. Such expansion would also subject us to additional risks related to inflation, recession, currency and interest rate fluctuations, an inability to enforce remedies, difficulty in adequately establishing, staffing and managing operations, risk of noncompliance and business integrity issues, variations in regulation and governmental policies, including additional fees, costs and licenses, and risk of political and social instability within those jurisdictions.

If this private supplier were to terminate its agreement with us or stop providing us with data for any reason, or if such private supplier were to considerably raise the price of its services, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Also, if any of the information or ----- data that we use became public, for example due to a change in government regulations, or if the UK were to introduce measures that have the effect of facilitating the tracing of consumers, we would lose a significant competitive advantage and our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, private or public sources of our data could make claims that the way in which we collect or use information and data violates terms and conditions applicable to such use, and whether or not such claims have any merit, our reputation could be harmed and our ability to continue to use such information and data in the manner in which it is currently used could be impaired. If our competitors are able to develop or procure similar systems or methods to develop data, or if we become unable to continue to acquire or use such information and data in the manner in which it is currently acquired and used, we would lose a significant competitive advantage and our business could be materially and adversely affected.

To the extent any of these systems, technologies or programs do not function properly and we cannot find and retain a suitable IT provider to help remedy the fault, we may experience material adverse effects on our business that require substantial additional investments to remedy, or which we may not be able to remedy at all. Furthermore, as some of the systems, technologies and programs that we use have been developed internally, we cannot be assured that our level of development documentation is comparable to that of third party software packages and we may have certain employees that possess important, undocumented knowledge of our systems.

This dependency subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems as well as reliance on certain external suppliers for the ongoing provision of support services, including impairment of our information technology, substantial capital expenditures and demands on management time. For example, the carve-out of in-house collection operations or the acquisition of another company may force us to upgrade the IT platform and decision science systems of the newly acquired operations or entity to meet our standards, causing increased capital expenditures and demands on management time. IT and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life cycles. We may not be successful in anticipating, managing or adopting technological changes on a timely basis. We may not be successful in implementing improvements of our IT or decision science systems and improving operation efficiency through further IT development, which could result in additional costs. The cost of these improvements could be higher than anticipated or result in management not being able to devote sufficient attention to other areas of our business. We depend on having the capital resources necessary to invest in new technologies to purchase and service claims, and there can be no assurances that adequate capital resources will be available to us at the appropriate time. Furthermore, if we become unable to continue to acquire, aggregate or use such information and data in the manner or to the extent in which it is currently acquired, aggregated and used, due to lack of resources, regulatory restrictions or any other reason, we may lose a significant competitive advantage. For example, in Germany we hold a data trading license that provides us with the future potential to enter into the data trading field and leverage our extensive databases. However, this and other potential initiatives are not yet fully developed and may not achieve their desired results, which could cause us to lose valuable market opportunities and fall behind our competition in advanced decision science. Any security breach in our IT infrastructure platform and decision science systems, or any temporary or permanent failure in these systems, could disrupt our operations. We may be required to enhance capabilities and resilience and we may be subject to future attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential or sensitive information. Our websites could potentially suffer cyber-attacks, which could disrupt our IT infrastructure ----- platform and decision science systems and impair our ability to provide online services.

If our equipment or systems cease to work or it becomes difficult to continue to use them in the same manner as we do today as a result of any regulatory development, we may be prevented from providing services and we may not be able to collect on the receivables we have purchased. We may face similar consequences if there is any change in the telecommunications market that would affect our ability to obtain favorable rates on communication services or if there is any significant interruption in internet or telephone services.

Other risk management methods depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets, debt originators, DCAs, consumers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. We rely on intermediaries such as DCAs, and we may be held liable for the acts of intermediaries if we cannot demonstrate that we have adequate procedures in place to prevent risks such as bribery. For example, debt originators typically require us to assume responsibility for the acts of their respective third-party intermediaries in relation to ongoing compliance matters.

In some cases, such remediation exercises may result in the amounts of compensation exceeding the purchase price and therefore resulting in total loss of the portfolio value and potentially additional expenditure on our part. The quality of historical consumer documentation may not allow, in each case, the discovery of past breaches relating to form and content requirements that would impair our ability to correctly assess the value of the portfolio, resulting in the risk of loss or reduction in the particular owned debt portfolio’s value. As our business relies on our ability to enforce the contracts underlying our owned consumer accounts, a contract found to be invalid or unenforceable could hinder our ability to recover from purchased accounts. If we purchase debt portfolios containing too many accounts that do not conform to the terms of the purchase contracts or contain accounts that are otherwise uncollectable or unenforceable, we may be unable to recover a sufficient amount, or anything at all, and such a portfolio purchase could be unprofitable. Additionally, we may be unable to ascertain whether the debt originator has been in compliance in connection with the underlying accounts at a sufficiently early stage. With respect to any future acquisitions of other debt collection companies, we may not have any contractual protection in relation to liabilities or operating or other problems in relation to the loan portfolios of the acquired company, and we may not discover such shortcomings until after completion of such ----- acquisitions. This could lead to adverse accounting and financial consequences, such as the need to make substantial provisions against the acquired assets or to write down acquired assets. For a significant number of portfolios, particularly in Germany, we act as beneficial owner. We may not be able to collect on a portfolio to which someone else holds legal ownership, or we may need to spend time and resources establishing our own legal ownership of the portfolio if such ownership was unclear. Moreover, in instances where underlying documentation does not prove the existence, ownership or enforceability of an account, or where an account balance is incorrect, we may not always have the right to transfer such accounts back to the debt originator. Additionally, in such instances, we may be contractually required to repurchase accounts that we have subsequently sold to third parties. Furthermore, enforcement of claims under German law generally requires a creditor to obtain an execution title (Vollstreckungstitel). An execution title is not automatically transferred with the underlying claim. An execution title is generally rendered in the name of a specific creditor that has the sole right to enforce the claim. Although for many of our German portfolio debt purchases we benefit from acting as a beneficial owner with the original creditor as trustee, which allows us to enforce on the basis of existing execution titles, we may not be able to enforce the claim using the existing execution title if the original creditor is no longer available to serve as trustee, e.g., in the event that the creditor is liquidated. We also may not use an existing execution title if we are the legal owner of the claim. In such situations, an execution title must be amended by way of a circumscription of title (Titelumschreibung), subject to certain legal requirements set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung). This procedure allows other persons who are not named in the respective execution title to use it for enforcement. The circumscription of title bears additional cost and time that is incurred for any single claim and may result in considerable additional expense. Additionally, under certain circumstances it may be difficult or impossible to achieve a circumscription of title, e.g., if the documentation required by law is not available or the original creditor ceases to exist, which may prevent us from enforcing a claim.

Our results of operations and financial condition are dependent on our ability to generate collections from overdue receivables, which in turn is impacted by the ability of consumers to pay. The ability of consumers to refinance their existing debt, as well as annual cycles in disposable income, could result in a reduction in the volume of NPLs available for collection or purchase. Furthermore, collections within portfolios tend to be lower in months where there are fewer working days, for example months with public holidays. In addition, we are exposed to quarterly variations in our operating results, which may be affected by the timing of the closing of debt portfolio purchases, which we often cannot control and may be uneven during the year, and the speed with which we can integrate the portfolios into our systems.

The decision means that the certification that companies have previously been able to rely on when transferring personal data to the United States, the so-called “Privacy Shield” was declared void with immediate effect. Furthermore, the ruling also sets out further requirements on the use of EU standard contractual clauses for transfers of data to countries outside the EU, including the United States. The data exporter and the data importer must assess in detail and on a case-by-case basis whether these clauses are sufficient safeguards and if not the case implement additional safeguards. With regard to the standard contractual clauses, it is still uncertain to what extent different types of security measures and procedures will be required to comply with GDPR after the ruling. The court decision and further guidance from local data protection authorities in this respect could make it more difficult for us to transfer data to the United States or other third countries in which we operate If this is not possible, then supplementary measures are required or the data transfer must be halted. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has yet to define what supplementary measures might entail. The Information Commissioners Office in the UK has advised that UK organizations need to take stock of international data transfers and update practices as more guidance is given. With regard to personal data regulation in the UK, following the end of the Transition Period (the transition period following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, currently set to expire at 11:00 p.m. (GMT) on December 31, 2020), we will have to comply with both the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act, as amended. The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, e.g. how data transfers between EU member states and the UK will be treated and whether the Information Commissioner’s Office can continue to act as a lead supervisory authority. Changes in regard to the UK’s data protection relationship with the EU may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk profile. In addition to the risk of regulatory fines imposed under Data Protection Laws, infringement of these laws can lead to reputational risk and significantly undermine customers’ trust in the organization. We further note that the UK FCA is particularly focused on operational resilience and has taken action, including the imposition of significant financial penalties, against regulated firms which have suffered incidents leading to the loss, disclosure or mishandling of customer data. We rely on our decision science systems to record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately for our debt collection activities and for our analysis of potential debt purchases. Our ability to conduct ----- our business, including our ability to price the purchase of portfolios, trace consumers and develop tailored repayment plans, depends on our ability to use the consumer data we collect for these purposes. We could lose a significant competitive advantage and our business could be negatively affected, if: - any of the information or consumer data that we use were to become public; - a change in legislation, client requirements or a change in a regulator’s interpretation of the current data protection legislation were to prohibit us from using consumer data in the manner or to the extent which it is currently used; - a government or regulator introduced measures that had the effect of facilitating the tracing of consumers; or - the current data processing restrictions changes so that credit market participants could access credit information before the purchase of portfolios. The “Data Protection by Design and by Default” concept has required a reappraisal of our IT and Business Change and Procurement approaches to integrate data protection into our processes, practices and systems from the design stage through the lifecycle. This includes carrying out data protection impact assessments, ensuring that data minimization is embedded across the business so that only the appropriate amount of data required for any particular purpose is processed, deleting unnecessary data and anonymizing data wherever possible. Our GDPR program identified risks and associated mitigation plans and we adopted a risk based approach to their prioritization. A privacy operating model has been defined with clear roles and responsibilities and is in the process of being embedded in all regions. Further automation and system change is planned via other strategic programs, which will continue to mature our capability and privacy management framework to strengthen compliance with Data Protection Laws. GDPR requires us to maintain technical and organizational security measures in respect of all personal data we process. Under the GDPR, we are required to notify the applicable supervisory authorities (and where the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the applicable data subjects) should we commit a personal data breach. Certain of our contracts with clients also impose additional obligations in the event of a personal data breach. Clients may have the contractual right to seek indemnity from us in respect of such breaches in certain instances. They may also consider removing their business from us. Our revenue related to such business, along with our reputation, and consequently, our ability to win future business may be adversely affected in those circumstances. GDPR imposes certain direct obligations on data processors (which are entities processing personal data on behalf of the controller) and requires contractual obligations to be implemented between all data controllers (which are entities determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data) and processors. Thus, as a controller, we must have specific instructions and agreements with our services providers (processors) about how they handle personal data and, as a processor, we must follow the instructions of any controllers which share data with us. As a controller we are fully liable for data processing performed by our processors. Unfavorable decisions or judgments based on an infringement of the GDPR may result in sanctions and the payment of regulatory up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual group turnover. After Brexit, we will face the potential for double regulatory fines in both the UK and the EU. In addition to data protection sanctions from a supervisory authority, other regulators may impose sanctions or fines as a result of such actions; GDPR provides a private right of action for material or non-material damage caused by processing that infringes the GDPR, thus there is a possibility of civil actions brought by data subjects. Any claims or challenges regarding our data handling practices would also likely attract - increased costs for insurance and indemnity cover due to cyber threats and significant expenses of data breach investigation, remediation and notification; - increased requirements in type and level of personnel including IT, marketing and regulatory compliance professional as well as training; and - negative media publicity and reputational damage. ----- In Germany, on May 25, 2018, the new Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018) entered into force together with the GDPR. Although a national data protection law still exists in Germany, the GDPR standardizes the data protection principles in Germany, such regime having, inter alia, the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million and 4% of global turnover. In addition, depending on the nature of the infringed provision, non-compliance with Data Protection Laws may also lead to civil liabilities and criminal sanctions or fines under the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018). Specific provisions in the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018) regulate the legitimacy of credit reporting and scoring as well as transparency requirements for such types of data processing. It may only be used if data protection rules are met, if relevant data are used and if the score is based on acknowledged, reliable mathematical-statistical methods. If address data are used the law requires a prior notice to the data subject. The use of a probability value calculated by credit reporting agencies to determine a natural person’s ability and willingness to pay is subject to further requirements stipulated in the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018). See “Regulation—Key Regulations Affecting Our DACH Division—Data Protection in Germany and in Austria.” Compliance with this extensive and evolving regulatory framework is expensive and labor intensive. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules could result in investigations and enforcement actions, criminal charges, compensation claims, permissions that we need to do business not being authorized or being revoked, fines or the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct collections. In addition, such failure to comply or revocation of a permission, or other actions by us that may damage the reputation of the originator would entitle our clients to terminate their forward flow agreements or repurchase portfolios we have previously purchased from them. It would also entitle a creditor that had placed accounts with us for collection to terminate the servicing contract and remove the accounts from us. Any of these developments could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct business or on our financial condition, our financial returns or our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Currency exchange fluctuations could cause losses if assets denominated in currencies with a falling exchange rate lose value, while at the same time liabilities denominated in currencies with a rising exchange rate appreciate. As a result of these factors, fluctuations in exchange rates could affect our results of operations. For example, we present our consolidated financial reports in pound sterling but the operations of our DACH Division are primarily conducted in euro. In addition, the Northern European Division is active across Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland and conducts business in several currencies. Our business is therefore sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, especially euro to pound sterling exchange rates. The presentation of our results of operations may be affected by the translation of foreign currencies into pound sterling for the purpose of our consolidated financial statements. We do not currently hedge any of our foreign exchange risks. Consequently, to the extent that foreign exchange rate exposures are not hedged, fluctuations in currencies may adversely affect our financial results in ways unrelated to our operations. For example, decreases in the value of the pound sterling relative to the euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona or Norwegian krone may have a positive impact on the results of operations presented in our consolidated financial reports solely due to the effects of translating the results of operations from our DACH Division and the Northern European Division from euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone into pound sterling. A positive impact on the results of operations presented in our consolidated financial reports due to decreases in the value of pounds sterling relative to the euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona or Norwegian krone may overstate the underlying performance and results of operations of our business or suggest an improvement in the performance and results of operations of our business when, after adjusting for the effects of currency translations, no such improvement has occurred or a deterioration has occurred. Conversely, increases in the value of the pound sterling relative to the euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona or Norwegian krone may have a negative impact on the results of operations presented in our consolidated financial reports solely due to the effects of translating the results of operations from our DACH Division and the Northern European Division from euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone into pound sterling. A negative impact on the results of operations presented in our consolidated financial reports due to increases in the value of pounds sterling relative to the euro, Danish krone, Swedish krona or Norwegian krone may understate the underlying performance and results of operations of our business or suggest a deterioration in the performance and results of operations of our business when, after adjusting for the effects of currency translations, no such deterioration has occurred or an improvement has occurred. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, if we were to use any hedging transactions in the future in the form of derivative financial instruments, such transactions may result in market-to-market losses and may prove to be ineffective. The realization of any of these risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees or cause the market price of the Notes to decline.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Accordingly, there may be times when a number of portfolios, or particularly large portfolios, are available for purchase at similar times, which may prevent us, due to restrictions in our funding ability, from pursuing all of the then available debt purchase opportunities. As a result, we may fail to maintain our market share. The inconsistency in the availability of debt portfolios for purchase may mean that during certain financial reporting periods we may make few or no purchases of debt portfolios. In addition, large purchases at the end of a financial period would likely have a material and adverse effect on our reported financial ratios. See _“Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of the Group’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_ It is not unusual to experience a gap between the time of acquisition of a debt portfolio and the time that we begin earning returns on the acquired portfolio as we need to locate consumers, build a consolidated profile of each such consumer’s circumstances and formulate an appropriate repayment solution before we can start to collect on an acquired portfolio. As a result, we may experience uneven cash flows and delays in generating ----- income from purchased loan portfolios. For example, if we were to acquire a material portfolio at the end of a reporting period, then this would increase our net debt or reduce our cash on hand without generating cash or contributing to Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA for the relevant period.

If our consumers experience a reduced ability to pay their debt, debt collection agencies may require higher commissions to address increased collection activity costs, and we could face higher payment plan default rates and lower average payments, any of which could reduce our cash generation or prolong the time required to collect cash, and reduce our return on capital and on ERC. Even if we are able to develop payment plans in relation to certain of these obligations, such measures may prove unsuccessful. Furthermore, we could more quickly reach a point of saturation with certain consumers (i.e., the number of accounts matched to a consumer may reach a point at which that consumer lacks the financial means to pay on all of the accounts that we own).

We may enter into interest rate hedges in the future, and at such time we may be subject to the risk of changes in interest rates and their impact on our derivative instruments. We may use interest rate swaps to hedge the effect of changes in the interest rate on our profit and loss. We may further hedge parts of our cash-flow risk that arises out of variable interest agreements on the refinancing side. We may enter into a derivative contract by paying fixed interest payments in exchange for receiving floating rate interest payments. When interest rates rise, our unhedged floating rate and new financing costs rise (to the extent we are party to relevant instruments), thereby reducing our profit or increasing our loss, but we may also receive higher interest income from our derivative instruments, which would offset (to the extent of such increase in income) the decline in profit or increase in loss from the rise in financing costs. Conversely, when interest rates decline, our unhedged floating rate and new financing costs decline (to the extent we are party to relevant instruments), thereby increasing our profit or decreasing our loss, but our interest income from any of our derivative instruments would decline, thus offsetting (to the extent of such decrease in income) any changes to profit and loss due to interest rate movements. At such time as we enter into hedges, we will be subject to the risk that there is a mismatch either between the interest swap performance and the change in the underlying funding cost that the derivative instruments are structured to hedge. We may also be exposed to the risk that our hedges could be implemented or priced incorrectly. Volatility in interest rates could impact valuation of interest rate swaps and therefore impair our ability to enter into these contracts on terms that enable us to achieve the hedging we need. If interest rates turn negative, our derivative instruments (to the extent we are party to such instruments) would not achieve our hedging needs. In addition to paying fixed interest payments, a negative interest rate would increase our interest payment instead of our receiving a floating rate interest payment in return. Furthermore, our derivative contracts (to the extent we are party to such contracts) may be subject to termination or break clauses, which may force us to renegotiate or replace those contracts on unattractive terms. Any of these events could cause losses and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We may also face delays or difficulties in implementing process and system improvements, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully compete in our core markets.

Our UK Division’s tax returns are prepared in accordance with UK tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions taken by our UK Division are based on industry practice, tax advice and drawing similarities from our facts and circumstances to those in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, value added, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base and apportionment. Challenges made by tax authorities to our UK Division’s application of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations. In addition, we are exposed to potential tax risks related to acquisitions, disposals and reorganizations, if our position with regard to the tax consequences of the acquisitions, disposals and reorganizations is challenged in a tax audit. Furthermore, our UK Division’s effective tax rate in a given financial year reflects a variety of factors that may not be present in the succeeding financial year or years. One such factor affecting this effective tax rate is the relevant standard rate of corporation tax assessed against our UK Division, which is subject to change. This rate is currently 19% as of April 2020. In addition, changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretation of tax laws by the courts or the tax authorities including those tax laws relating to the utilization of tax loss or credit carry forwards, and changes in our assessment of certain matters, such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets or claim tax deductions for interest on intragroup loans, may also have a material adverse effect on our business.

Ongoing tax audits for the DACH Division, which comprise, for most DACH Division companies, the period up to and including the financial year ended December 31, 2016, tax audits for later periods not yet subject to a tax audit or tax audits in other countries may lead to higher tax assessments in the future. For example, the DACH Division operates a number of tax groups (Organschaften) in Germany and these tax structures may be challenged in future tax audits. Non-recognition of our tax groups by the German tax authorities could lead to additional tax liabilities. In connection with the last tax audits of Tesch, part of the interest on shareholder loans was considered as a constructive dividend by the tax authorities resulting in an additional suspended corporate income tax, trade tax and withholding tax of approximately €0.8 million (whereby approximately €0.67 million is covered by a contractual indemnity claim).

The Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 then amended the ATAD I with respect to hybrid mismatches with third countries (the “ATAD II”). On December 21, 2018, Luxembourg enacted a law (the “ATAD I Law”) transposing the ATAD I into Luxembourg legislation. The ATAD I Law may have an impact on the tax position and the performance of the Issuer. Amongst the measures contained in the ATAD I Law is an interest deductibility limitation rule. The ATAD I Law provides that “exceeding borrowing costs” in excess of the higher of (a) €3,000,000 or (b) 30% of an entity’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward over the five subsequent financial years. ----- “Exceeding borrowing costs” is a defined term which relates to the amount by which the tax-deductible borrowing costs exceed “interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues.” Furthermore, the Luxembourg law dated December 20, 2019 (the “ATAD II Law”) transposed the ATAD II into Luxembourg legislation. With respect to situations of double deductions or deductions without inclusion resulting from hybrid mismatches, the ATAD II Law extends the scope of the ATAD I Law to third countries. The ATAD II requires EU Member States to either deny deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in case of hybrid mismatches. It includes situations involving permanent establishments, reverse hybrids, imported mismatches, hybrid transfers and dual residence. The ATAD II Law applies as of January 1, 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches which will apply as of January 1, 2022.

Norwegian GAAP differs in certain respects from IFRS. For example, under Norwegian GAAP, actuarial gains and losses related to pension schemes need not be recognized in the income statement, and the obligation and expense for the period will be different from the figures under IFRS. The financial assumptions with regards to unrecognized actuarial gains and losses under Norwegian GAAP and IFRS may also differ.

If the UK and the European Union are unable to negotiate an acceptable ongoing trade ----- deal at the end of the Transition Period, this could have an impact on the general and economic conditions in the UK, which will directly adversely affect the financial condition of our consumers. As no member state of the EU has previously chosen to leave the EU, the legal and political process for doing so is untried and uncertain. There are a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the UK and its relationship with the EU and the negotiation of Brexit-related matters may take several years. Given this uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes, it is currently impossible to determine the impact that Brexit and the nature and extent of government responses in the formulation of fiscal and monetary policies, and/or any related matters may have on general economic conditions in the UK. It is also not possible to determine the impact that these matters will have on our business. In addition, the instability could be further exacerbated by a push for independence by Scotland and/or Northern Ireland.

In 2003, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) decided that the purchase of receivables for a subsequent cash collection (factoring) is to be treated as a supply of a taxable service from the purchaser to the seller (C-305/01, MKG). The seller would be relieved from the collection of the receivables as well as from the risk of (final) payment default. The ECJ decision was also adopted by the German tax authorities for the purchases of NPLs (old version of Section 2.4 para. 1 and para. 8 German VAT Guidelines, “UStAE”). On October 27, 2011, the ECJ decided that acquisitions of NPLs are not subject to VAT (C93/10, GFKL). This court decision was adopted by the German Federal Tax Court (“BFH”) in a decision dated January 26, 2012 (V R 18/08). The BFH decision also said that no input VAT could be claimed on costs incurred in connection with NPLs acquisitions as well as on costs incurred in connection with the collection of the receivables, and referred back to the local Tax Court Düsseldorf. Our DACH Division has since withdrawn its initial lawsuit. Consequently the cases are not binding on our DACH Division. These court cases as well as another comparable case (BFH decision dated July 4, 2013 (V R 8/10)) have been adopted by the German tax authorities in a tax decree issued by the German Federal Ministry of Finance dated December 2, 2015 and in updated VAT Guidelines (Section 2.4 para. 1, para. 7 and para. 8 German VAT Guidelines). ----- The VAT Guidelines include the possibility to apply for previous guidance from the German tax authorities with respect to NPLs acquired before July 1, 2016 or, in the case of revolving contracts, before January 1, 2019, i.e., that the purchase of NPLs still qualifies as a VAT-taxable service allowing for the deduction of input VAT for the respective historical periods.

In addition, we report our financial results for the Group in pound sterling. Accordingly, we must translate our euro-denominated indebtedness into poundequivalent amounts in order to prepare our quarterly and yearly financial reports, and further declines in the value of the pound relative to the euro may increase the pound sterling-denominated value of the debt we disclose in these reports.

Governments and regulators have implemented austerity programs and other remedial measures to respond to this issue and stabilize the financial system, but the actual impact of such programs and measures are difficult to predict.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, providers of certain additional super senior indebtedness, certain hedging obligations, the Security Agent, any receiver and certain creditor representatives, including the Trustee, are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale and all amounts received by the Security Agent pursuant to the turnover provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the aggregate of the then outstanding claims under super senior indebtedness are greater than or equal to the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor and all amounts received by the Security Agent pursuant to the turnover provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will, after all obligations under super senior indebtedness have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with the Notes and certain non-priority hedging obligations. ----- The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, which will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the hedging obligations which are permitted to be secured on the Collateral, the holders of the Existing Notes, the holders of the Notes and the creditors of any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents. The Intercreditor Agreement also regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group (as defined below under—”Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises (i) creditors holding in aggregate_ more than 66[2]/3% of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the aggregate commitments under any super senior Credit Facility and the aggregate of hedging exposures under certain priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and (ii) creditors holding in aggregate more than 50% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the outstanding principal amount of any indebtedness ranking _pari passu with the Notes (the “Majority Senior Secured",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

As such, each Note Guarantee will be effectively subordinated to any super senior indebtedness (including obligations with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In the event of any enforcement over Collateral that secures the Notes and pursuant to certain other turnover provisions under the Intercreditor Agreement, holders of super senior indebtedness will have prior claims to such Collateral. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, if, for any reason, obligations owed to any super senior and senior secured creditors remain unpaid after enforcement of the Collateral and the resulting losses are not borne by the super senior creditors and the senior secured creditors in the proportion corresponding to the total liabilities owed to the super senior creditors and the senior secured creditors, respectively, then the applicable creditors will be required to make payments among themselves to achieve the appropriate proportion in accordance with the order of priority contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement.

As a result, the holders of the Notes may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement of the pledges of the shares in the Issuer or the Guarantors.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests granted in favor of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral in certain jurisdictions. For example, under Luxembourg and German law, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure on, such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, T-Shares in certain of our subsidiaries are held by Garfunkelux PBA S.à r.l., which is not a subsidiary of the Issuer or the Parent. To obtain control of 100% of the share capital of or instruments issued by entities that have transferred or issued T-Shares to Garfunkelux PBA S.à r.l., the Security Agent would be required to enforce such pledges of T-Shares separately from the pledges provided by the Issuer over the shares of Lowell Holding GmbH and Simon Holdco Limited, which are the direct and indirect parent entities of the remaining Group entities. Likewise, the Security Agent would be required to enforce the pledge over Garfunkelux PBA S.à r.l.’s T-Share in the Issuer separately from the pledge provided by the Parent over its shares in the Issuer. Enforcement of multiple security documents could cause delays, increase costs and hinder the holders of the Notes’ ability to derive full benefit from the applicable Collateral. In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the operation of the business or the sale of particular assets, including for example the sale of accounts receivable into a securitization program, could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the,13.10.3,The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. The granting of security interests in favor of a foreign security agent (acting for and on behalf of thirdparty beneficiaries) will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the designation of such security agent is valid under the law governing its appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending on the type of the security interests granted. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005, a security interest which constitutes a financial collateral arrangement (in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005) may be provided in favor of a person acting for and on behalf of the beneficiary(ies) of such security interest(s), a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third-party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security interest(s), the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security interest(s) provided under the Financial Collateral Law 2005. ----- In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions, as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including, among others, Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the applicable Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested in the courts of these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Note Guarantees. Finally, the provision of Note Guarantees and execution of the Collateral will be subject to certain agreed security principles that could relieve certain Guarantors or security providers of the obligation to provide guarantees and/or grant security interests in assets otherwise expected to form part of the Collateral, which could have a material adverse impact on the credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements.

In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, ----- which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the FCA announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale Policy at the FCA on January 28, 2019 indicate that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis (or at all) cannot and will not be guaranteed, and market participants should not rely on its publication, after 2021. In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the working group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Hansa Notes and the Floating Rate Euro Notes, interest rates of which are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). The discontinuation of EURIBOR or LIBOR or changes to its administration could require changes to the way in which the interest payments on the Floating Rate Euro Notes are calculated. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and return on, the Floating Rate Euro Notes. In addition, the development of alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR may result in the Floating Rate Euro Notes performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR had not developed. The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, the Issuer could, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, determine an appropriate successor rate, and make certain adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to make such successor rate comparable to EURIBOR, which upon certification (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) by the Issuer of such rate to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent will be used to calculate the interest rate in relation to the Floating Rate Euro Notes (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever) without any further action or consent by the noteholders or the Trustee. This means that interest on the Floating Rate Euro Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Floating Rate Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The definition of “covered fund” in the Volcker Rule includes, among other things, any entity that would be an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act but for the exclusion provided under Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer and each of the Guarantors relies on Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment Company Act for their exclusion from registration thereunder (which limits sales of the Notes to “qualified purchasers” as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act), they will be considered “covered funds” for purposes of the Volcker Rule in the absence of an exclusion from the definition of “covered fund.” Accordingly, “banking entities” (as defined under the Volcker Rule) that are subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited under the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or any of the Guarantors as a “covered fund,” in the absence of an applicable exclusion from the definition of “covered fund” or exemption under the Volcker Rule. Depending on market conditions, this could significantly and negatively affect the liquidity and market value of the Notes and the Note Guarantees. “Ownership interest” is broadly defined under the Volcker Rule to include any equity, partnership or other similar interest, and the phrase “other similar interest” is further defined to include, in part, any participation or other interest that entitles the holder of such interest to, amongst other things: (a) participate in the selection or removal of management or otherwise (other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of default or acceleration event and to participate in the removal of an investment manager for “cause” (as defined therein) or in the selection of a replacement manager upon an investment manager’s resignation or removal), (b) share in the income, gains or profits of the “covered fund”, (c) receive underlying assets of the “covered fund” after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of default or acceleration event), (d) receive all or a portion of excess spread (as defined therein), (e) provide under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the “covered fund with respect to the interest can be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the “covered fund”, (f) receive income on a pass-through basis from the “covered fund” or have a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the “covered fund”, or (g) any synthetic right to have, receive or be allocated any of the rights in clauses (a) through (f) above. On June 25, 2020, the relevant federal regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule released a final rule to amend certain parts of the Volcker Rule’s covered fund related restrictions. The changes are intended to improve and streamline certain aspects of the “covered funds” portion of the Volcker Rule, including by, among other aspects, making modifications to certain existing exclusions from the definition of “covered fund,” creating certain new exclusions from the definition of “covered fund,” and making certain clarifications to the definition of “ownership interest.” The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. ----- The Volcker Rule may restrict or discourage the acquisition of Notes and the Note Guarantees by “banking entities” and may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Ownership in respect of shares (and by extension also debt securities, such as the Notes) which are issued by a Luxembourg company in registered form is, according to the Companies Law 1915, established by the relevant registration (inscription) in the register thereof kept at the relevant Luxembourg company’s registered office—in this instance, the Issuer Register. The Registrar will undertake, pursuant to the Indenture, to notify the Issuer forthwith of any changes made to the Register to enable it to update its Issuer Register.

See _“Description of the Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest— _Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.” It is generally held that the registrations made in the Issuer Register_ would constitute a means to prove ownership in respect of the Notes. However, Luxembourg case law appears to admit that such registrations in the Issuer Register do not create an irrebuttable presumption (présomption _irréfragable) of title to the Notes and indicates that other forms of evidence (such as the registrations made in the_ Register) could potentially also serve as means to prove ownership. As a result, there can be no assurance that, in the event of discrepancies between the Register and the Issuer Register, a Luxembourg court will not take into account the Register and its contents if the question of the ownership of the Notes is brought before it and rule that the Register prevails over the Issuer Register.

Depreciation of the euro or pound sterling against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments ----- could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars by U.S. holders (as defined under “Taxation—Certain _U.S._ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_ _Considerations”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any.

The directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are all non-residents of the United States, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Germany, Luxembourg, England and Wales, Jersey, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Germany, Luxembourg, England and Wales, Jersey, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Germany, Luxembourg, England and Wales, Jersey, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in Germany, Luxembourg, England and Wales, Jersey, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations.

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,3215,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE GROUP’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,3215.1,Overview,3215.1.1,,"The Group is one of the largest Credit Management Services (“CMS”) providers in Europe, by revenue and ERC in the debt purchasing business and by third-party debt under management in the third-party collection ----- services business. We believe that the business benefits from scale and diversification in terms of broad geographic reach and balanced revenue mix, together with a complementary and client-focused product offering. Furthermore, our expertise, management and financial resources provide the Group with excellent opportunities to drive further growth and diversification in a highly developed, data-rich credit market. These growth prospects are supported by our clear core competencies: (i) longstanding and multifaceted client relationships built on differentiated strategies for originating new business; (ii) a broad business model that is diversified across product offerings, markets and sectors; (iii) a strong track record of return on capital and reliable portfolio pricing; (iv) strong cash-generation capability featuring high predictability and visibility into future cash flows; and (v) a robust and improving governance framework with a focus on reputation and compliance that we believe is embedded in our operational activity. We provide a range of credit management services across the UK, DACH (collectively, Germany, Austria and Switzerland) and Northern Europe (collectively, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) to a broad client base that includes some of the largest credit providers in Europe. The principal activity of the Group is: the acquisition and collection of non-performing, generally unsecured, consumer debt portfolios (“DP”); and the provision of third party contingent collection (“3PC”) services. 3PC services include debt servicing offerings such as early stage collections, business process outsourcing, contingent collections, trace services and litigation activities. We operate 3PC services primarily in Germany, Austria and Northern Europe. The Group is very well regarded within the industry, a reputation that is further supported by the Group’s key strategic themes of strong customer focus and risk management. Best practices relating to our sophisticated pricing, decision science and cost-optimization experience are continuously shared across our business and make the Group a trusted partner to credit originators and consumers alike. Our Group generated total income of £746.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £657.1 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated operating profit of £150.5 million, Group cash income of £949.6 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of £496.0 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated operating profit of £112.0 million, Group cash income of £930.3 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of £512.7 million (£280.9 million in our UK Division, £101.4 million in our DACH Division and £133.2 million in our Northern European Division, net of £2.7 million of Group costs). As of June 30, 2020, our Gross Money Multiple was 2.6x in the UK Division, 3.2x in the DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division and we had £13.2 billion (as of December 31, 2019: £12.4 billion) of third-party debt under management. We believe that we are a more diversified business than ever before, with a scaled pan-European presence and a range of services on offer that compares favorably to peers. Our ability to provide a full range of services across the CMS value chain helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectable data, which in turn supports the development of tailored collection strategies and analytical capabilities to more accurately price portfolios. Operating with a balanced business model across Europe also enables us to allocate resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the opportunities that are most attractive. Furthermore, the acquisition of the Northern European Division in 2018 has enabled the Group to provide clients with an enhanced range of value-added services before loans and receivables are overdue. These include invoicing, in which the client can outsource its CMS to the Northern European Division, and ability to offer consumers payment through invoice or part payment solutions and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information. These solutions have enabled us to access a wider breadth of credit active customers earlier in the value chain, before the delinquency phase. As the Group continues to develop, we expect to further capitalize on the Group’s strengths by: (i) delivering a multi-product, multi-service and pan-regional offering while maintaining clear pricing discipline; (ii) establishing an industry benchmark for operational excellence through investments in its one-stop service offering; (iii) maintaining a reputation for pioneering insights by continuously improving its IT, data and collection platforms through innovations and investment; (iv) continuing to take a best practices approach to its client relationships and (v) continuing to invest in its employees and corporate culture. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

As a result, the relative significance of individual debt ----- originators changes from year to year. We also seek to adopt a diversified purchase strategy and as a result purchased debt portfolios with a purchase price of at least £100,000 from 27 vendors in our UK Division and debt portfolios with a purchase price of at least €100,000 from 30 vendors in our DACH Division and 31 vendors in our Northern European Division, in each case in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, our UK Division’s Backbook was made up of approximately 15.8 million active accounts and 2,473 owned debt portfolios, 66% of which cost less than £0.5 million, with the 30 largest owned debt portfolios comprising 13% of ERC. Our UK Division’s owned debt portfolios are also diversified across primarily three different sectors, with 52% originated in the financial services sector, 24% in the retail sector and 20% in the telecommunications sector (for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and based on portfolio purchases). As of June 30, 2020, our DACH Division’s Backbook was made up of approximately 4.1 million active accounts and 562 owned debt portfolios, 85% of which cost less than €0.5 million, with the 30 largest owned debt portfolio purchases comprising 10% of ERC. Our DACH Division owned debt portfolios are primarily diversified across four different sectors, with 58% originated in the financial services section, 2% in the retail sector, 2% in the telecommunications sector and 7% in the fitness sector with the remaining 31% in other sectors such as utilities, public services, leisure and tourism (for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and based on portfolio purchases). As of June 30, 2020, our Northern European Division’s Backbook was made up of approximately 2.3 million active accounts and 1,246 owned debt portfolios, 79% of which cost less than €0.5 million, with the 30 largest owned debt portfolio purchases comprising 10% of ERC. Our Northern European Division owned debt portfolios are primarily diversified across two different sectors, with 91% originated in the financial services section, 8% in the retail sector with the remaining 1% in other sectors such as utilities (for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and based on portfolio purchases). There are two principal models for purchasing portfolios of debt: spot sale agreements and forward flow agreements. In a spot sale, we agree to buy a portfolio of claims that we receive in one transaction upon payment. In our DACH Division, spot sales are mostly conducted through auctions, especially in the financial services sector, while in our UK Division, spot sales are mostly conducted through sealed bids, and in our Northern European Division, sales are conducted through competitive tender processes. In a forward flow agreement, we agree to buy claims with predetermined characteristics at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume from a client on an ongoing basis. See “Our Group’s Business—Debt Purchase—Debt Portfolio Purchase—Types _of Debt Purchase Agreements.” In the period from our UK Division’s Start Date (June 1, 2004) to June 30, 2020,_ 43% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements or agreements that were a mixture of a forward flow agreement with a spot purchase, representing £845.8 million in portfolio purchases. In the period from our DACH Division’s Start Date (September 30, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 48% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements, representing €320.1 million in portfolio purchases. In the period from our Northern European Division’s Start Date (January 1, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 31% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements, representing €361.4 million in portfolio purchases. We believe our ability to secure and renew forward flow agreements is a key driver of our performance as these increase client retention and thereby provide greater earnings visibility. As of June 30, 2020, our UK Division’s cumulative portfolio purchases were £1,974.0 million, its cumulative active accounts were approximately 15.8 million and the aggregate face value at time of purchase of its owned debt portfolios was £23.5 billion.

These projections were prepared for illustrative purposes only and are different from the forecasts we use to calculate the carrying amount of the Group’s owned debt portfolios as recognized in the Group Consolidated Financial Statements. We calculate ERC using data derived from our databases of owned and service debt portfolio in the markets in which we operate, proprietary behavioral and asset valuation models and specialist local input. We synthesize these inputs to create collection forecasts over a 120-month period, with respect to the Group and our UK Division, and a 180-month period, with respect to our DACH and Northern European Divisions. Our DACH and Northern European Divisions calculate ERC on a 180-month basis because debt collection claims are subject to longer statutes of limitation in those regions, and we therefore expect to be able to achieve collections on owned debt portfolios over a longer period. References to our ERC in this Offering Memorandum are references to gross ERC (which includes estimated collections in respect of principal balance, costs, service costs and fees). ERC calculations are often used by other companies to present collections estimates covering collection periods comparable throughout the CMS industry even though ERC might be calculated differently in detail. We believe that our 120M ERC represents an important supplemental measure to compare our cash generating capacity with other companies in the CMS industry, even though we can provide no assurance that we will achieve such collections within the specified time period, or at all. In order to assess our cash generation, we calculate our Group Replacement Rate, which we use as a proxy amount of capital required to maintain our Group ERC (the sum of our UK Division’s 120-month ERC and our DACH and Northern European Divisions’ 180-month ERC) at a specific point in time. Our Group Replacement Rate takes into account our expected reduction in ERC over the coming year by deducting year-one expected collections from our Group ERC and adding the collections that currently sit outside each division’s ERC horizon, being collections expected in months 121-132 for the UK Division and months 181-192 for the DACH and Northern European Divisions. This provides our hypothetical Group ERC in twelve months’ time if we make no portfolio purchases during the period. We then use our current trading Gross Money Multiples to calculate our end-of period replacement rate, which is the implied amount of portfolio purchases that would be required to make up the difference between our actual Group ERC and our hypothetical Group ERC after a year without any portfolio purchases. We average the end-of-period replacement rate with that of the prior period to determine our in-year Group ERC Replacement Rate.

The purchase price of a debt portfolio is the value at which it was initially recorded on our or our predecessor’s consolidated balance sheet, as applicable, at the time of purchase. (2) The face value of an owned debt portfolio means the nominal value of receivables and includes any accrued interest, fees and costs applied by the originator at the time of purchase. Face value at time of purchase represents the face value of the debt portfolio at the time we acquired it, and may include the face value of accounts that have since settled, closed or otherwise become inactive. See “Presentation _of Financial and Other Information—Non-Financial Operating Data.”_ (3) Portfolio purchases as a percentage of the face value of owned debt portfolios acquired per annum is generally not comparable on a yearto-year basis. This is due to the varying characteristics of the owned debt portfolios acquired, such as the type, size, quality, industry and maturity profile, each of which can have a direct impact on the pricing of such portfolios. For example, if in a given year, the owned debt portfolios acquired primarily comprise debt portfolios of fresher claims with a higher probability to pay, then our portfolio purchases as a percentage of face value in that period may be higher than a prior or subsequent period, independent of any general market trends in overall pricing. Our performance is dependent on our ability to purchase debt portfolios across all sectors that meet our minimum return criteria, which in turn is driven by the volume of debt made available for sale by debt originators and vendors, competitive dynamics and our ability to price portfolios accurately. The volume of debt portfolios sold each year comes from (i) the book of defaulted debt in that year and (ii) the backlog of debt defaulted in prior years that remains unsold. The pricing of debt portfolios also affects the volume of debt portfolios sold each year, as it determines whether it is more economically attractive for a vendor to sell the debt or to warehouse it for further in-house or outsourced collections. Competition also affects our ability to purchase portfolios. The majority of portfolios across all sectors are currently offered to the market through spot sales conducted through a competitive tender process. In recent years, we believe that there has been a trend towards increased concentration of the debt purchase industry around a small core group of purchasers. It is possible that there will be new entrants or companies re-entering the debt purchase market. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We are active in competitive _markets and may be unable to continue to successfully compete with businesses that may offer more attractive prices or have greater financial resources, less expensive funding or lower return requirements than we have.”_ We typically compete with one or two of these debt purchasers in the last stages of debt auctions. We compete mainly on the basis of price and compliance credentials. Pricing on portfolio purchases for both of our divisions is conducted at the Group level. See “Our Group’s Business—Debt Purchase.” ----- While most of the debt portfolios are sold through competitive tender processes in spot sales, we have many long-standing relationships that have helped improve our portfolio-purchasing ability. For example, 87% of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 were purchased from clients with which we have held a relationship for 5 years or more. We also purchase portfolios by entering into forward flow agreements, whereby we agree to purchase all or substantially all of the debt originator’s debt sales, generally through a bilateral sale, subject to the debt originator’s compliance with pre-agreed criteria. Since inception to June 30, 2020, 43% of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases, 48% of our DACH Division’s portfolio purchases and 31% of our Northern European Division’s portfolio purchases were made pursuant to such forward flow agreements or agreements that were a mixture of a forward flow agreement with a spot purchase. The ability to purchase debt portfolios is also dependent on access to financing. Should we lose access to financing, we may not be able to make new acquisitions of debt portfolios.

In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 43% of our gross collections came from Gross Debt Purchase Collections and the remaining 57% came from third-party collection services. The majority of our paying consumers make their payments through long-term, low-installment plans. These installment plans typically see payments being made through automated and predictable methods such as direct debit. The amount a consumer pays generally varies depending on the portion of the consumer’s disposable income available to rectify his or her financial situation. We believe in offering our consumers the choice of clearing their outstanding balances through practical, affordable and personalized monthly installments in addition to one-off settlements. Our collections performance is therefore assisted by our ability to build, using our internal data intelligence systems, a detailed and dynamic understanding of our consumers’ circumstances. Since the financial year ended 2004, our UK Division has demonstrated collections growth each year. From the financial year ended August 31, 2007 to the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, it has grown its twelvemonth Gross Debt Purchase Collections from £50.8 million to £443.7 million, and despite the changing economic environment, actual collections closely followed the collection forecasts made before the financial crisis. From its Start Date (June 1, 2004) to June 30, 2020, our UK Division achieved Gross Debt Purchase Collections of £3,014.4 million and, as of June 30, 2020, its owned debt portfolios had a 120-month ERC of £2,069.0 million, generating a Gross Money Multiple of 2.6x on a cumulative basis. Our DACH Division also, generally, has a strong track record in outperforming its initial collection forecasts on the portfolios purchased. From its Start Date (September 30, 2003) to June 30, 2020, our DACH Division achieved Gross Debt Purchase Collections of €1,392.9 million and, as of June 30, 2020, its owned debt portfolios had a 180-month ERC of €702.1 million, generating a Gross Money Multiple of 3.2x on a cumulative basis. Our Northern European Division also, generally, has a strong track record in outperforming its initial collection forecasts on the portfolios purchased. From its Start Date (January 1, 2003) to June 30, 2020, our Northern European Division achieved Gross Debt Purchase Collections of €1,905.3 million and, as of June 30, 2020, its owned debt portfolios had a 180-month ERC of €1,101.8 million, generating a Gross Money Multiple of 2.5x on a cumulative basis. ----- Management believes the historical resilience of its collections in this period of weak economic conditions was supported by: - **_Low average payments and account diversification. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our UK Division received on average 2.0 million unique payments per month, with an average monthly payment of £18.19. In the DACH Division during the same period, we received on average 0.45 million unique payments per month, with an average monthly payment of €94.37. In the Northern European Division during the same period, we received on average 0.33 million unique payments per month, with an average monthly payment of €118.51. As of June 30, 2020, the average account balance in our UK Division’s owned debt portfolios was £702.57, the average account balance in our DACH Division’s owned debt portfolios was €934.37, the average account balance in our DACH Division’s 3PC serviced portfolios was €1,945.80, the average account balance in our Northern European Division’s owned debt portfolios was €2,330.14 and the average account balance in our Northern European Division’s 3PC serviced portfolios was €1,886.74. We believe that our low average monthly payments and the fact that our consumers are typically already in financial distress or unemployed have provided some degree of protection against changes in our consumers’ disposable income. - **_Predictable collections from recurring payment methods. Of our £455.4 million of UK Division Gross Debt Purchase Collections in the year ended December 31, 2019, 89% came from existing accounts already owned as of December 31, 2018 and 79% were paid pursuant to payment plans. Across our UK Division’s Backbook, as of December 31, 2019, the majority of our monthly collections came from recurring payments, such as direct debits and continuous payment authorizations on debit and credit cards. Of our €178.0 million of DACH Division Gross Debt Purchase Collections in the year ended December 31, 2019, 74% came from existing portfolios already owned as of December 31, 2018. Of our €192.6 million of Northern European Division Gross Debt Purchase Collections in the year ended December 31, 2019, 90% came from existing portfolios already owned as of December 31, 2018. - **_Close performance monitoring and sophisticated data mining capabilities. By tracking the financial circumstances of individual consumers, we have been able to proactively adjust consumers’ payment plans in a way we believe optimizes returns. Our UK Division’s default rate among its paying consumers decreased from 6.63% to 5.33% between June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020, calculated as the percentage of payment plans which made no payments in the month a payment was due, based on a six-month average. Our DACH Division’s default rate decreased from 18.0% to 11.0% between June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020, calculated as the percentage over a six-month period of collections compared to expected collections, which were derived by the last six months of agreed payments. We believe this approach both helps our consumers meet their obligations and helps us to reach our return targets. However, we may not always be able to adjust in such a way in the future.

Our debt collection process is standardized and highly automated, with the goal of maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt. We endeavor to foster payment solutions, such as bespoke repayment plans, that provide visibility on the cash collected and minimize default risk for consumers. Our approach to collections is focused on delivering the highest net return on capital by optimizing costs versus collection potential. Historically, for example, from our UK Division’s inception through June 30, 2020, in our UK Division we have only needed to collect from 29% of our consumer accounts in order to achieve our returns. To deliver our targeted returns on investments, we use collection strategies to decide the level of resources to deploy on each account. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on our consumers’ ability and willingness to pay, which allows us to develop tailored collection strategies to optimize servicing efficiency and return on capital. For example, the ability to segment our DACH Division accounts, using internally developed scorecards, allows us to locate those accounts which are most able and/or likely to pay and simultaneously will increase our collection rates and optimize our costs. We are also focused on controlling our overhead through reducing our discretionary spending. Year-on-year and other period-on-period trends in our collection cost percentages are not necessarily indicative of our operational efficiency and the return on capital we can achieve on our owned debt portfolios, as they are impacted by the varying characteristics of the portfolios we purchase in different years and differences in the timing of portfolio acquisitions during the year. Specifically, we believe that recent trends in our collection cost ratio have been driven by: (i) the characteristics of the owned debt portfolio (i.e., the industry or specific contractual arrangement of the debt); (ii) significant improvements in the operational efficiency of our collections team, primarily due to our implementation of a more automated and centralized debt collection function; and (iii) changes in the volume of claims and other outstanding debt collected which can vary in any given period based on a number of factors outside of our control, such as the general macroeconomic condition in the UK, DACH and Northern Europe. See “—Economic Conditions.” In the DACH Division, we have systematically carried out projects that have had, and that we believe will continue to have, a positive effect on our operations. We have divested a number of non-core activities and smaller businesses during the periods under review. In addition to making strategic divestitures, we have made strategic DACH-region acquisitions to complement our collections processes, such as the acquisition of DMA in 2014, a data solution provider that sources information from more than 15 data information companies via a ----- central platform. The acquisition of DMA has afforded our decision science team a competitive advantage by providing them a multi-sourcing data information tool as well as unique data products leveraging best-of-breed data sources, and our DACH-region business has improved its collection processes by implementing internal initiatives such as our service center, which is a centralized automated hub for managing mail and processing millions of incoming and outgoing letters annually. In addition, we have further enhanced our one-stop CMS solution and our geographic footprint through our acquisitions of IS Inkasso Service, the Tesch Group and Apontas. In the Northern European Division, optimizing customer contact at each stage of the collection life cycle is the key to our debt collection strategy. Our debt collection process is standardized and automated, with the goal of maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach rather than exploiting shortterm collection potential. We benefit when purchasing a portfolio since any effects resulting from allocating additional resources and cost to collect to such portfolio is attributed to us, whereas in debt collection the additional resources and cost merely produce a marginal increase in commissions and in many cases require clients to accept a higher commission in order for us to benefit from the additional revenue generated. Debt purchasing does not require clients to take this risk, but clients can realize some of the benefit by receiving an attractive price level. Year-on-year trends in the Northern European Division’s collection cost ratio are not necessarily indicative of operational efficiency and the return on capital that can be achieved on purchased debt, as they are impacted by the varying characteristics of the portfolios we purchase in different years and differences in the timing of portfolio acquisitions during the year. Specifically, we believe that recent trends in collection cost ratios have been driven by: (i) significant improvements in the operational efficiency of our collections team, primarily due to the implementation of more efficient collection methods, such as text messages and other automated processes, and a well-balanced level of operating expenses; and (ii) changes in the volume, mix and timing of portfolio acquisitions in each year. Operational efficiency is key to the Northern European Division’s business model and a main advantage of its business compared to competitors and financial institutions and other customer companies that handle their debt collection in-house. We begin the debt collection process by segmenting or scoring customers according to the predicted likelihood that they will pay, based on criteria such as past payment history, size and type of debt, customer’s age and gender and whether the debt was incurred by a consumer or a business. Thereafter, we determine which collection method to use for the specific claim, such as calls, letters, text messages, and emails, depending on various factors, including the geographical market, the claim size, the client we are acting on behalf of, the applicable laws and regulations and the individual customer. We believe the Northern European Division is able to lower collection costs due to its large scale and automation of the debt collection process and the Northern European Division is able to increase recovery rates through its data assets and analytical capabilities to optimally tailor debt collection strategies based on past experiences. As a result, we believe that the Northern European Division can optimize collection efficiency over the lifetime of the claim. In addition, we have enhanced further enhanced our geographic footprint with the 2018 Acquisitions. Our Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA increased from £496.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to £512.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Our operating profit decreased from £150.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to £112.0 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020.

In the period from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020, the twelve-month Gross Debt Purchase Collections per call center agent in our DACH Division grew from approximately €724,000 to €1,051,000, reflecting our ability to collect on our growing asset base over the period with increasing efficiency. In the period from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020, the twelve-month Gross Debt Purchase Collections per call center agent in our Northern European Division grew from approximately €811,000 to €966,000.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

We have detailed policies and procedures in place that are ----- designed to foster compliance with applicable law and to ensure that compliance issues, if any, are identified and appropriately elevated within the organization. Our policy regarding regulatory compliance defines, among other things, governing principles regarding identification of governing laws and regulations, delegation of compliance responsibilities, guidelines on education and competence, testing and documentation of regulatory compliance control measures. The regulatory environment for debt collection in the EU, the UK, and Norway requires considerable investment in processes, know-how and management. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, a significant amount of financial and technical resources in order to achieve and maintain compliance with these requirements. From September 30, 2013 to June 30, 2020 in the UK Division, for example, we have increased the number of FTEs in our compliance team from 43 to 103. In our UK, DACH and Northern Europe divisions, compliance systems and controls, as well as the training of employees, to increase awareness of regulatory requirements and policies are in place. We provide comprehensive training to employees on legal and regulatory compliance and require employees to complete a designated compliance module as well as regular interactive refreshers and tests.

We intend to participate opportunistically in a disciplined manner in the consolidation of the European CMS industry in order to build scale, address untapped consumer segments and create new relationships with debt originators. We intend to strategically pursue further carve-out transactions with current clients and small, credit-accretive bolt-on acquisitions. Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. First, our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our consolidated results. Because acquired businesses are included in our consolidation perimeter from the date of completion of each relevant acquisition, their full impact is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period. In addition, the results of the acquired businesses after their acquisition may be impacted positively by synergies. For larger strategic acquisitions, we may experience a temporary increase in investments and both operational and personnel expenses as we integrate the acquired business into our network. Because of changes in our corporate structure following a number of changes in ownership, we carry a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet (£1,226.9 million as of June 30, 2020). Goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually and whenever there are indications of impairment. We may record significant charges in our income statement in the event of impairment under IFRS. As a result of our acquisition accounting policies, our acquisition of entities that own debt portfolios may cause us to recognize fair value releases in subsequent financial statements which may affect our results.

The purchase price of a debt portfolio is the value at which it was initially recorded on our or our predecessor’s consolidated balance sheet, as applicable, at the time of purchase. (2) Face value at time of purchase represents the face value of the debt portfolio at the time we acquired it, and may include the face value of accounts that have since settled, closed or otherwise become inactive. ----- (3) Estimated Remaining Collections (ERC) is the future collections projected to be received on all of our Northern European Division’s owned debt portfolios based on our forecasting models. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our Northern European Division forecasts collections over a 180-month period. (4) Gross Money Multiple is the total expected cash return from owned debt portfolios calculated as the sum of cumulative Gross Debt Purchase Collections achieved by our Northern European Division through June 30, 2020 and our Northern European Division’s ERC, divided by cumulative portfolio purchases. The Gross Money Multiples for our Northern European Division’s early vintages are impacted by the business going through its initial growth cycle. Vintages during the financial crisis benefit from our Northern European Division’s leveraging of its growing data asset to enhance both pricing and operational capability and thereby drive increased collection performance. More recent vintages have primarily not had the benefit of time as these older vintages have, as Gross Money Multiple is based on collections to date. For more information on how we calculate ERC and Gross Money Multiples, see “Presentation of _Financial and Other Information—Non-Financial Operating Data.”_ In addition, the volume of receivables outsourced to us on behalf of debt originators, and consequently our revenue from third-party collections services is linked to our historical ability to collect on defaulted debt and on our relationships with our third-party collection services clients, particularly in the DACH Division, including our ability to demonstrate strong collection levels. Our third-party collection revenue is generated both by the fees we receive from originators as part of the successful recovery of defaulted debt, as well as the fees and additional interest we receive from consumers, including cost reimbursement, as prescribed by law. Our third-party collection services clients actively manage the outsourcing process. Depending on how well we perform, our clients may release more claims to us or, conversely, if we have performed poorly compared to our peer group, reduce the number of claims that we service. We offer flexible pricing arrangements to our third-party collection services clients that are tailored to the specific circumstances of the client and the relevant claims to be outsourced. We believe that the benefits of our effective claims collection strategy result in long-standing client relationships, evidenced by entering into master servicing agreements to provide collection services on clients’ debt and other defaulted receivables that we have not purchased.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

These line items are also among the financial data related to comprehensive income that appear in the in the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements and the Unaudited Group Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” for information regarding our financial information. _Income from portfolio investments_ Income from portfolio investments (the Group’s owned debt portfolios) represents the yield from owned debt portfolio investments, net of VAT where applicable. Owned debt portfolio investments are financial instruments that are accounted for using IAS 39 (Financial Instruments), and are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts of the owned debt portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition (i.e., the price paid to acquire the asset). These estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the conditions within the markets in which the Group operates and range from 84 months to 120 months. Owned debt portfolio investments are purchased at a deep discount and as a result the estimated future cash flows reflect the likely credit losses within each portfolio. _Net portfolio write-up_ Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cash flows be deemed greater than previous estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period considered for estimated future cash receipts. Upward adjustments to carrying values as a result of reassessments to forecasted cash flows are recognized in the net portfolio write-up line item within income, with subsequent reversals also recorded in this line. If these reversals exceed cumulative income recognized to date, an impairment is recognized in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Portfolio fair value release_ Portfolio fair value adjustments are made as part of the purchase price allocations when the group acquires other companies. These adjust the value of the portfolios to fair value. The portfolio fair value release ----- represents the unwinding of this fair value uplift. This uplift is being unwound in line with the profile of the gross ERC over an 84 month period from the date of acquisition in keeping with the standard collection curve profile in the UK. _Service revenue_ Service revenue represents amounts receivable for tracing and debt collecting services (commissions and fees) provided to third-party clients including collection lawyers, net of VAT where applicable. The revenue is recognized when the service is provided (accrual basis) which in this case is when cash is collected from the consumer on behalf of the Group’s client. _Collection activity costs_ Collection activity costs represent the direct third-party costs incurred in providing services as a debt collection agency or collecting debts on owned debt portfolio investments; examples include printing and postage, third party commissions, search and trace costs, litigation, telephone and SMS text costs. They are recognized as the costs are incurred (accruals basis). _Other expenses_ Other expenses consist of operating expenses such as staff costs, office rent and other expenses related to the premises, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets, together with the write-down of non-performing loans, among other expenses. _Finance income_ Finance income consists of the interest receivable on our bank accounts, and the fair value measurement of derivatives. _Finance costs_ Finance costs consist of interest charges and fees on the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, interest accruing on shareholder loan notes issued by our parent undertaking, together with losses on the fair value of financial instruments and foreign exchange losses. _Tax (expense) / credit_ The charge/credit for taxation is based on trading results, and takes account of taxation deferred or accelerated because of timing differences between the treatments of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes, principally the treatment of capital expenditure, for which capital allowances allowable for taxation purposes differs from depreciation for accounting purposes, the timing and utilization of tax losses, and the nondeductibility of an element of the interest accruing on shareholder loans and shares.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The decrease was primarily due to the deferment of expected collections as a result of COVID-19. _Portfolio fair value release_ Portfolio fair value release decreased by £0.2 million, or 25.0%, to £0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from £0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Portfolio fair value adjustments are made as part of the purchase price allocations when the Group acquires other companies. These adjust the value of the portfolio to fair value. The portfolio fair value release represents the unwinding of the fair value uplift. The decrease is primarily due to the unwinding of the fair value uplift on portfolio valuation of the UK Division at the time of the acquisition of the Lowell Group. There was greater release in the early years due to the front loaded nature of the ERC curve, which was used as the basis for the release. _Service revenue_ Service revenue decreased by £17.5 million, or 15.8%, to £93.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from £111.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the strategic closure of Frederickson International as part of our UK 3PC business. _Collection activity costs_ Collection activity costs decreased by £31.5 million, or 18.1%, to £142.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from £174.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by the decision to cease litigation activity in the UK in response to COVID-19 developments alongside general collection efficiency improvements. Out of our total collection activity costs, lawyer service costs were £19.5 million and non-recurring costs were £1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to £26.4 million and £2.5 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2019. ----- _Other expenses_ Other expenses decreased by £19.2 million, or 14.6%, to £111.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from £131.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to cost reduction initiatives together with a reduced number of FTEs as the business becomes more digital and efficient. Out of the £111.9 million of other expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2020, £21.0 million constituted depreciation, amortization and impairment and £15.7 million constituted non-recurring costs, compared to £19.9 million and £22.9 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2019. _Finance income_ Finance income increased by £9.8 million to £13.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from £3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to movements in the fair value of the derivatives held by the Group. _Finance costs_ Finance costs decreased by £0.8 million, or 0.7%, to £108.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from £109.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This movement reflects the impact of an overall increase in debt held which has been offset by a reduction in net loss on financial instruments designated as fair value through profit or loss. _Income tax credit_ Income tax credit increased by £12.3 million, or 768.8%, to £13.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from £1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to primarily due the recognition of a £12.3 million deferred tax asset recognized within the UK.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

For the three-months ended March 31, 2018, the unaudited consolidated results of Lowell Sverige and its subsidiaries and the unaudited consolidated results of Lowell AS and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with IFRS and Norwegian GAAP, respectively. As such, Lowell Sverige’s and Lowell AS’s respective accounting policies and treatments and financial definitions may differ from each other and those of the Group for such period. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated _Financial Information.”_ (b) The Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial Information reflects the following adjustments: (i) the assets and liabilities of the Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS and their subsidiaries were recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), requiring purchase price adjustments to certain assets, primarily existing customer relationships and owned debt portfolios; (ii) the ERC curves of the Lowell Sverige, Lowell AS and their subsidiaries’ owned debt portfolios were adjusted from 180-months to 120-months; (iii) finance costs were adjusted as if the 2018 Acquisitions, including the issuance of the Existing Hansa Notes and other related financing transactions, had occurred on January 1, 2018; and (iv) income tax (expense) / credit was adjusted in accordance with the above. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Financial _Information.” Income from portfolio investments_ Income from portfolio investments increased by £37.8 million, or 11.1%, to £377.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from £339.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a 3.6% increase in portfolio purchases to £397.3 million as at December 31, 2019 from £383.6 million as at December 31, 2018 and the full 2019 year impact of the 2018 Acquisitions. ----- _Net portfolio write-up_ Net portfolio write-up increased by £18.7 million, or 14.8%, to £144.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from £126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to strong collection performance on the backbook during the period, driven by an increase in litigation activity and targeted collection activity within older vintages unlocking additional value whilst also implementing other operational initiatives. This has led to an increase in net portfolio write-up for the period ended December 2019, compared to December 2018. _Portfolio fair value release_ Portfolio fair value release decreased by £0.4 million, or 20.0%, to £1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from £2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Portfolio fair value adjustments are made as part of the purchase price allocations when the Group acquires other companies. These adjust the value of the portfolio to fair value. The portfolio fair value release represents the unwinding of the fair value uplift. The decrease is primarily due to the unwinding of the fair value uplift on portfolio valuation of the UK Division at the time of the acquisition of the Lowell Group. There was greater release in the early years due to the front loaded nature of the ERC curve, which was used as the basis for the release. _Service revenue_ Service revenue increased by £14.7 million, or 7.2%, to £218.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from £204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to the full 2019 year impact of the 2018 Acquisitions which has been offset by a loss in revenue from the sale of the payments division in Northern Europe in 2018. _Collection activity costs_ Collection activity costs increased by £42.6 million, or 14.2%, to £342.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from £299.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased collection activity across both debt purchase and debt servicing divisions and the full 2019 year impact of the 2018 Acquisitions. _Other expenses_ Other expenses increased by £17.5 million, or 7.4%, to £253.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from £235.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to a full 2019 year impact of the 2018 Acquisitions, partially offset by the Group’s activities to reduce cost. _Finance income_ Finance income increased by £4.4 million to £6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from £1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a £3.9 million gain made by the Group following the repurchase of £33.5 million of the existing senior unsecured notes in August 2019. The net effect of currency exchange movements on finance income was a gain of £1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Finance costs_ Finance costs increased by £28.1 million, or 14.3%, to £224.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from £195.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase reflects an increase in gross debt drawn during 2018. This includes a full 12 months of the Existing €530 million 2023 Euro Notes and the Existing 2023 SEK Notes associated with the 2018 Acquisitions and the impact of overall net debt increase under the Luigi Securitization and Revolving Credit Facility during 2019 to support the business growth. The net effect of currency exchange movements on finance costs was nil for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to loss of £1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Income tax credit_ Income tax credit increased by £4.9 million, or 213.0%, to £7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from £2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in loss for the period and a reduction in the tax losses carried forward. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies— _Reclassification of prior year presentation” to the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements. Income from portfolio investments._ Income from portfolio investments increased by £94.2 million, or 38.4%, to £339.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from £245.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in portfolio investments. Portfolio investments increased by £596.5 million, or 61.8%, between December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 to £1,561.0 million. This was due primarily to the 2018 Acquisitions, which contributed £387.5 million to portfolio investments upon completion. _Net portfolio write-up_ Net portfolio write-up increased by £24.2 million, or 23.7%, to £126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from £101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to strong collection on assets owned in the year ended December 31, 2018. _Portfolio fair value release_ Portfolio fair value release increased by £0.6 million, or 23.1%, to £2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from £2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the unwinding of the fair value uplift on portfolio valuation of the UK Division at the time of the acquisition of the Lowell Group. There was greater release in the early years due to the front loaded nature of the ERC curve, which was used as the basis for the release. ----- _Service revenue_ Service revenue increased by £39.2 million, or 23.8%, to £204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from £164.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to an increase in third-party debt under management, primarily as a result of the 2018 Acquisitions, which in turn increased the amount of commissions received from our service of third-party debt. _Collection activity costs_ Collection activity costs increased by £61.3 million, or 25.7%, to £299.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from £238.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher levels of collection activity and increasing levels of portfolios held due to larger Group operations. _Other expenses_ Other expenses increased by £69.7 million, or 42.0%, to £235.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from £166.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the increased scale of the business following the 2018 Acquisitions and related infrastructure and operating costs. _Finance income_ Finance income decreased by £0.6 million to £1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from £2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a £1.8 million premium release on existing debt in the year ended December 31, 2017. _Finance costs_ Finance costs increased by £19.8 million, or 11.2%, to £195.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from £176.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased interest expenses and fees on the Existing Notes, related to higher debt levels following the 2018 Acquisitions. _Income tax (expense) / credit_ Income tax expense decreased by £4.1 million, to a £2.3 million credit for the year ended December 31, 2018 from a £1.8 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the impact of tax losses carried forward, partly offset by the change in value of deferred taxes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The Group’s principal sources of liquidity have been funds raised in connection with bond offerings, its cash flow generated by operations (before portfolio acquisition costs), borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, securitizations of owned debt portfolios such under the Luigi Securitization and the Milla Securitization, and shareholder loans. While the Group’s collections have historically been predictable throughout the year, its debt purchase activity can vary greatly from one quarter to the next. This is driven by the timing of one-off debt sales by vendors during the year, the timing of which the Group does not control, along with its own desire to purchase a portfolio at a given point in time. This could lead to volatility in the Group’s cash balances quarter on quarter. The Group’s ability to generate cash from operations depends on its future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond its control, as well as other factors discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” We believe that the combined operating cash flows of the Group, together with the cash resources and future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our debt and tax servicing requirements as they become due, working capital requirements and anticipated debt purchases, although this may not be the case. In particular, future drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will only be available if, among other things, we meet the financial covenant included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” ----- As of June 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources. However, as a result of COVID-19, global financial markets have experienced overall volatility and disruptions to capital and credit markets. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and how that may impact our cash flows and our ability to settle debt. As of June 30, 2020, on a pro _forma basis to reflect the Offering and the uses of proceeds therefrom, up to €445 million would have been_ available for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility on a committed basis. As of the Issue Date, we expect we will have the equivalent of £      million drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility (compared to £403.4 million as of June 30, 2020). If necessary, we may increase the utilization of our Revolving Credit Facility in the future to further improve our cash position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or for other purposes. We may also increase the utilization of our Milla Securitization and Luigi Securitization programs or enter into one or more additional securitization transactions to further improve our cash position. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have no plans to increase the utilization of these programs or to enter into any such transactions.

The legal and regulatory environment post-Brexit is inherently uncertain, yet we believe the regulatory regimes in our markets have achieved a level of maturity and stability that may mitigate this risk. However should the UK and EU regulatory regimes diverge, then this could limit our ability to operate in a manner consistent with past practice and increase operating and compliance costs particularly in regards to the ability to transfer personal data. With respect to the macroeconomic environment of the UK and Europe, if Brexit were to trigger a recession or period of prolonged economic uncertainty, management believes the effect on our business would be mixed. While an economic downturn may reduce our consumers’ ability to pay, the sustainability of a majority of our payment plans as well as the countervailing effects of declining interest rates on our consumers’ variable rate debt burden may mitigate this effect. Furthermore, a recession may increase the volume of non-performing loans in the market and provide us with more purchasing and contingent placement opportunities. Additionally, our ERCs are generally front-loaded, with approximately 34% of the UK Division’s collections realized in the first 24 months of the ERC curve (acting as a natural hedge against deteriorating economic conditions).

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.1,Introduction to the CMS Industry,5.1.1,,"Debt is created when a debt originator extends credit to a person, who in turn becomes a customer of that debt originator. Such arrangements include financial institutions extending loans or trade sector companies issuing invoices for services rendered or goods delivered (e.g., retail and telecommunications companies or public-sector entities, among others). Debtors default on their payment obligations when they do not repay the debt according to the terms on which it was extended, which results in the debt becoming overdue. Defaulted debt is an inherent feature of unsecured lending. Debt originators typically expect a certain percentage of consumers to default and, accordingly, manage their pricing to a target default level. Defaulted debt may be collected by the debt originator itself, by a law firm on behalf of the debt originator or by a Credit Management Services (CMS) company, such as the Group. Debt, whether it is overdue or not, may be collected by either the originator itself or by a third-party to whom the originator has either sold the debt or merely outsourced its collection. For many debt originators, the management of defaulted debt is a low priority or non-core activity because volumes of defaulted debt are small relative to the overall scale of lending and debt originators do not generally invest much capital in their respective collection systems. Accordingly, outsourcing the collection of defaulted debt to a CMS company is an attractive option for many debt originators. Depending on the debt originators’ preferences and objectives, a CMS company either manages the defaulted debt on behalf of the debt originator according to a servicing agreement, or purchases the defaulted debt from the debt originator, thereby taking legal ownership of the debt and acquiring the right to collect on it for its own account. The Group purchases defaulted debt and manages defaulted debt on behalf of third-party debt originators. Our geographical footprint comprises some of the largest consumer credit markets in Europe, including the UK, Germany and Northern Europe, with a leading presence in Austria as well. The following chart illustrates the relative maturity profile of the CMS industry in our markets as compared to the CMS industry in other key international markets. As the chart indicates, both the UK and Northern Europe, given the large scale of their economies and overall levels of indebtedness, and Germany and Austria given attractive growth profiles, provide opportunities for greater debt collection outsourcing and debt portfolio sales. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

For example, in December 2018 the European Council issued new regulations on non-performing loans in Europe that implemented an increased risk-weighting of unsecured non-performing loans in the calculation of risk-weighted assets to 150%. Furthermore, in January 2019, the European Council published a final compromise text for updated non-performing loan regulations, to establish a prudential backstop. The new regulations expanded on existing legislation by requiring bank entities to fully write down unsecured non-performing loans after three years and secured NPLs after seven years. Further, in March 2019, the European Council’s position on a proposed directive which harmonizes rules for how non-credit institutions can buy credit agreements from banks was approved. With these proposals, the Council aims to create a prudential framework for banks to deal with new non-performing loans and thus reduce the risk of accumulation in the future, potentially further emphasizing incentives for higher nonperforming loan sales. As a result of COVID-19, loan loss provisions made by the 20 largest European banks increased by more than three times in the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2019, potentially creating a large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets across Europe that will be affected by these regulatory changes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.3,Credit Lifecycle,5.3.1,,"CMS is an established part of the credit lifecycle in the UK, Germany and Northern Europe. There are a number of stages in the debt lifecycle and CMS companies offer several services to clients throughout the cycle. The debt recovery cycles in the UK, German and Northern European markets are broadly similar in their components. However, the relative importance of third-party collection versus debt purchase and the timing of third parties’ involvement in the recovery cycle tend to differ between these markets. While, in the UK, a portfolio is often sold following at least one DCA placement, in Germany, debt sale and third-party collection are often viewed as alternatives to recovering on defaulted debt and in Northern Europe, the CMS market is highly mature with, on average, a significantly higher volume of debt outsourced to be managed on third-party basis compared to the rest of Europe (~60% in Northern Europe compared to ~45% in the rest of Europe, based on a 2017 third party report). The debt recovery cycle encompasses the following steps: - **Origination of debt. A consumer obtains credit from a debt originator. The financial services sector has historically been one of the largest sources of credit for consumers, but short- or longterm consumer credit is also a core component of business models across many other sectors, including telecommunications, retail, utilities and e-commerce. ----- - **Default. A consumer defaults on his or her payment obligations. For example, the consumer may fail to make a series of scheduled payments. This may happen because of a change in the consumer’s circumstances (e.g., the loss of a job) or because the consumer entered into debt arrangements that prove unmanageable. - **In-house recovery. The debt originator uses its internal resources to attempt to recover the defaulted debt. Debt originators typically have standard procedures that apply when a consumer account falls into arrears, which include the use of internal recovery strategies and in-house debt collection activity to attempt to rehabilitate consumer accounts. Regularly, debt originators either fail to make contact with the consumer or are unable to reach an acceptable agreement on a payment. - **Engagement of CMS. Defaulted debt portfolios are serviced by third parties for a fee. The legal ownership and balance-sheet exposure remain with the debt originators. CMS companies provide debt collection services to debt originators for overdue debt. Litigation techniques are often used when the consumer’s ability to pay has been demonstrated but the consumer is unwilling to pay. - **Debt sale. Defaulted debt portfolios are sold to third parties at a significant discount to the principal value of the debt. The legal ownership and balance-sheet exposure are thereby transferred to the debt purchasers. - **Other CMS. In the UK, Germany and Northern Europe, CMS companies are increasingly active throughout the recovery process. End-to-end recovery management provides growth opportunities for such companies, for instance, in early-stage recovery (e.g., prior to the consumer’s default). Before debt originators extend credit to consumers, CMS companies can also provide credit scoring and other forms of credit information services, such as data extraction and modelling. CMS companies also provide payment processing services, including invoice administration, subsidiary ledger accounting, invoice printing, payment reminders and consumer checks related to the ability to make purchases on account. These services can be provided either before or after debt is defaulted and, in certain cases, before the debt originator-customer relationship is first created (i.e., before a consumer purchase takes place).

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.5,Debt Purchasing,5.5.1,,"Debt purchasing entails the sale of financial debt by a debt originator to a specialist debt purchaser or investor who acquires the right to collect the debt for its own account and retain the cash collected. The purchaser then typically seeks to reinvest this cash, net of collection costs, in acquisitions of new debt portfolios. Originators ----- may sell portfolios of performing or non-performing loans to CMS companies for a number of reasons relating to operational and economic efficiency. Selling non-performing loans enables originators to, among other things, increase liquidity, strengthen their balance sheets, liberate internal resources to focus on core competencies and reduce back office costs associated with their in-house collection infrastructure. Debt originators generally choose to sell performing loans for similar reasons, though this can also be due to a decision to withdraw from a particular product or geography which is no longer profitable or core to their future strategy. _Debt Sale Pricing: Paying vs. Non-Paying Accounts_ In general, prices are lower for accounts that have been in default for extended periods or have passed through several DCA placement cycles due to lower than expected recovery rates compared to prices for defaulted accounts that are currently making regular payments (often below contractual terms). Generally, a DP will acquire non-paying debt (in various states of delinquency) at a price heavily discounted from the face value of the debt, while prices for paying debt are typically higher compared to prices for non-paying debt. In the case of paying accounts, DPs acquire annuity-like cash flow streams (even if payments are less than the contracted amount under the terms of the original indebtedness), while for non-paying accounts, they need to make contact with the customer and establish a sustainable and affordable repayment plan. Making contact, and agreeing a repayment plan, with the customer is generally difficult for accounts that have been in default longer, and this is therefore reflected in the lower pricing of such accounts. This drives the variance in indicative pricing for various types of non-paying accounts and paying accounts. _Methods of Debt Sale_ Debt originators may structure their sales of debt portfolios in one of the following ways: - _Off-market sales / bilateral agreements: Financial institutions generally use off-market transactions to simplify the sale process, where the transaction size does not justify running a competitive process or for the sale of complex portfolios. In off-market sales, the vendor originator considers just one party for the sale (typically a well-reputed and trusted partner with which it has a long-standing relationship), and if the price offered by the buyer is considered appropriate, the vendor originator sells the debt portfolio to the buyer without inviting any other bidders. - _Limited auction: For the sale of portfolios with a relatively high level of complexity, vendor originators will often typically invite a few bidders to a tender process, which involves a greater level of more manual loan file due diligence. - _Broad auction: For the sale of some classes of debt, vendor originators will often initiate widely competitive tender processes, including five to six bidders or more. The relevant portfolios are generally priced by bidders using statistical models, and are often broken down into segments, with each segment being sold to the highest bidder. Such auctions become more difficult when portfolios are more complex and data quality is poor, including in less mature markets. - _Forward flow agreements: These involve agreements to sell several similar debt portfolios over a period of time at a predetermined price and for a specified quality of debt, avoiding fluctuations caused by changes in macroeconomic conditions and outcomes of precedent auctions. In general, we are protected against downside risk in debt quality through provisions in the forward flow agreements. In the case of our UK forward flow agreements, there is flexibility to modify pricing upon a detailed review of the portfolios. Similarly, in the case of our German forward flow agreements, we are protected through put back mechanisms and certain representations and warranties from the seller, and typically in the case of the Northern European Division’s forward flow agreements, through the ability to re-negotiate, re-price (in combination with a termination right of the counterparty) and terminate in case of a change in the counterparty’s credit decision policy or credit issuing process.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.6,Debt Servicing,5.6.1,,"Debt servicing is a service provided by a CMS company that collects financial debt on behalf of a third global party (typically the debt originator). Servicers generally receive a fee related either to the face value of the debt portfolios they manage or the collections generated, depending on the nature of the managed portfolio. CMS companies may provide debt collection services to debt originators for either performing or non-performing debt. Collections of non-performing debt can be particularly burdensome for debt originators because it can be time ----- consuming and costly, especially when compared to specialists who have the key competencies and experience and are appropriately structured to do so more efficiently. Additionally, debt originators may choose to outsource the collection of some of their accounts to a CMS company with a view to assess the performance of their internal debt recovery performance operations. Collection of performing debt may be outsourced because of a desire to reduce back office or IT costs (to turn fixed overhead costs into variable costs) or to benefit from economies of scale that can be offered by CMS companies. _Methods of Debt Servicing_ The terms and the fee structure of a servicing agreement typically depend on whether it concerns the servicing of non-performing or performing loans and type of debt, whether consumer or corporate, secured or unsecured, etc. _NPL service agreements: Debt servicing agreements for outsourced NPLs typically have a defined_ minimum term with tacit renewal and at least a three-month termination notice by either party. Service agreements for non-performing loans can take a wide variety of forms with specific guidelines regarding reporting obligations, thresholds for debt forgiveness and guidelines regarding incurrence of costs. Service agreements for nonperforming loans also tend to have customary confidentiality, compliance and data privacy clauses, as well as an audit clause and limitation of financial responsibility for the servicer. _Performing debt service agreements: Debt servicing agreements for performing debt typically have a_ stated term commensurate with the remaining life of the portfolio but can be terminated with an advance notice. Performing debt servicing agreements typically include either a flat fee per month and/or per loan which varies depending upon the size, duration and nature of the debt, or a variable fee based on assets under management, which also varies depending upon the size, duration and nature of the claims. Service agreements for performing debt tend to have customary confidentiality, compliance and data privacy clauses, as well as a service level agreement and an audit clause that permits the bank to monitor the quality of the provider’s services. Typically, these agreements also limit the financial responsibility for the servicer. CMS companies have also sought to increasingly target a wider breadth of credit active customers earlier in the value chain, through the provision of an enhanced range of value-added services before loans and receivables are overdue. These services typically include: - Invoicing: The client can outsource its accounts receivable process, including collection activity. This is a particularly reliable and cost efficient solution for clients with high invoicing volumes - Payment: This enables retailers and other consumer companies to make a real time credit decision at the time of purchase, and gives them the ability to offer customers payment through invoice or a part payment solution. The CMS company manages the entire credit process, from scoring and credit decision to processing and distributing invoices - Information services: This typically includes credit analysis, data extraction and modelling, as well as selection and scoring of potential customers.

DCAs and DPs are subject to substantial due-diligence before entering into consideration. - **Customer treatment: Good customer experience, particularly in regards to dealings with vulnerable customers, is a fundamental requirement. This has become increasingly important as regulation has tightened in this area (e.g., the FCA’s principles in relation to treating customers fairly). - **Relationships: Buyer relationships are also highly important considerations for debt originator panels. The significant cost in oversight means that creditors are increasingly looking to establish long-term relationships with a select set of DCA/DPs. ----- - **Price: Once included on the panel, price is often, but not always, the key factor in winning a debt sale or BPO/DCA role. - **Ability to execute and operational capabilities: In awarding a mandate, credibility and proven ability to execute are key for creditors.

For example, such debt may be classified by its quality. Key drivers of the quality of debt, and therefore its price, include its age, its average balance and the level of difficulty in contacting its consumer base. Accordingly, CMS companies may, for instance, classify consumer debt by its stage in the debt-recovery cycle. Credit card asset classes, for example, typically vary from fresh write-offs (i.e., accounts that have generally not been placed with DCAs at the time of sale) to accounts that have remained defaulted for a longer period of time prior to being outsourced, and CMS companies may focus on one or more of such classes.

This market was initially developed as a method for debt originators to manage defaulted loans and to accelerate capital release for defaulted debt, the value of which had already been significantly written down. The market commenced with small-scale transactions by CMS companies that generally had access to small funding lines. The UK debt purchase market underwent significant growth from 2000 to 2008, fueled by a rapid rise in outstanding consumer debt together with increasing default rates. The onset of the financial crisis in 2008 resulted in a substantial withdrawal of funding supply from the debt purchasers operating in the sector and an increased cost of funding for those debt purchasers that remained active. Reduced funding supply, coupled with a difficult collections environment in which debt purchasers were no longer able to agree settlements with borrowers, resulted in the exit of many debt purchasers from the market. Since 2010, however, the UK debt purchase market has experienced a recovery and is now one of the largest defaulted consumer debt markets in Europe. Today, the debt purchase and collection industry has become an integral component of the debt recovery process in the UK and helps UK debt originators manage the asset quality in their loan portfolios. This has become particularly important as capital and liquidity requirements imposed by regulators and investors increase. Increasingly, CMS companies have also become an important tool for non-financial debt originators, such as telecommunications and retail companies (as described below), to outsource the management of their bad debt and focus on their core businesses. The UK consumer credit market is a large and mature market for debt purchases, which, since the beginning of 2010, has returned to growth, driven by availability of funding and the increasing willingness of debt originators to sell debt given increasing pressure to reduce the costs of holding and managing defaulted debt. The industry has also come under increased scrutiny, primarily as a result of high levels of indebtedness affecting many individuals in the United Kingdom, which ultimately led to debt collection activity falling under the authority of the FCA in 2014. The sale of “fresher” debt has led to increasingly larger deal sizes, particularly in the United Kingdom. This has been a key factor in driving industry consolidation, with the larger more established players accessing new sources of funding and also benefiting from economies of scale. As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of non-performing loans outstanding was approximately £47.7 billion in the United Kingdom representing an NPL ratio of 1.3%. We believe the United Kingdom market has a strong pipeline, with approximately £6.7 billion completed in 2018, £10.0 billion completed in 2019, and we expect to continue to pursue attractive opportunities to acquire loan portfolios in the United Kingdom. The level of consumer credit in the United Kingdom stood at £224.1 billion as at December 2019, with new flows of £13.2 billion during the year. ----- _Attractions of the UK CMS Market_ - **Increasing concentration. In recent years, we believe that there has been a trend towards increased concentration of the UK CMS industry around a small core group of leading CMS companies and debt purchasers. Industry consolidation has been further supported by the tightening supply of credit globally during the financial crisis, with only the most experienced and reputable market participants being able to secure the necessary financing to support an active debt collection and debt acquisition program during that period. All the large participants in the UK debt purchase market have recently raised debt through high-yield bond issuances, which gives them more stable medium-term financing as compared to other smaller participants, thereby facilitating further industry consolidation. - **Increasing tendency to sell. Moreover, management expect that the propensity on the part of UK debt originators to sell debt portfolios earlier in the recovery process will continue. Debt originators increasingly tend to outsource the recovery of defaulted debt on account of their lack of internal resources, the desire to focus internal resources on core activities, the increased compliance cost and regulatory risk associated with increased regulation and the generally better cost structure of CMS companies. CMS companies offer a wide range of services, providing debt originators with a comprehensive solution for the management of delinquent debt that extracts higher value from their NPLs. - **Emerging market sectors. In the UK, the utilities, insurance and public sectors have historically accounted for a relatively small proportion of debt purchase and debt collection revenue as compared to the financial services, telecommunications and retail sectors. We believe these sectors represent new sources of supply for UK CMS companies.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.10,"Consumer Credit Outstanding by Country (£ billion, December 2019)",5.10.2,DACH,"_Attractions of the German CMS Market_ The German CMS industry matured from 2003-2007 after an economic downturn in the early 2000s when banks sold and outsourced the collection of a large amount of overdue debt. Activity decreased during the financial crisis from 2008-2010 before recovering in 2011. We believe that German debt originators across various sectors have a high propensity to outsource early in the credit cycle (i.e., after the due date, but before the debt becomes overdue by 45 days or, in the financial services sector generally, by 90 days), due to the limited presence of in-house collection operations at German debt originators. - **Supportive environment for outsourced CMS. Due to the limited in-house resources of many debt originators in Germany, CMS companies benefit from a large supply of outsourced debt. The trend is expected to continue due to the cost cutting pressure on German banks. Furthermore, the number of potential debt collectors chosen by a specific company tends to be small (which we believe to be one to three collectors, on average) for third-party collections and services, providing an opportunity to build partnership-like relationships with debt originators early in the recovery cycle. - **Wide range of revenue opportunities and longer time to work on debt. Debt is outsourced relatively early through BPO services prior to its due date, and outsourced collections and debt sales generally start 45 days after the respective due dates of the obligations. This “fresh” debt typically is of higher quality and has higher collection expectations, because less work has been applied to the assets to obtain consumer payments. Furthermore, it is possible to engage in longterm monitoring to identify potential solvency changes of consumers for up to 30 years (and, in some cases, for a longer period) in line with the applicable statute of limitations. Earlier access to debt and longer-term monitoring provide wider opportunities to capture fees and allow for more time to recover debt. - **Cultural attitudes towards debt repayment. German consumers tend to use debt for payments to a substantially lesser degree than consumers in other European countries, preferring to instead use cash and debit cards. The low comparative usage of credit in Germany could be driven by the additional fees charged to defaulted consumers, as well as by cultural attitudes towards indebtedness. As a result, consumers who do incur debt are generally more likely to want to repay it when able to do so. ----- - Specific fee and CMS remuneration structure. Different to other markets, German legislation and established industry practice offer a fee structure that allows CMS companies to charge delayed payment fees to consumers rather than charging commissions to the debt originators. The fact that the debt originators themselves are not allowed to charge these fees but DCAs/CMS companies are is further fueling third party collections. As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of non-performing loans outstanding was approximately £25.4 billion in Germany representing an NPL ratio of 1.3%. We believe the German market has a strong pipeline, with approximately £7.4 billion completed in 2018, £9.6 billion completed in 2019, and we expect to continue to pursue attractive opportunities to acquire loan portfolios. The level of consumer credit in Germany stood at £171.1 billion as at December 2019, with new flows of £7.1 billion during the year. _Attractions of the Austrian CMS Market_ In terms of the amount of defaulted consumer debt per capita and the percentage of debt collection currently outsourced to DCAs, we believe that Austria is significantly smaller than Germany and the UK. We believe there is a significant potential to benefit from higher outsourcing rates in Austria in the future. Also, since there are indications of a large pent-up NPL sale volume on the balance sheets of Austrian banks compared to other European banks, as well as a relatively low penetration of debt purchasers in the Austrian market, we believe there is potential for market participants to deploy their capital on debt purchases in the Austrian market at attractive returns. As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of non-performing loans outstanding was approximately £9.7 billion in Austria representing an NPL ratio of 2.3%. The level of consumer credit in Austria stood at £15.6 billion as at December 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

We believe that, based on a third-party market study, the stock of NPLs originated by financial institutions in the Northern European countries amounted to approximately €5 billion at the end of 2016. Furthermore, according to the third-party market study, stable NPL ratios and continued growth in total loans outstanding, owing to a growing economy and historically low interest rates, are expected to lead to a gradual increase in the NPL stock. Additionally, in the Northern European markets, a significant proportion of products and services are sold with payment in the future (e.g., invoices, short term facilities, etc.)—creating a growing stock of consumer trade receivables by retail and telecommunications companies, utilities and companies in many other industries. This large stock also creates a consistent supply of defaulted unsecured trade debt outstanding that was estimated to be €4 billion at the end of 2016. Attractive trends in the Northern European CMS Market include the following: - **Enhanced rate of outsourcing and increasing importance of Debt Purchasing. This trend is expected to be underpinned by two primary factors: - Regulatory factors for financial institutions (e.g., the implementation of IFRS 9) are expected to increase the levels of outsourcing and sale of debt portfolios. Particularly, the desire to reduce the proportion of NPLs on their balance sheet and improve their capital ratios can be expected to lead to an increasing shift toward the sale of debt portfolios. We also expect an increased willingness amongst banks to re-evaluate their value chain and focus on their core business as they attempt to manage costs. - The emergence of niche consumer banks in the data rich Northern European markets, we believe, will also lead to a greater amount of outsourcing as such firms, which generally lack in-house collection capabilities, seek to partner with CMS companies that have proven collection capabilities. - **Increasing sophistication of clients leading to greater demand for CMS companies that offer",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

As of December 31, 2019, the combined total amount of non-performing loans outstanding in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden was approximately £21.1 billion, representing a blended NPL ratio of 1.2%.

Creditors are increasingly focused on cost reduction and process efficiencies. - **Smaller panels. Panels are used to maintain competitive intensity, but are generally reducing in size. - **More debt sold to DPs. Creditors are recognizing the value that DPs provide and are as a result selling more debt to DPs. - **Debt sold earlier.

Recently however, several international players from the Scandinavian and the U.S. markets (e.g., Hoist, Intrum and Encore) have expanded from their traditional geographical focuses and sought to compete in the UK. We believe that many of our UK Division’s current competitors have evolved with a specific investment focus and associated operational infrastructure, which may make them more or less suited to particular sectors of the market. Some purchasers are more focused on higher-balance debt or paying debt, which often requires less tracing capability and cost to collect efficiencies. The importance of historical benchmark data to guide prices on new debt portfolios means that market participants may also gravitate towards specialty niches in which they have ----- been more active in the past. As a result, current competitive dynamics primarily reflect the ability of each debt purchaser to generate appropriate returns on investment, based on its cost structure and operational capabilities. We believe that large, high-end debt purchasers have outpaced broader market growth in the UK.

We believe this has created certain challenges for a new entrant to create a sustainable business. We believe the following significant barriers to entry exist in the industry: - **Regulatory environment and compliance. The industry is subject to increasing levels of legal and regulatory oversight. We believe that, in this context, compliance track record and reputation are key to developing strong relationships with debt originators. Accordingly, we believe that debt collection in the UK, Germany and Northern Europe requires considerable investment in processes, know-how and management, making it potentially difficult for a new entrant to be competitive and increasing barriers to entry. See “Regulation.” ----- - **Data and pricing models. A new entrant would be unlikely to have an established model with which to price debt portfolios, given its lack of historical data sets important for substantiating and benchmarking collection curves and ultimately for formulating rational prices across varying debt types and consumer characteristics. - **Trace and collections platform. The ability to locate account holders, determine their financial circumstances and the recoverability of their debt is fundamental to success in collecting in a costeffective manner and generating an appropriate return on investment. The systems of a debt purchaser, such as the Group, have been developed over an extensive period of time, requiring substantial investment and expertise. - **Funding. Across the UK, Germany and Northern Europe, high-yield financing is used in combination with revolving credit facilities provided by major banks and securitization programs as flexible means of funding the purchase of additional debt portfolios. Without the necessary scale and a successful track record and verifiable projections supported by reliable pricing models, it could be difficult for a new entrant to obtain cost-effective debt funding to purchase debt portfolios. - **Economies of scale. Large debt purchasers can spread their fixed costs across their book of existing debt portfolios. This scale provides a cost advantage to an established debt purchaser when pricing new debt portfolios. - **Vendor relationships. Key debt originators have established relationships with the leading CMS companies in the UK, Germany and Northern Europe. Increasingly, such vendors are seeking to maintain relationships with a smaller number of service providers. Based on the panel relationships we have, we believe that vendors have reduced the size of their panels. This means that it is increasingly important for us to be present on panels. We believe we are amongst the large debt purchasers present on most major panels in our markets. Whether a debt purchaser has a reputation for being able to transact purchases on a sustainable basis and a track record of regulatory compliance is a key consideration for certain vendors and may represent a considerable challenge for new entrants. - **Management expertise.

We believe that the business benefits from scale and diversification in terms of broad geographic reach and balanced revenue mix, together with a complementary and client-focused product offering. Furthermore, our expertise, management and financial resources provide the Group with excellent opportunities to drive further growth and diversification in a highly developed, data-rich credit market. These growth prospects are supported by our clear core competencies: (i) longstanding and multifaceted client relationships built on differentiated strategies for originating new business; (ii) a broad business model that is diversified across product offerings, markets and sectors; (iii) a strong track record of return on capital and reliable portfolio pricing; (iv) strong cash-generation capability featuring high predictability and visibility into future cash flows; and (v) a robust and improving governance framework with a focus on reputation and compliance that we believe is embedded in our operational activity. We provide a range of credit management services across the UK, DACH (collectively, Germany, Austria and Switzerland) and Northern Europe (collectively, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) to a broad client base that includes some of the largest credit providers in Europe. The principal activity of the Group is: the acquisition and collection of non-performing, generally unsecured, consumer debt portfolios (“DP”); and the provision of third party contingent collection (“3PC”) services. 3PC services include debt servicing offerings such as early stage collections, business process outsourcing, contingent collections, trace services and litigation activities. We operate 3PC services primarily in Germany, Austria and Northern Europe. The Group is very well regarded within the industry, a reputation that is further supported by the Group’s key strategic themes of strong customer focus and risk management. Best practices relating to our sophisticated pricing, decision science and cost-optimization experience are continuously shared across our business and make the Group a trusted partner to credit originators and consumers alike. Our Group generated total income of £746.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £657.1 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated operating profit of £150.5 million, Group cash income of £949.6 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of £496.0 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated operating profit of £112.0 million, Group cash income of £930.3 million and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA of £512.7 million (£280.9 million in our UK Division, £101.4 million in our DACH Division and £133.2 million in our Northern European Division, net of £2.7 million of Group costs). As of June 30, 2020, our Gross Money Multiple was 2.6x in the UK Division, 3.2x in the DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division and we had £13.2 billion (as of December 31, 2019: £12.4 billion) of third-party debt under management. We believe that we are a more diversified business than ever before, with a scaled pan-European presence and a range of services on offer that compares favorably to peers. Our ability to provide a full range of services across the CMS value chain helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectable data, which in turn supports the development of tailored collection strategies and analytical capabilities to more accurately price portfolios. Operating with a balanced business model across Europe also enables us to allocate resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the opportunities that are most attractive. Furthermore, the acquisition of the Northern European Division in 2018 has enabled the Group to provide clients with an enhanced range of value-added services before loans and receivables are overdue. These include invoicing, in which the client can outsource its CMS to the Northern European Division, and ability to offer consumers payment through invoice or part payment solutions and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information. These solutions have enabled us to access a wider breadth of credit active customers earlier in the value chain, before the delinquency phase. As the Group continues to develop, we expect to further capitalize on the Group’s strengths by: (i) delivering a multi-product, multi-service and pan-regional offering while maintaining clear pricing discipline; (ii) establishing an industry benchmark for operational excellence through investments in its one-stop service offering; (iii) maintaining a reputation for pioneering insights by continuously improving its IT, data and collection platforms through innovations and investment; (iv) continuing to take a best practices approach to its client relationships and (v) continuing to invest in its employees and corporate culture. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was £496.0 million and £512.7 million, respectively. We believe the scale of the Group provides several strategic benefits, including bolstering our ability to competitively price portfolios in our debt purchasing activities and develop optimal collection strategies, which we believe will have a positive impact on our revenue and efficiency. Additionally, we believe that the large scale of our business allows us to absorb fixed costs better than our smaller peers, including those related to regulatory and legal, compliance and IT, which should further benefit our margins. Our Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA margin, defined as Group cash income divided by Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA, was 55.1% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, an improvement from the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. We believe the Group’s expanded geographic footprint across our eight core markets, with top-three positions in seven of those markets, combined with top-tier local market positions is a competitive advantage which will further enhance our ability to follow our clients across markets and deepen client relationships. The UK Division, DACH Division and the Northern European Division, our current market-leading and complementary operational divisions, operate primarily in the largest consumer credit markets in Europe, the UK, Germany and Northern Europe. As of December 2019, the UK had approximately £224 billion (according to the Bank of England), Germany had approximately £171 billion and Northern Europe had approximately £158 billion (according to European Central Bank, Swedish Central Bank, Danish Central Bank and Norges Bank) of consumer credit outstanding. In the year ended December 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we invested £397.3 million and £351.1 million, respectively, to acquire debt portfolios. As of June 30, 2020, we had £13.2 billion of third-party debt under management (a 1.6% increase compared to June 30, 2019), with LTM placements of over £2.2 billion. In addition, we believe that by focusing on a broad range of sectors, we are able to address a greater portion of all consumer credit volumes generated annually in the UK, DACH and Northern Europe, than we would otherwise be able to address with a less comprehensive approach. We are a market leader and a pioneer in servicing debt originators across multiple sectors. We also have a strong track record of successfully entering new market ----- sectors and gaining high market shares in those sectors, such as the telecommunications, retail and public sectors in the UK, the insurance and fitness sectors in Germany and the financial services sector in Northern Europe. In the UK, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we believe we had a market-leading share of lowbalance debt portfolio purchases in the telecommunications sector and were among the market leaders in the retail sector of the UK debt purchase market. In Germany, we believe we are in the top four CMS by revenue. Across Northern Europe, the Northern European Division purchases debt portfolios across a wide array of industry verticals and holds the number two market position, as defined by debt collection revenue, in Sweden and Finland. It is also ranked amongst the top three in Denmark and amongst the top five in Norway. We believe our scale provides key benefits critical to our success. For example, we are able to develop and maintain a superior operating platform, with highly skilled talent, customized IT systems and sophisticated analytical and data capabilities that drive pricing and debt-collection efficiencies. We believe our scale also enables us to absorb costs associated with legal obligations and regulatory oversight and allows us to provide our clients with a comprehensive service offering capable of addressing their needs throughout the debt recovery cycle. Due to our ability to provide a one-stop service offering, we believe we are able to better maintain and develop relationships with large debt originators than our smaller peers in the UK, DACH and Northern European markets, and as a result, are better positioned than our smaller peers for rapid growth in these respective markets. Furthermore, we believe that the acquisition of the Northern European Division has helped our competitive advantages and fortified our position as a preeminent player in the European CMS sector. The Company has a proven track record of maintaining long-term relationships with clients which include some of the largest credit originators in Europe. We have also historically achieved high levels of repeat purchases from existing customers, which we believe showcases the strong credentials and reputation of our business.

The UK, Germany and Northern Europe have historically benefited from stable macroeconomic conditions, including high levels of per capita GDP, low inflation, low interest rates and low unemployment levels. Despite uncertainty around post-Brexit UK and the COVID-19 outbreak and their respective economic and social ramifications, we believe that our core markets will continue to benefit from supportive structural factors and an improving macroeconomic environment post-COVID-19. In addition, we believe that the legal and regulatory environment in each jurisdiction is strong and stable, which, in our view, fosters market stability. Similarly, we believe that the UK will continue to have a stable legal and regulatory environment as it applies to our business. We also believe that the demanding nature of regulatory compliance in UK, Germany and Northern Europe can be burdensome to small businesses and may therefore increase consolidation opportunities for large players in the CMS. Moreover, the markets in which we operate comprise a diverse range of sectors in which consumer debt is originated (e.g., the financial services, insurance, retail, telecommunications, public and utilities sectors, among others). We believe we are able to develop business in this broad range of sectors, in part, because CMS companies such as ours can provide certain benefits to debt originators across sectors, including consumer insights and cost reductions due to reduced administrative and labor costs, improved collection rates and a more professional approach to debt collection. Further, debt originators’ outsourcing of the debt collection process yields the additional benefit for the debt originator of reducing management time devoted to what is typically a non-core activity, while also providing additional consistency in debt handling with a more robustly documented audit trail. With respect to size and growth of consumer credit markets in our geographies, we believe that the market in the UK has several distinctive features that make it attractive to CMS companies like us. We believe that the UK is the largest consumer credit market in Europe, with an estimated £224 billion of outstanding debt as of December 2019, according to the Bank of England. In addition, we believe that the UK has one of the largest NPL markets in Europe by face value of defaulted debt sold annually. We believe that the UK consumer NPL market is consolidating around a small number of sophisticated and large-scale players, such as our UK business, which we believe is competitively advantaged to grow more quickly, and at higher levels of profitability, than its smaller peers. We believe such players have a number of structural advantages, including, for example, an ability to exploit more extensive consumer databases, a heightened capacity to absorb the burdens of an increasingly demanding compliance environment and an ability to more readily develop a comprehensive service offering for ----- their clients. Moreover, management has observed a growing propensity on the part of UK debt originators to sell debt portfolios earlier in the recovery process, and we believe that their demand for other CMS services is likely to increase, not just in response to COVID-19-related stress but throughout the credit cycle. Similarly, the consumer credit market in Germany is also distinguished by several features that, in our view, make it attractive to CMS companies. We believe that Germany is the second largest consumer credit market in Europe, with an estimated £171 billion of outstanding debt as of December 2019, according to the European Central Bank. In addition, Germany boasts a large stock of overall defaulted debt and is also one of the largest consumer NPL markets in Europe by flow of newly created unsecured consumer defaulted debt. A diverse range of German businesses, from sectors such as financial services, fitness, retail and telecommunications, originate consumer credit from a diverse consumer base. These businesses use a varied set of collection methods to support the debt recovery process and typically outsource the majority of their receivables collections. Moreover, management has observed demand among German debt originators for BPO services and a willingness on the part of German debt originators to outsource collection in the early stages of the recovery process (for example, by as early as 45 days after the original payment due date). Since the German CMS market is highly fragmented, with approximately 600 to 900 players, we believe that large players, such as the Group, have a competitive advantage due to the scale and the breadth of their client relationships, which helps them originate new debt purchases and 3PC agreements. In addition, we believe that Germany has both a strong repayment culture and creditor-friendly laws and regulations, and that together, these features create a favorable environment for debt collection. Creditors in Germany benefit from a long enforcement period against consumers, since the statutory limitation period in Germany for applying for and obtaining an enforcement title against consumers is generally three years and, once obtained, the enforcement title is valid for 30 years. Further, under German law, creditors are generally entitled to charge additional amounts to the consumer as damage caused by delayed payment, including default interest, the costs of third-party collection services and legal costs. Each of these factors has, in our view, helped to drive up the profitability of debt collection in Germany. The consumer credit market in Northern Europe is also a large and mature market with a stable regulatory regime. The credit management industry in Northern European countries has existed for more than 100 years, and matured significantly following the financial crisis in the 1990s, when debt collection companies, including the Northern European Division, grew their businesses and supported clients in their deleveraging of large, overdue debt portfolios. In 3PC services, clients have historically preferred well-known and established players. This has benefited the Northern European Division with its leading pan-Northern European platform. According to a market study by a leading consultancy firm in September 2017, the proportion of debt portfolio sales compared to 3PC serviced portfolios is expected to increase from their current level of approximately 40% of the overall NPL market, as clients, particularly financial institutions, show an increasing willingness to optimize their balance sheet. The Northern European Division is, thus, also well placed to take advantage of this trend owing to significant operational synergies among its business segments as its debt collection segment serves as an origination source for debt purchasing. Based on data from the European Banking Authority (“EBA”), European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately £0.5 trillion as of December 31, 2019, representing more than 1.2 times 2007 levels. We believe that European bank NPL stock could increase to as much as £1.2 trillion, based on a peak European NPL ratio of 6.8% reached in Q4 2013 and outstanding loans and advances of £18.0 trillion as of December 31, 2019. We expect continued regular and proactive sales by banks as they manage a broad range of new rules and regulations, such as Basel IV, IFRS 9 and ECB calendar provisioning. As a result, we anticipate an increase in debt sales as a proportion of NPL stock. Moreover, we believe that non-traditional, digital lenders that have experienced rapid loan book growth in recent years do not have in-house collection expertise and are likely to engage CMS players to service their portfolios.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.16,Our Key Strengths,5.16.3,A Balanced Business Model with Significant Diversification Benefits,"The Group operates a balanced and diversified business model. Our debt purchase business and 3PC services business generated 82% and 18% of Group cash income, respectively, for each of the year ended December 31, 2019 and 83% and 17%, respectively, the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our Group earned revenue from over 4,000 portfolios for our debt purchasing business and from over 300 different clients for our third-party collection services. In addition, we believe we have the most diversified industry mix among our peers. Our client base encompasses clients in the financial services, insurance, retail, telecommunications, fitness, public and utilities sectors, among others. As of June 30, 2020, our 120M ERC split by industry was financial services (58%), retail (22%), telecommunications (15%), and other (5%). For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Group’s portfolio purchases split by industry was financial services (61%), retail (17%), telecommunications (13%) and other (10%). The Group is able to provide ----- these clients with a one-stop service offering that includes third-party collection services, risk management and value-added services. We believe this one-stop service offering helps us both to build strategic partnerships and to embed ourselves further in our clients’ credit-management processes. For example, management has observed that our provision of third-party debt collection services can lead to debt purchases and help improve our debt portfolio modelling. In addition to diversification, we believe our pan-European presence allows us to realize a number of key benefits that we believe provides us with key competitive advantages. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the UK Division, DACH Division and Northern European Division contributed 47.7%, 27.4% and 24.9%, respectively, to Group cash income. We believe the combination of allocating capital at a group level into markets where we believe our risk/reward return is the most attractive and the expertise of the individual businesses allows us to allocate capital and originate business across markets, sectors and clients to wherever we see the greatest opportunities. We believe that this increased flexibility enhances our adaptability and resilience in changing market trends and economic cycles. Moreover, since we have a higher volume of accounts, spread across a more diverse array of sectors and debt originators, we believe we are advantaged in our pricing accuracy and our ability to enhance the efficiency of our collection processes. Our broad-based business model has been enhanced by the acquisition of the Northern European Division, which is active across the entire CMS value chain in Northern Europe. In addition to 3PC services and debt purchasing, the Northern European Division provides a wide range of value-added services before debt and receivables are overdue, including consumer and credit information and analysis, selection and scoring of potential consumers, invoicing and the commercialization of data to provide value to clients’ credit management capabilities, including credit decisions, company payment behavior monitoring services and payment information. The Northern European Division has reinforced our flexibility and balanced product offering, which we believe positions us well to maximize revenue by offering solutions to clients along the entire CMS value chain, enabling us to operate as a “one-stop shop” for our clients. While our predominant activities continue to remain debt collection and debt purchasing, the value-added services segment has become an important source of origination for the debt purchasing and debt collection businesses and for data collection.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.16,Our Key Strengths,5.16.4,A Consumer-Centric Approach at the Core of our Business,"Our collection rate is dependent on our ability to both understand consumers and to treat them fairly and with respect. We believe that by treating our consumers in this manner, and by ensuring regulatory compliance and maintaining a strong risk management discipline within our Group, we are able to maintain and foster a positive reputation. We believe that having a positive reputation is a key factor to our success as a debt servicing company. Our UK Division has received numerous accolades for its strong track record with respect to the quality of its customer service. Our UK Division has received a number of awards from Investors in Customers (“IIC”), a UK customer-experience consultancy, including a “Gold Award” in 2017 (previous “star” ratings have been replaced with bronze, silver and gold awards and we were the first company to receive the Gold Award), a “Gold for Investors in Customers” in 2018, “Debt Purchase Provider of the Year” in 2019 and “Best Use of Technology” for our roll out of Robotic Process Automation in 2019. Our UK Division also benefits from a Trustpilot (a consumer review website) rating of 4.4/5 stars. Our DACH Division has also been recognized for its consumer service. According to a 2018 report, we held the highest S&P Servicer Rating level for German CMS providers. Our Northern European Division has also been recognized for its commitment to consumer service, and in 2019, Lowell Norway won “The CX Mover: Best implementation – Time to achieve value” at the world’s largest conference for contact centers and customer experiences in Denver, Colorado, USA. These achievements are a product of our focus on risk management. Our risk management framework is grounded in our management structure, our processes and a “three lines of defense” risk-management (see “Our _Group’s Business—Compliance and Risk Management” for a description of the “three lines of defense” model)_ that we believe mirrors the highest risk-management standards in the CMS industry. Compliance is at the heart of our Group’s operations. We believe that we have a strong track record with respect to consumer complaints in all the geographies we operate in. For example, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the FOS-filed complaint ratio in our UK Division was 11.9 cases filed per one million active financial services accounts. In our DACH Division, we received, on average, 0.01% consumer complaints as a percentage of active accounts for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. In our Northern European Division, we received, on average, 0.003% consumer complaints as a percentage of active accounts for the twelve months ----- ended June 30, 2020. A focus on risk management and compliance are woven into our Group’s structure from the local level to the internal and independent external risk control and auditing functions carried out at the executive and board levels. We believe the decision science that underlies our Group’s collection techniques contributes to our ability to manage compliance and reputational risk. We further believe that our focus on and extensive experience in compliance and risk management resonate well with debt originators and provide us with a competitive advantage in the UK, DACH and Northern European regulatory environments, which, though different in their particular legal frameworks and regulations, are similarly designed, robust and stable. It is our view that the well-developed nature of such environments provides us with a competitive advantage and favors strong market participants, such as our Group, which has the scale and experience necessary to meet demanding compliance requirements. Our Group has an overarching commitment to be a fair and principled business that puts people at the heart of the culture, particularly our consumers. This shared values-based approach is central to our integration and provide consistency to our vision of being the best in our field.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.16,Our Key Strengths,5.16.5,Competitive Advantage Embedded in Sophisticated Data Analytics,"The Group has invested, and continues to invest, in what we believe to be industry-leading IT and data platforms in our markets. Through our consumer data, which we believe to also be industry-leading, we have developed proprietary behavioral and asset valuation models, custom software applications and a variety of other business tools. The Group’s systems are technologically sophisticated, highly automated and driven by data derived from databases of owned and serviced debt portfolios in the markets in which we operate, and we believe that our Group has the largest databases in the UK and DACH and one of the largest datasets in Northern Europe. State of the art data science techniques serve as an integral part in the process of pricing portfolios ahead of acquisitions and allow the business to establish more efficient debt, consumer and customer engagement strategies. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s systems held data derived from some 4,281 owned debt portfolios, of which there were 22.2 million active accounts. We believe that our data systems benefit from a virtuous circle that further strengthens our informational advantage relative to that of our competitors. In our experience, the more debt portfolios we service or purchase, the more data and collection experience we derive and the more accurate our tracing and pricing systems become. We also believe that our systems’ increasing sophistication has the additional benefit of making them increasingly difficult to replicate. Thus, given the breadth of our experience throughout the credit management value chain, we have access to comprehensive databases of purchased and serviced debt. Our IT and data platforms are subject to an ongoing process of improvement and innovation, which we support with ongoing investment. We believe that our sophisticated and scalable IT and data platforms, in which we have made robust investments, provide significant competitive advantages. Combined with our decision science capabilities, we are able to take a centralized approach to forecasting and pricing that is supported by specialist local input, ensuring strong cross-organizational evaluation of portfolio pricing. In our experience, our automated pricing models and tracing systems have helped to increase the accuracy with which we price both owned debt portfolios and third-party collection service contracts, thereby increasing our chance to win a bid at the right price while reducing our downside risk on the owned debt portfolio or signed contract. The Group’s data capabilities combined with lean operational processes also facilitate more efficient and effective debt collection strategies through robotics, data science and cross-learning. In addition, the risk management approach of the Group helps to ensure that the sophisticated pricing information is used in an investment decision-making context that focuses on compliance and maintaining strong internal controls. We believe that our sophisticated collection strategies and approach to a digital enabled business, in turn, lead to increased collection efficiency and reduced collection costs. Further, we believe our sophisticated IT and data platforms allows us to compete effectively in sectors in which our peers struggle to generate sufficient returns, in particular in low-balance sectors such as retail, telecommunications and utilities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.16,Our Key Strengths,5.16.6,Strong Track Record of Return on Capital and Portfolio Pricing Through the Cycle,"We believe that we have a track record of strong and stable return on capital supported by continuous improvement in decision science and the use of feedback from our collection operations. The Group’s aggregate Gross Money Multiple on portfolios purchased as of June 30, 2020 was 2.6x in our UK Division, 3.2x in our DACH Division and 2.5x in the Northern European Division. Moreover, since Group management is involved in investment decisions at each division, we believe that we are able to deploy our capital across the UK, DACH and Northern European regions to wherever returns are most promising, which we believe contributes to our ability ----- to maintain high returns on capital. We believe that continuous improvement in decision science and leveraging feedback from collection operations have helped strengthen our underwriting, resulting in a narrower disparity between forecasted and actual returns. Our historical actual collections compared to forecast collections demonstrate our accurate and disciplined yet prudent forecasting. We have steadily met or exceeded our forecasted collections, even during more challenging economic environments. For example, following the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis, our UK predecessor company’s actual collections exceeded forecasts, with actual collections on the December 31, 2008 static pool reaching 104% of forecasted collections by June 2020. Our Group’s actual Gross Debt Purchase Collections on portfolios owned by the Group as of December 31 of the prior year (the “static pool”) were 103% of our forecasted collections for the year ended December 31, 2018, 104% of our forecasted collections for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 94% of our forecasted collections for the six months ended June 30, 2020, and we have met or outperformed our forecasted collections on the static pool each year between 2007 and 2019. We believe that our disciplined approach to portfolio pricing has helped us avoid overbidding on debt portfolios. Our portfolio pricing process begins with a rigorous and extensive due diligence and valuation exercise, which may involve, among other things, building a synthetic debt portfolio with actual performance data and similar consumer characteristics and performing on-site file testing to assess the underlying quality of the debt portfolio before submitting our final bid. Our due diligence and valuation methods benefit from the market-leading scale of our data, our sophisticated and automated data systems and our experienced and skilled portfolio pricing specialists. Our ability to leverage our own data and our specific expertise and databases from comparable portfolios across many sectors minimizes risk and helps to ensure accurate pricing bolstered by strong in-house analytical capabilities. Upon the successful completion of due diligence, a debt portfolio is subject to a clear and systematic internal review and approval process culminating in a decision to either approve or reject the proposed portfolio investment. Our disciplined capital deployment and selectivity with respect to portfolio purchases has helped us achieve an IRR with respect to our portfolio purchases of 19% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 16% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.16,Our Key Strengths,5.16.7,High Visibility into Future Cash Flow Generation,"Our debt portfolio purchase business provides excellent visibility into future earnings, as well as substantial cash-flow generation backed by a significant asset base. Although the Group’s ERC metrics extend for up to 180 months, depending on the division, a majority of collections occur within the first 48 months. As of June 30, 2020, we expected approximately 34% of our 120M ERC to be collected within the next 24 months and approximately 58% to be collected within the 48-month period. As of June 30, 2020, the Group had 4,281 owned debt portfolios and 120M ERC was £3,466.1 million, resulting in an aggregate Gross Money Multiple on portfolios purchased of 2.6x for our UK Division, 3.2x for our DACH Division and 2.5x for the Northern European Division. We believe we take a cautious approach to repayment by attempting to establish recurring payment methods with lower rates of default, such as direct debits and continuous payment authorizations on debit and credit cards. In addition, we believe that the multi-year nature of our forward flow agreements helps to provide us with visibility into new business origination and expected returns. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 55% of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases came from forward flow agreements. Similarly, forward flow agreements accounted for 55% and 67% of portfolio purchases in the DACH Division and Northern European Division respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. In addition, we made £351.1 million of portfolio purchases for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and believe that our significant asset base of owned debt portfolios is capable of continuing to yield predictable cash flows. We believe that our ERC forecast is reliable and resilient, as a significant portion of the payments on our portfolios are made through long-term payment plans. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 long term payment plans as a percentage of collections was 80% in the UK Division, 40% in the DACH Division and 24% in the Northern European Division. Our third-party collection services business is also cash generative and typically enables us to scale our business without requiring significant incremental investments. We believe that the contractual arrangements in the third-party collection services business, which are both stable and of increasing durations (notably for contracts with large, well-known clients), provide visibility into future collections, the fees we derive from them as well as associated cash-flow generation. Our income from 3PC services was £169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £158.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019 income from 3PC services represented 17.8% of Group cash income and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 income from 3PC services represented 17.1% of Group cash income. ----- Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA was £496.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and £512.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, and 120M ERC was £3,466.1 million as of June 30, 2020. Our Group cash income, gross profit, and Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA each increased between the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020.

To maintain and enhance this individualized approach to our consumers, we intend to continue to leverage our decision science capabilities in order to help ensure that the consumer profiles we build are as accurate and up-to-date as possible. We aim to communicate closely, clearly and transparently with the consumer and strive to understand their situation and circumstances. We believe that clear communication will enable us to have visibility with regard to the timing and profile of future collections. As the legal and regulatory environments in which we operate continue to evolve, we intend to adapt our culture, practices and policies appropriately, while always seeking to be the model that others look to for compliance standards and best practices.

We also intend to further diversify our one-stop service offering by capitalizing on the Northern European Division’s value-added services offering. Moreover, we have a strong track record of opening new sectors to the CMS market, such as entering into the telecommunications and utilities market in the UK, and we seek to continue to build relationships with entities ----- that have not previously sold debt portfolios or purchased CMS services. Our geographic diversity has positioned us to fully leverage our geographic footprint by launching products which have been successful in one market into our other markets.

We believe that we have a complementary set of competitive advantages across the UK, DACH and Northern European regions that are essential to helping us achieve this objective. Our UK Division is a leader in the UK CMS market and possesses one of the most sophisticated debt purchase platforms in Europe. Our DACH Division is a leading player in the DACH debt purchase and third-party collection services markets and provides our clients with a diversified service offering that harnesses our expertise in a range of CMS services, including BPO and risk-management services. Our Northern European Division also has a leading position in the Northern European CMS market, including BPO and risk-management services in the Northern European financial institutions client segment that possesses one of the most sophisticated debt purchasing and collection platforms in the data-rich Northern European region.

In such a scenario, coinvestment structures are opportunities for the Group to gain access to larger portfolios and build scale through our ability to source, price and service unsecured consumer finance portfolios. We believe this will contribute to an increase of the revenue from third-party servicing and help to better manage the Group’s financial profile by adjusting exposure and overall allocation. In order to partner with well-established co-investors, the investors must be confident that we are able to service the portfolio in an efficient and professional manner without any conflict of interest or principal-agent problems. We believe the ability to transact with established investors creates a unique advantage for the Group: - Expand purchasing capacity – ability to participate in larger deals across our markets with less capital intensity; - Higher returns – opportunity to leverage servicing platforms (acting as servicer of portfolios) and gain scale; and - Lower risk – ability to manage the risk versus return by adjusting own exposure depending on market WACC and desired overall allocation, regardless of transaction sizes. In January 2020, we entered into an NPL purchase agreement with German private bank Oldenburgische Landesbank (OLB). Under the terms of the arrangement, we will procure NPLs in the DACH region for OLB, up to an amount of €30 million per year. We will carry out debt collections and servicing on all debt portfolios through a master servicing agreement, which will provide a new stream of future servicing income.

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.17,Our Strategy,5.17.7,Strong Focus on Leverage and Funding Diversification,"Prudent capital management is at the center of our financial policy. We organically reduced the Group’s consolidated total net leverage ratio to 4.7x as of June 30, 2020, a decrease of 0.4x since June 30, 2019, on the back of better front book returns and overall margin improvement driven by strong cost control and slower overall spend. The consummation of the Transactions is expected to further reduce overall leverage of the Group as of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, to a consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.6x. Due to our decision to temporarily pause new litigation activity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect our Gross Debt Purchase Collections in 2020 to fall short of previous estimates and, notwithstanding COVID-19 related cost reduction measures, we expect Group Adjusted Cash EBITDA to slightly decline in the year ending December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and, as a consequence, total net leverage to increase slightly during this period. See _“—Recent Developments—COVID-19.” However, we expect the reduction in overall leverage to continue as we_ remain committed to our publicly stated leverage guidance of a consolidated total net leverage ratio in the range of 4.0x to 3.5x by 2021-2022. Our deleveraging targets assume resumption of UK litigation activity from H2 2020 onwards and no further forbearance measures (either voluntary or government-imposed) in any of our regions. While we believe our stated leverage guidance to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information and this information may not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of the financial year or any future period. See “Forward-Looking Statements.” ----- In addition, the Group is actively exploring alternative ways to fund growth. Recent examples include our focus on growing our relatively less capital intense servicing segment and pursuing co-investment structure opportunities, including our recent co-investment partnership with a listed global asset manager, which has targeted deployments of €300 million to purchase non-performing loan portfolios over the next three years, as well as a partnership with a bank managing over €20 billion in assets to carry out debt collections and servicing on all owned debt portfolios. See “—Our Strategy—Enter into Strategic Partnerships with Reputable Investors _and Financial Institutions.”_ As our pipeline of potential investment opportunities continues to outpace our on-balance sheet investment capacity, co-investment structures present opportunities for the Group to access larger portfolios and build scale by capitalizing on our ability to source, price and service unsecured consumer finance portfolios. We expect this to drive increasing income from third-party servicing and to help better manage the Group’s financial profile by improving the composition of our portfolio exposures and allocations. The ability to transact with established investors presents a unique opportunity for the Group to (i) expand our purchasing capacity and our ability to participate in larger deals across geographies with less capital intensity, (ii) generate higher returns and create further opportunities to leverage our servicing platforms and gain scale and (iii) improve our risk/return management and profile by adjusting our exposures depending on market WACC and desired allocation mix regardless of transaction sizes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Furthermore, the Group has a proven track record of successfully expanding by acquiring carve-outs of the internal collections businesses of banks, insurers, telecoms and utility companies. In July 2020, we announced the acquisition of Solvencia AS, which we believe will establish us as a leading 3PC player in Norway, strengthen our 3PC business in Sweden and Finland and build up our Northern European Division’s capability to collect small balance debts in Norway. The acquisition closed on October 1, 2020. As our business continues to develop, we intend to continue to participate opportunistically in the consolidation of the European CMS industry in order to build scale, address untapped consumer segments and create new relationships with debt originators. We intend to strategically pursue further carve-out transactions with current clients and credit-accretive bolt-on acquisitions.

The majority of debt portfolios are currently offered to the market through spot sales featuring a competitive tender process, which typically involves three or four debt purchasers selected by the client. These auctions may be managed directly by the vendor or may be facilitated by an intermediary, such as a leading advisory firm. Other spot sales channels include, for example, an increasingly common bilateral process in which a debt portfolio is offered to a single purchaser on an exclusive basis. Furthermore, we have entered into forward flow agreements with a number of top debt originators, pursuant to which we have purchased all or substantially all of such debt originators’ debt sales, subject to pre-agreed criteria. We generally enter into forward flow agreements through a competitive bidding process and renew such agreements on a bilateral basis. See “—Debt Portfolio Purchase— _Types of Debt Purchase Agreements—Forward flow agreements.” To facilitate our portfolio purchases, we_ maintain a live sales tracker with data on up to twelve months of forecast debt portfolio sales in the UK market, including estimates of face value, number of accounts, debt type, pricing and timing of individual acquisition opportunities. This tracker allows our executive team to actively pursue opportunities and tailor our strategy to changing conditions. This rolling twelve-month forecast is reviewed by our sales team on a weekly basis and enables us to monitor the progress of our debt portfolio purchases throughout the relevant financial year. _Our DACH Division’s Debt Portfolio Origination_ Our DACH Division has been active in the DACH region debt purchase market since 2003 and, as of June 30, 2020, had purchased 562 debt portfolios, consisting of approximately 4.1 million active accounts, for cumulative portfolio purchases of €664.3 million (£605.9 million) and an aggregate face value at time of purchase of €6.4 billion (£5.8 billion). We acquire debt portfolios in the DACH region through spot sales and forward flow agreements, each of which can be transacted by way of market debt tender or off-market sales. We believe we are invited to most major market debt tender processes in the German market. In a typical off-market sale, we are one of a limited number of purchasers in the DACH region engaged in discussions with a debt originator. In these situations, we have the opportunity to negotiate the content of the portfolio acquired and can work with the debt originator to agree on terms that maximize target outcomes for both parties. Our specialized sales teams maintain close relationships with debt originators and leverage those relationships, along with our strong reputation in the debt collection market of the DACH region, to win new business and thus to originate new portfolios. _Our Northern European Division’s Debt Portfolio Origination_ Our Northern European Division has been active in the Northern European debt purchase market since 2003 and, as of June 30, 2020, had purchased 1,246 debt portfolios, consisting of approximately 2.3 million active accounts, for cumulative portfolio purchases of €1,181.1 million (£1,077.1 million) and an aggregate face value at time of purchase of approximately €6.1 billion (£5.6 billion). The majority of portfolios for sale are currently offered to the market through competitive tender processes, although the Northern European Division also engages its clients in discussions to purchase portfolios through bilateral negotiations whenever opportunities arise. A key driver of our success in debt purchasing has been our ability to leverage relationships with clients for whom we collect debt through outsourcing contracts. Our local sales teams maintain close relationships with key debt originators in the countries where we operate. In addition, our senior management maintains close relationships on a cross-border level with major key debt originators and is actively involved in their largest transactions with these sellers. Through these relationships, the Northern European Division often receives requests for proposals in relation to the portfolios for sale. We believe that we are uniquely situated in the UK, DACH region and Northern European markets in terms of the proportion of debt portfolios that each acquires pursuant to forward flow agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.21,Debt Purchase,5.21.2,Debt Portfolio Purchase,"_Our UK Division’s Debt Portfolio Purchasing_ In the UK, a debt portfolio vendor will supply interested parties with a tender document that includes debt portfolio information at an account level, which in our experience is often stale and incomplete. Our automated portfolio pricing models and tracing systems, along with our significant track record with debt originators, provide us with the ability to evaluate a debt portfolio for sale in great detail before we make a decision to purchase. With what we believe to be the largest consumer database in the UK CMS market and efficient tracing capabilities, we are able to supplement the information provided by the debt originator to improve our analysis of the portfolio. The high crossover rate of accounts between sectors further improves our tracing capabilities and increases the amount of consumer data we have available to inform our pricing decisions in the UK. Given the size of the reference database on our backbook, we have been able to carry out significant statistical analyses to ----- determine the key variables that drive collection performance on consumer accounts. See “—Decision Science— _Our UK Division’s Decision Science.” We develop detailed collection curves and cost curves for a new debt_ portfolio to determine a maximum price to bid, which often includes benchmarking the characteristics of the debt portfolio’s consumer base against similar debt portfolios we purchased. We also build synthetic debt portfolios with actual performance data and consumer characteristics similar to those of the portfolio being considered. These methods allow us to make a detailed pricing recommendation to our UK Division Investment Committee, which will determine our final bid price. Due to our reputation and experience, we are invited to bid on a large proportion of debt sold in the UK market. _Our DACH Division’s Debt Portfolio Purchasing_ Prior to acquiring a debt portfolio, we evaluate the purchase opportunity through a multi-stage process generally consisting of two rounds of bidding, an indicative bid and a final bid, along with extensive due diligence throughout the process. As part of our due diligence, we receive both consumer information (e.g., gender, age and address) and receivables information (e.g., outstanding principal balance, interest and fees due, claim size and payment history information). If the debt originator accepts our indicative bid, it will then typically provide us with additional information on the portfolio, allowing us to perform a more complete review to determine the underlying quality of the portfolio. In this second phase of due diligence, we typically perform a detailed on-site assessment of the portfolio’s value. In both the indicative and final bid stages, we use historical payment and reference portfolio analyses to determine a potential price that represents the discounted value of estimated cash flows net of costs. Our governance process with regard to new investments depends on the total amount to be invested. _Our Northern European Division’s Debt Portfolio Purchasing_ The Northern European Division has extensive experience in acquiring portfolios of overdue loans and other overdue receivables at attractive prices. We generate revenue after purchasing portfolios by applying our collection process and approach to optimize the cash collected and thereby generating a proven track record of attractive returns on the investments. We believe that the Northern European Division can generate attractive yields over the life of the portfolios due to our expertise in pricing unsecured consumer NPLs, knowledge of the portfolios we purchase and our debt collection abilities. Among the investment criteria that the Northern European Division considers is the portfolio’s expected return and whether we match our strict pricing discipline to maintain high portfolio returns and avoid overbidding. We believe that one of the Northern European Division’s core strengths is that we typically service the portfolios we purchase in-house. In this way, we control the entire debt collection process and are able to implement optimal debt collection strategies as well as ensure that customers are treated fairly and with respect. We believe that the efficient, fair and respectful manner in which the Northern European Division conducts its business upon purchasing a portfolio is evident through its many long-standing client relationships. _Types of Debt Purchase Agreements_ In the UK, DACH and Northern Europe we purchase debt portfolios pursuant to two types of arrangements: spot sales and forward flow agreements. - **Spot sales. We purchase debt portfolios through “spot” agreements, the terms of which are individually negotiated on a case-by-case basis. A spot agreement generally relates to a single portfolio. In the UK, spot sales may be conducted through auctions or bilateral sales. In Germany, spot sales are mostly conducted through auctions. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, spot agreements accounted for approximately 45% of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases (£210.9 million in total), approximately 45% of our DACH Division’s portfolio purchases (€78.3 million (£68.5 million) in total) and 34% of our Northern European Division’s portfolio purchases (€82.0 million (£71.7 million) in total). See “Industry and Market Data—Debt Purchasing—Methods of _Debt Sale—Spot sale.”_ - **Forward flow agreements. A forward flow agreement is an agreement to buy several portfolios over a period of time at a predetermined pricing mechanism, specified credit quality and point in the debt recovery cycle. We have entered into forward flow agreements with a number of top debt originators. From our UK Division’s Start Date (June 1, 2004) to June 30, 2020, 43% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements and agreements that were a mixture of a forward flow agreement with a spot purchase. From our DACH Division’s Start Date ----- (September 30, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 48% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements. From our Northern European Division’s Start Date (January 1, 2003) to June 30, 2020, 31% of its portfolio purchases were made pursuant to forward flow agreements. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, forward flow agreements accounted for approximately 55% of our UK Division’s portfolio purchases, approximately 55% of our DACH Division’s portfolio purchases and approximately 67% of our Northern European Division’s portfolio purchases, representing approximately £115.8 million, €43.0 million (£37.6 million) and €63.5 million (£47.6 million) in portfolio purchases, respectively. Forward flow agreements enable us to benefit from tailored, long-term and continuous debt purchase arrangements. The long-term nature of forward flow agreements, combined with the ongoing debt originator relationships that result from them, provide us with visibility as to purchase volumes and expected returns. In addition, we are able to adjust the price of certain new debt portfolios we purchase in the UK over the duration of a forward flow agreement in accordance with the performance of previously purchased portfolios, the quality of debt in the new portfolio and our current forecasts, which are derived from models mutually agreed between the debt originator and us. Moreover, debt in portfolios acquired pursuant to forward flow agreements tends to be “fresher” than debt in portfolios sold by other means because there is less of a delay between when the debt is considered defaulted and when we can begin collections. As a general rule, the “fresher” the debt, the higher our collection expectations, since customers’ willingness to engage with us and repay typically decays over time following a default. See “Industry and Market Data—Methods of Debt Sale—Forward flow agreement.” In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, more than 57% of our portfolio purchases were the result of forward flow agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

We are able to load the portfolio onto our system and run the related processes within a reasonable timeframe by analyzing and tracing millions of accounts. This avoids the need to reach out indiscriminately to all accounts, which would increase costs. We tailor our approach and focus on the consumer accounts that we believe have the greatest propensity to pay. For further information, see “—Decision Science— _Our UK Division’s Decision Science.” Our DACH Division’s Debt Portfolio Segmentation and Strategy_ Upon receipt of a consumer’s account file in our DACH Division, we “onboard,” or integrate, it into our DACH Division’s databases. Throughout the collection process, we retrieve additional consumer data via our external data providers, leveraging best-of-breed data providers in the areas of credit information, address data and telephone numbers. Our highly automated operating platform allows us to onboard a significant amount of new accounts in our DACH Division, and we currently onboard more than one million new accounts each year. As of June 30, 2020, our DACH Division had serviced in total 27.6 million accounts and had collected information on 28.6 million consumers, including consumers from both 3PC serviced accounts and accounts in our owned debt portfolios. This information allows us to more accurately determine collection strategies. For further information, see “—Decision Science—Our DACH Division’s Decision Science.” _Our Northern European Division’s Debt Portfolio Segmentation and Strategy_ After acquiring a portfolio, our Northern European Division typically manages the portfolio in-house. Our Northern European Division has a deep understanding of the debt collection process, which enables us to tailor approaches for each customer and to determine whether we can offer additional value to customers through a variety of collection methods. By servicing owned debt portfolios in-house, we are also able to provide stability and scale to the debt collection segment of our business, which allows us to improve and enhance our debt collection methods.

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.22,Collection Process,5.22.1,Our UK Division’s Collection Process,"Our UK Division’s approach to collections is focused on delivering the optimum return on capital employed by minimizing cost versus collection potential. Contacting consumers with the highest propensity to pay is key to minimizing servicing costs and optimizing returns. Between June 1, 2004 and June 30, 2020, we have needed to collect from only 29% of our UK consumer accounts in order to achieve returns. To achieve this result, we use a sophisticated statistical analysis of extensive consumer information and empirical collections data designed to match the right strategy to the right consumer at the right time. Our approach to consumers is based on obtaining an accurate understanding of their financial circumstances and is designed to identify repayment options that achieve a beneficial outcome both for us and for the consumer, in order to foster a positive relationship and reduce the frequency of complaints. This data-driven approach is supported by a technologically advanced and highly automated collections platform and implemented via a multi-channel contact strategy that utilizes call-center contact, letters, text messages and emails. Accounts determined to have the highest propensity to pay are treated with a specific letter and out-bound dialer strategy designed for such accounts. Less collectable accounts are treated with different strategies that are tailored to the consumer’s financial circumstances and our business’s capacity and desire to deploy the required resources. - **Letter strategies. All letters are drafted in a consumer-friendly format designed to encourage consumers to contact the call center. The collaborative tone of each letter is designed to engender engagement. The approach of each letter is tailored to each consumer and determined by debt portfolio segmentation during the book-on process. - **Dialer strategy. Predictive dialing is a key component of our UK Division call-center strategy, allowing numerous calls to be queued simultaneously and allocated to available representatives. Our telephony system and fully automated, predictive dialer have benefited from a significant level of investment. Key features of our telephony system and dialer include: - the use of a blended in-bound and out-bound dialer with the ability to prioritize valuable inbound calls; - the ability to automatically select and sort consumer records based on scoring and segmentation parameters; - the ability to screen answer machines and unanswered calls to help ensure that representatives maximize time spent speaking to consumers; - the ability to capture telephone numbers and time of day at which previous calls have been successful for reference when each account is recycled through the dialer; and - the ability to route calls to representatives based on defined capability and priority parameters (such as debt type). Increasingly, we are investing in web, email, SMS and mobile applications to contact consumers in the UK and allow them to communicate and pay through their preferred method of payment. When a UK consumer engages with us by contacting a representative in our call center, the representative who is responsible for adherence to compliance requirements has a full view of established payment plans (if already set up by the consumer), and benefits from the use of daily-updated information about movements in a consumer’s file. Collections performance is monitored at an account level on a daily basis using automated reports detailing monies received in the month to date, forecast collections for the remainder of the month and expected variances from targets by debt portfolio. We also have access to a wide range of management reports on a realtime basis and individual account details, using our business intelligence reporting software. This ability to access information on a flexible, efficient and immediate basis is critical to allow management to design, implement and, when required, change collection strategies on existing portfolios and pricing strategies on prospective portfolio purchases. This also allows management to optimize value and protect returns on the debt portfolios that we own. Our UK Division consumers’ default rate was 5.33% as of June 30, 2020, compared to 6.63% as of June 30, 2019, ----- in each case based on a three-month average. The default rate is calculated as the percentage of payment plans which made no payments in the month a payment was due. With the launch of Lowell Solicitors in October 2015, our UK Division’s litigation services subsidiary, we have leveraged their experience and expertise to pursue and develop a litigation collection process for collection on our debt purchase portfolios in the UK. By bringing what was previously an outsourced process into our operations, we believe we will enhance our ability to monitor and direct each step of the litigation process. We believe that having a litigation capability in-house enables us to provide a more seamless experience for our consumers, implement a more efficient process that will generate commercial efficiencies for investors and improve the visibility of our control and oversight over the end-to-end collection process for our clients. In certain situations, (e.g., when specialist collection skills may be required), we outsource some of our UK accounts to third-party agents. Outsourced collections represented 17% of our UK Division’s Gross Debt Purchase Collections for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Our UK Division engages DCAs either to selectively benchmark our own performance or when the defaulted debt requires highly specialized attention and is less cost-effective for us to pursue directly. DCAs selected to work on our behalf are subject to a stringent due diligence process. To ensure that regulatory and compliance standards are maintained, we further maintain a program of regular audits of the third-party DCAs we employ, which include telephone questionnaires and onsite audits during which we examine account activity and monitor live calls.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.22,Collection Process,5.22.2,Our DACH Division’s Collection Process,"In the DACH region, the unsecured consumer credit recovery cycle typically has three stages, the characteristics of which may differ depending on factors such as collection activities already taken by the debt originator or whether there is a fixed payment date. The three stages are: (1) ongoing accounts CMS on performing loans and/or debt outstanding; (2) early-stage recoveries for unpaid debt within 45 days (or, in the case of receivables sourced from the financial services industry, generally 90 days) after the payment due date for debt that specifies a payment date; and (3) ongoing debt collection activities for defaulted debt beyond the 45-day (or, in the case of receivables sourced from the financial services industry, generally 90-day) early-stage recovery period. Ongoing accounts CMS is typically handled in-house, whereas debt collection services are typically outsourced to third-party providers at the early-stage recovery phase and in the ongoing collection phase. Our products and services in the DACH region cover the full debt recovery cycle and, in some instances, risk management solutions implemented prior to the origination of debt, enabling us to benefit from a longer servicing period. We believe that we also benefit from the fact that we service our owned debt portfolios through one of our servicing subsidiaries. In doing so, we control the entire debt collection process, are able to implement optimal third-party collection strategies and benefit from the scale of our collections operations. Optimizing consumer contact at each stage of the collection life cycle is the key to our collection strategy. We adapt our procedures to maximize the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach rather than by exploiting short-term collection potential. The process consists of the following key phases: (1) the pre-legal or “amicable” phase; (2) the legal phase; and (3) the long-term monitoring phase. During this process, our DACH Division has the potential to earn fees on collections by passing through statutory fees to the consumer and earning contractually based success fees, generally during the long-term monitoring phase, from debt originators. - **Pre-legal or “amicable” phase. During the pre-legal phase, our goal is to agree to a voluntary payment plan or settlement with the consumer. Any repayment arrangements with consumers are structured in accordance with specific internal policy guidelines and debt originator contract requirements, if applicable, and are designed to be sustainable and affordable for the consumer. To enhance efficiency during the collection process, we leverage the centralized core debt management systems of our DACH Division and the information in our extensive databases in order to swiftly assess a consumer’s ability to pay and tailor an optimal collection strategy for each individual consumer. Ultimately, the combination of collection methods that we use for a specific debt originator depends on various factors, including the claim size, the debt originator we are acting on behalf of, applicable laws and regulations, and the individual consumer. In general, one or two days following onboarding, our DACH Division makes initial contact with the consumer by means of a “hello” letter. If, after a maximum of one month, the consumer has not repaid or demonstrated his or her willingness to repay the outstanding balance, we will begin to send escalation letters to the consumer, which include tailored messages and are often sent by third-party law firms engaged by us. ----- Beginning at the end of 2016, we have begun preparations to reduce our use of third-party law firms and have started to transfer certain of these functions in-house. Throughout this phase, our DACH Division’s call center personnel will contact the consumer to assess his or her willingness and ability to pay for purposes of performing an income-expenditure assessment. Our three industrialized and automated call centers, with a total of 175 agents, made 70 calls per agent per day in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. In addition to calling consumers, we have also started sending text messages to consumers with a request to call back and have realized a higher callback rate through text messages than through standard voicemail messages. Whether a voluntary payment plan or settlement is agreed with the consumer depends on the results of our income-expenditure assessment (i.e., the evaluation of a consumer’s willingness and ability to pay), and on any restrictions the debt originator may have placed on us. - **Legal phase. Typically, three weeks after sending the escalation letters, legal action can be initiated on claims that have not been repaid or settled. A claim moves into the legal phase if we determine that the consumer has the ability to pay but is otherwise unwilling to voluntarily pay, or if we have been unable to agree to a solution with the consumer in the pre-legal phase. While we aim to resolve claims by working with consumers without relying on legal enforcement, we will employ legal methods if we believe that this is the optimal strategy and if the economics of the legal proceedings are attractive to us. Examples of solutions we seek in the legal phase include garnishment of wages, sale of collateral, bankruptcy proceedings and debt restructuring. When legal action is taken, litigation costs are paid for by the consumer if the court decision is in the creditor’s favor. Prior to taking legal action, we determine whether a particular account is suitable for court action based on a variety of factors. We assess available information about the consumer from credit bureaus, including the consumer’s credit score and any “negative entries” showing that the consumer is vulnerable or does not have the ability to pay. If there are negative entries indicating that legal action is inappropriate, we will transfer the account to the long-term monitoring phase and continue to monitor it on a regular basis for any changes to the consumer’s personal and/or financial circumstances. If we determine that a consumer’s account is suitable for legal action, then we will seek a judicial order to pay. Our processing capabilities are enhanced by our service center, a centralized, automated hub for managing mail, digitizing German consumer files and physically archiving court documents. - **Long-term monitoring phase. The long-term monitoring phase typically commences when a claim is written off due to the consumer’s being insolvent and/or the claim being deemed uncollectable. If we have obtained enforcement title to the claim, this phase can last up to 30 years. During this phase, we monitor changes in the circumstances of the individual consumer in order to determine whether its ability to begin payment has been enhanced. When it appears through surveillance that a consumer’s financial position has improved, we then look to both pre-legal and legal means to collect on the claim. We have a strong track record of collecting on older claims in our owned debt portfolios. We undertake substantially the same collection process in both our third-party collection services for external clients and in collecting on our owned debt portfolios. However, when we perform third-party collection services on behalf of our clients, we typically operate within our own guidelines regarding settlements, as well as according to specific collections procedures. For our owned debt portfolios, we generally have the flexibility to set guidelines regarding when to settle a claim and what procedures are utilized, subject to any contractual limitations or other arrangements with the relevant debt originator. For example, we are typically restricted from deploying contractors who physically visit consumers’ homes. Actions taken during the collection process are designed to take into account any restrictions imposed by applicable laws and regulations, and to preserve our and our clients’ reputation.

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.22,Collection Process,5.22.3,Our Northern European Division’s Collection Process,"The Northern European Division engages in an extensive valuation of any given portfolio in order to determine what price we should offer the client. First, we look at certain characteristics, including the age of the claims in the portfolio, the size of the portfolio, the type of receivable the portfolio contains and the collection process already undertaken in order to determine whether the portfolio is suitable. Once we have determined that a portfolio for sale is suitable, we collaborate with our debt collection team and engage in an extensive valuation ----- of the portfolio. The Northern European Division uses multiple valuation methods and takes into account, among other factors, the below analyses: - _Vintage analysis, where we use historical cash flow information to forecast future returns; - _Production models, where we analyze the portfolio and makes assumptions on conversion rates and average payment levels using benchmark portfolios built on the basis of millions of data points, customer information and the historical performance of its current portfolios; - _Debt profiles, where we identify the key value drivers in the portfolio, segment the portfolio based on these key value drivers and evaluate the total likely recovery for each claim; - _Scorecards, using all available data (internal, external and data from portfolio vendors) to evaluate the propensity of each customer in the portfolio to pay and to what amount; and - _Paying books, where we identify different payment profiles and segment accounts based on historical payment behavior. The emphasis we place on each valuation method depends on the specific circumstances, information available and characteristics of the portfolio for sale. In conjunction with the valuation process, the Northern European Division also performs due diligence on the portfolio prior to making a final bid. The purpose of this due diligence process is to identify any areas of risk that would impact our ability to successfully manage the portfolio following its purchase. As part of the due diligence process, we request and work to verify certain data fields, including claim balances, payment history on claims, details of credit agreements and legal enforceability. Additionally, we undertake a detailed review of the assumptions that were applied as part of the valuation process and determine whether those assumptions need to be adjusted. For certain transactions, we also engage external advisors for this process. We seek to leverage our relationships with clients to assist them with this process by obtaining guidance on pricing, where possible. We believe that the Northern European Division has a competitive advantage when it is invited to bid on a portfolio that it performs debt collection on, because we are able to accurately assess the potential in the portfolio that can be generated given our familiarity with the debt collection measures that have been undertaken, allowing us to accurately price the portfolio. This results in being able to confidently offer an appealing value proposition to clients, which makes us a strong contender for portfolios that we find attractive. Depending on the size of the transaction, the assessment and final pricing of a portfolio involves input from the Northern European Division’s country-level management and operations, our debt purchasing and debt collection teams, IT team and senior executives. This group works together to use the information gathered in the process to prepare the final bid, and the relevant country level team uses its knowledge and expertise to provide a current and accurate reflection on the competitive environment in order to ensure that any final bid is aligned with the Group return requirement and competing offers the client is likely to receive. The final bid is determined based on an analysis of various scenarios, which are designed to test our models at the high and low ends of prior experience, and is evaluated and approved by pre-defined levels of management, depending on the size of the bid. The final price that we offer for a portfolio takes into account the return that we require to compensate for the risk present in the transaction, the possibility that actual performance of the portfolio may deviate from the expected performance and the level of competition that we face in the market. A key driver of the Northern European Division’s success in debt purchasing is the ability to leverage relationships with clients. These relationships can also be used to propose alternative structures to those that were requested if we believe this will create value for us and the client. We also frequently receive a “first and last look opportunity” at a portfolio due to these pre-existing relationships. After purchasing a portfolio, if the Northern European Division does not already perform debt collection on the purchased portfolio, we must ensure that claim balances are accurately recorded, funds paid between the determination date and the closing date by customers are received, and customers are diverted to the appropriate phase of the collection process. We also screen individual claims against various databases to determine whether any of the individual claims do not meet the specified criteria and should be returned, if contractually permitted. If we already service the purchased portfolio, the risks associated with the conversion process are minimized, since many of these steps have already been undertaken as part of its debt collection services. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.23,Third-Party Collection Services and Other CMS,5.23.1,Third-Party Collection Services,"_Our UK Division’s Third-Party Collection Services_ Although our UK Division primarily focuses on debt purchase, it performs limited third-party collection services in several sectors and offers certain other CMS activities. As a result of changing legislation that allows corporate entities to own a solicitors firm under the Alternative Business Structure (“ABS”) rules, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (“SRA”) granted us approval in June 2015, which took effect on October 1, 2015, to establish our own legal firm, Lowell Solicitors. Lowell Solicitors provides the majority of Litigation services to the group in the UK. We are one of the few businesses in the UK CMS industry to have applied for and received approval from the SRA to proceed with legal activities. The rollout of litigation capabilities is a major step towards the expansion of our fully integrated, end-to-end CMS approach. We believe that having a litigation capability will enable us to provide a more seamless experience for our consumers, a more efficient process that will generate commercial efficiencies for our investors, while improving the visibility of our control and oversight over the endto-end collection process for our clients. In July 2019, we acquired Lucas Credit Servicing, a UK DCA specializing in collections aligned to our litigation activity. Lucas Credit Servicing predominately provides third-party collection services to our UK Division, specifically debts proceeding through the litigation process and managed by Lowell Solicitors. Through Lucas we also offer third-party collection services to our UK clients. _Our DACH Division’s Third-Party Collection Services_ In the DACH region, we provide collection services to collect overdue debt and receivables both for our clients and for our owned debt portfolios. As of June 30, 2020, we serviced 27.6 million accounts, representing approximately 20.1 million consumer accounts within the third-party collection services business, with an aggregate face value on open accounts of €9.9 billion (£9.0 billion equivalent) including fees, interest and costs added to the principal amount. Our third-party collection services clients are debt originators in a range of sectors, including primarily the financial services sector, telecommunications, utilities, services, retail, fitness, and public sectors. The collection process that our DACH Division uses in its third-party collection services business is substantially similar to the collection process that it uses in its debt purchase business. For further details regarding these collection processes, see “—Debt Purchase—Collection Process—Our DACH Division’s Collection _Process.”_ We generate servicing fees through multiple channels, all of which are supported by the German and Austrian legal framework for debt collection, which provides for statutory and regulation-based fees for thirdparty collection companies. The service fees we earn depend on the contractual agreements we have with our clients. The fees that are passed on to the consumer are capped at statutory amounts under applicable regulation, including the German Introductory Act to the Legal Services Act (Einführungsgesetz _zum _Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz) and the German Legal Services Act (Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetz). Fees of third-_ party collection companies are limited to the amount a lawyer could claim for similar activities and are tied to the amount in dispute. Further fees are incurred by the consumer if a lawyer is eventually engaged in the collection process. These fees are passed on to the consumer as an additional damage amount. For further information on the regulatory environment in which we operate, see “Regulation.” Our third-party collection services do not require significant ramp-up costs and are therefore less capitalintensive than debt portfolio purchases. While an owned debt portfolio is recognized on the balance sheet, thirdparty collection services can be performed with limited balance-sheet impact, which mostly relates to certain upfront guaranteed payments on future collections that we grant some of our larger third-party collection services clients. In such cases, we guarantee that we will successfully collect a certain percentage of the outstanding principal amount of claims. These guaranteed payments are capitalized on our balance sheet. In addition to managing third-party receivables through contractual relationships with our clients, we have a successful track record of structuring a number of outsourcing deals in which we carved-out and took over clients’ in-house collection operations. These carve-out agreements may include transferring staff and growing the collection teams we take over. In exchange for these deals, we receive multi-year exclusive collection agreements and access to early-stage recovery debt. Since we conducted our first transaction of this kind in 2004, ----- we have successfully carved out CMS teams from clients within the telecommunications, insurance and financial services industries in four additional transactions. We have secured long-term collection agreements with terms of up to six years with the respective debt originators from which we have taken over the collection platform. Such transactions are typically done without upfront payment to the debt originator, although we may sometimes structure share deals equaling to the value of long-term service contracts. We believe our carve-out platform is mutually beneficial. We enable our clients to collect more receivables at lower cost due to our operating scale, experience, processes and tools. Long-term servicing contracts give us earning visibility and support our future revenue and cash flow generation. Exclusive access to early-stage debt also gives us opportunities to cross-sell other services, such as debt purchase, down the debt recovery cycle as we gain specialized familiarity with the clients’ debt portfolio. _Our Northern European Division’s Third-Party Collection Services_ Our Northern European Division collects overdue loans and other overdue receivables for our clients and specializes in engineering and implementing tailored collection strategies and sustainable, affordable solutions for the resolution of claims. The Northern European Division has third-party debt under management of €4.6 billion (£4.2 billion equivalent) as of June 30, 2020. The experienced staff works directly to collect debt, enabling our clients to (a) lower collection costs, due to the Northern European Division’s scale and automation of the debt collection process; and (b) increase recovery rates, due to a combination of the Northern European Division’s comprehensive databases and thorough understanding of our markets, which together enable us to optimally tailor debt collection strategies. The Northern European Division’s debt collection process is substantially standardized and automated, with the goal of maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach, rather than exploiting short-term collection potential. The Northern European Division undertakes the same debt collection process for our portfolios as we do for the overdue receivables of our clients, subject to any guidelines set by clients regarding settlement and specific procedures to utilize. Actions taken during the debt collection process take into account applicable country-specific laws and regulations and aim to preserve clients’ reputations. The Northern European Division has integrated several automated processes into our debt collection process to improve efficiency and reduce the need for manual case handling. These processes include: - _Standardized work processes depending on customer profile. Customer profiles and standardized processes determine when the Northern European Division’s agents should telephone, send a letter to, text message or use another means to contact the customer. - _Campaigns. We have implemented common processes for a group of claims and campaigns will typically begin when the Northern European Division expects customers to have an enhanced ability to pay. - _Event engines. Our software drives processes that prescribe a series of actions to be taken in connection with different external events, such as customer bankruptcy, death or address modification. - _Robotics. We have automated business processes through the use of advanced software, which includes a virtual workforce that can carry out processes significantly faster than humans, including selecting which customers to contact based on certain criteria and gathering information and business intelligence across channels. The Northern European Division has successfully implemented robotics in one of our markets and is currently rolling it out in the remaining markets. Moreover, it is about to pilot intelligent automation and artificial intelligence solutions together with an industry leading robotics vendor. The Northern European Division’s client-centric focus is evident in our approach to fee arrangements. During certain phases of debt collection, the Northern European Division works on a “no cure no pay” basis at fixed rates, which means that we only get paid if we are successful in collecting the relevant debt. In other phases, we typically work on a commission basis, taking a percentage of the cash collected from the end-customer. Additionally, we may also offer a profit or loss sharing model, where we charge commissions on collections received up to a certain threshold and, in addition, the client shares with the Northern European Division a percentage of collections received over that agreed threshold. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

They provide bespoke data and technology solutions that add value to the client throughout the clients’ credit life-cycle. These services, which we offer free of charge to certain of our debt originator clients, are complementary to our collection services offerings and facilitate our strategy of further embedding ourselves in our clients’ CMS chain. _Our DACH Division’s Other CMS_ In addition to our core third-party collection services and debt purchase businesses, we also provide a suite of further value-added services to our DACH Division’s clients. Our other services primarily cover three areas: risk management solutions, e-commerce solutions and data information services. Examples of these services include OrderCheck (which performs consumer default risk assessment before order execution for online payments) and the ClientMatching service (which matches known consumers with e-commerce sector clients). The commissions we generate for running credit checks are recorded as revenue in our third-party collection services business. However, the defaulted debt acquired is recorded in the debt purchase business, which, in accordance with statutory reporting rules, is immediately recognized with an impairment from the face value of the debt. In addition, we offer logistical and administrative services to the external lawyers we engage. _Our Northern European Division’s Other CMS_ The Northern European Division also offers a wide range of information, payment and invoicing services before debt is considered non-performing. - _Information services. Information services include credit information and analysis, data extraction and modelling and scorecard input and development. These services enable clients to mitigate credit risk and reduce potential losses from sales to new clients by providing efficient and reliable information on the creditworthiness of their customers. - _Invoicing services. Invoicing services include invoicing and reminder services.

Regular performance reviews are carried out with all clients, with the frequency determined by the client as well as the strategic importance of the relationship to us. Unique performance reviews include analysis of portfolio performance, consumer treatment, post-sale administration, future pipeline initiatives/developments, business updates and suggestions for further interaction/enhancements to the relationship. Our UK Division has been externally recognized and named as Debt Purchaser of the Year 2019 and awarded Best Use of Technology 2019 by Credit Strategy. We place a particular emphasis on securing long-term forward flow agreements with clients, with some contracts running for five years and an average contract length of approximately three years as of June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, approximately 43% of our UK Division’s cumulative portfolio purchases since inception were made pursuant to through forward flows, which management believes to be higher than any other debt purchaser in the UK. In the four years ended December 31, 2019, 50% of our UK Division’s re-tendered forward flow agreements have been renewed at least once. We employ a dedicated sector management strategy with clients, backed up by senior executive relationships within the company. In addition, we have client relationships across many functions, including operations, compliance and external recoveries, with central coordination via our sales and business development team. Since June 2014, we have offered our clients a suite of value-added services that are specifically targeted at strengthening our partnerships through providing bespoke data and technology solutions that add value to the client throughout the consumer credit life-cycle. See “—Third-Party Collection Services and Other CMS—Other _CMS.”_ Our DACH Division employs a comprehensive and coordinated approach to marketing and client relations. We have developed marketing and sales strategies that are tailored to each client sector including the energy, utilities, e-commerce, banking, payments and other sectors. We are also connected to the start-up sector, a connection which provides us with the opportunity to leverage strongly growing businesses and utilize multiplier partnerships. In addition to our in-house sales team of dedicated sector specialized sales managers, we have external sales representatives who support our sales efforts in specific industries. We have a carefully selected internal sales team consisting of dedicated sales managers who specialize in specific industries and are dedicated to finding solutions to customers’ problems and concerns. This sales team builds networks across sectors, bringing together contacts from different areas. Our operational centers have a strong sector expertise needed to support the industry specific approach. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we held an average relationship length of 8.8 years with our DACH Division’s top ten vendors by debt purchase income. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 13% of our DACH Division’s portfolio purchases were derived from clients with which we had held a relationship for five years or more. The Northern European Division organizes its sales and marketing efforts on a country level and on a pan-Northern European basis in combination. The sales force is organized into new sales and key account management. The sales staff reports to local country sales managers who, in turn, report dually to the Country Management and to the Nordic Head of Clients and Sales. In addition, there are individuals dedicated to client ----- delivery management, who are tasked with ensuring that its production delivers best-in-class service levels. The sales staff consists of highly skilled professionals with strong client and industry expertise, and with a particular focus on financial services. The Northern European Division’s client relationships are both broad and deep. We build relationships with clients on all relevant levels within the country organizations, ranging from purchasing/procurement and operations level and credit management, to finance and treasury functions and senior executive level. The Northern European Division’s dedicated client focus and track record of delivering top tier services have led to long-standing client relationships. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 55% of our 3PC income was generated from clients with which we had held a relationship for five years or more.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.34,Compliance and Risk Management,5.34.1,Our UK Division’s Compliance and Risk Management,"Our UK Division maintains a dedicated compliance team of approximately 103 FTEs as of June 30, 2020, up from 43 FTEs in 2013, which actively promotes compliance best practices across the business and seeks to achieve low rates of complaints. For example, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our UK Division achieved a rate of 0.3% for internal complaints. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our FOS-filed complaint ratio was low, with 11.9 cases per 1,000,000 financial services accounts. We work with consumers to obtain debt repayment in a proactive and supportive way based on data intelligence, analytics and, in the vast majority of cases, without the need to use litigation. Since our UK Division’s inception in May 2004, we have never faced any enforcement actions by any of the entities that regulate our operations, including the OFT and the FCA. We are a member of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, Civil Courts Users Association and Finance and Leasing Association. As a full member of the Credit Services Association, we comply with certain codes of practice. In addition, in April 2013, we launched our FAIR program, which outlines our policies on treating consumers fairly, consumer focused behavior, fair outcomes, assessing affordability and responding to client audits. Furthermore, our investment in operations has improved compliance oversight throughout our collections process. For example, we record all calls with our speech analytics and call-monitoring systems. We have also invested in teams to monitor performance and fill roles poorly suited to automation, such as manual pre-litigation ----- checking. We believe that our account databases also represent a source of compliance advantage, providing better data to inform decisions as to whether to seek collection, the most appropriate collection approach and the consumer’s likely ability to repay. Accounts are selected for litigation as a last resort when they have reached the end of an alternative strategy and a consumer has not engaged with us or made a reasonable offer of repayment. Selection involves a combination of quality, policy and scoring processes to ensure that only consumers that we believe are in a position to pay are selected. Automation of selection ensures consistent application of rules to exclude, for example, vulnerable consumers or those with a negative disposable income where this has been captured during any contact. Credit bureau data is used to verify the consumer’s whereabouts and the status of their credit profile which is taken into account when scoring for suitability. Prior to the commencement of any action, a manual sample check of selected accounts is made to ensure the integrity of the process before accounts are approved for release into the process by the Director of Business Optimisation and the Director of Litigation. We believe that our significant investment in operations has helped create an industry standard in compliance practices, with regular recognition for our strong focus on fair practices with respect to our clients, consumers and regulators. In 2016, our UK Division was awarded an “Exceptional” rating by Investors in Customers (“IIC”), a UK customer-experience consultancy. This was the second time we were awarded the rating. Our initial award, the first in our industry, was awarded in 2014. This has been followed by a “Gold Award” in 2017 (IIC have replaced their previous “star” ratings with bronze, silver and gold awards and Lowell was the first company to receive the Gold Award). Our UK Division also received a “Gold for Investors in Customers” award in 2018, “Debt Purchase Provider of the Year” in 2019, and “Best Use of Technology” for our roll out of Robotic Process Automation 2019, in each case from IIC, and benefits from a Trustpilot (a consumer review website) rating of 4.4/5 stars.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

A strong compliance culture is an increasingly important differentiating factor in the highly competitive and fragmented German debt collection market, as smaller players typically have weaker compliance systems and debt originators are increasingly more focused on reputation, compliance track record and audit trail. All of our processes incorporate what we believe to be leading compliance standards, which enable us to preserve our reputation and the reputation of our clients. We believe that our compliance culture reflects our beliefs in: taking a fair and reasonable stance when interacting with consumers; ensuring a fair outcome for the consumer; taking into account sustainability and affordability of payments; and treating consumers with respect and dignity. Our central Risk and Compliance function led by the DACH Chief Risk & Compliance officer contributes strongly to the management of our key compliance focus areas such as data protection, anti-money laundering as well as fraud prevention which are for many years already supported by mature data protection and anti-money laundering structures. The current DACH Division risk register is continuously updated by the responsible central risk managers. This enables the group to take the appropriate preventive actions regarding internal and external risks. This also enables the group to encourage good business decisions based on risk transparency. In the exercise of their duties, our managing directors as well as the Risk & Compliance Division are supported by the DACH Risk & Control Committee as well as the Group Risk Committee. We believe that our compliance structure contributes to our low consumer complaints track record. In 2014, Standard & Poor’s rated our DACH Division with the best possible “Strong” servicer rating as a special servicer of consumer finance, based on two of our major subsidiaries (PCS and SIR). The outstanding servicer rating result by has been confirmed once again in August 2018. In addition, our DACH Division received, on average, only 0.01% new consumer complaints per year as a percentage of active accounts for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020.

We have an embedded risk a management culture within these business units, effective risk management and compliance processes, such as training programs for employees and self-imposed regulatory controls, and an independent audit function with reporting lines to the management. The Northern European Division has a strong culture of consumer compliance seeking to offer debtors the best possible customer journey and supporting them in rebuilding a healthy personal financial profile. ----- The Northern European Division has also invested significantly into individual compliance training and instilling a strong customer centric corporate culture, leading to positive customer feedback. The Northern European Division’s clients deem its ethical behavior and strict compliance with laws and regulations as essential in order for them to utilize our services. The laws and regulations that we operate under have at their core the fair treatment of all customers, which we have sought to integrate into day-to-day operations and culture. Our debt collection process is designed to yield financial results while protecting clients’ reputations. The Northern European Division’s collection process is centered around: - polite persistence, where collectors take a fair and reasonable stance when interacting with customers; - ensuring a fair outcome for the customer, taking into account sustainability and affordability of payments; and - treating customers with respect and dignity. The Northern European Division has robust internal compliance standards, which are applicable to all employees and all employees are expected to become acquainted with and comply with these standards. The standards regarding regulatory compliance define, among other things, governing principles regarding identification of governing laws and regulations, delegation of compliance responsibilities, guidelines on education and competence, testing and documentation of regulatory compliance control measures. On a yearly basis, a compliance self-assessment and review process is conducted with the purpose of providing management with an objective assessment of the status of compliance with regards to legislation and regulation, as well as internal governance principles, policies and procedures. The findings of the assessment supported by the Nordic Risk & Control Committee as well as the Group Risk Committee enable senior management to initiate any necessary remedial activities. The Northern European Division has invested heavily in compliance systems and controls, as well as the training of employees, to increase awareness of regulatory requirements and policies. We provide comprehensive training to employees on legal and regulatory compliance. Through training sessions, it is our goal to provide an insight into, and gain an understanding of, an employee’s obligations in ensuring legal and regulatory compliance.

We believe that our focus on compliance resonates with debt originators and is essential for providers of CMS to succeed in an increasingly regulated market. Our focus on compliance means that “treating customers fairly” is embedded within our day-to-day processes. We have a clear governance structure and experienced senior management across all parts of our organization, so that all key components of the business receive appropriate attention. Our centralized operational risk management and compliance functions ensure central implementation of requirements and guidelines, as well as standardized risk policy and measures. Our compliance operations have been designed with a focus on three main objectives: to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to enforce a fair treatment of consumers and to preserve our reputation and the reputations of our clients. Our key areas of risk management include data protection, anti-money laundering and fraud prevention. Each of our divisions’ managing directors are responsible for the overall effectiveness of risk management and compliance throughout our operating entities and are under the supervision of our regional supervisory boards. In addition to regional governance structures, we have a Group Audit Committee that supports the internal audit functions in the UK Division, DACH Division and Northern European Division by conducting group audits based on an annual group audit plan. In addition, as part of the annual accounting close, external auditors conduct a review of the adequacy of the risk management and compliance functions. Our approach to compliance includes a “three lines of defense” model to promote a strong compliance culture: (1) “Operational Controls,” (2) “Accountable for Oversight” and (3) “Accountable for Assurance.” The first line of defense, Operational Controls, focuses on operational adherence to compliance requirements and is achieved through reporting by the operations team and monitoring by team leaders and by the quality assurance team, including call-quality monitoring. The second line of defense, Accountable for Oversight, focuses on quality assurance through managerial oversight of operational activity and review of the control testing of the first line of defense. The third line of defense, Accountable for Assurance, comprises internal audit and consists of reviewing and assessing the adequacy of controls in place.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Our UK, DACH and Northern European Divisions share best practices and technology infrastructure between them. Our business strategy is based on sustaining a continuously improving technology infrastructure, with our IT organization focused on the goals of centralization, standardization, scalability, security and high availability. We leverage a blend of sophisticated proprietary systems and partnerships with technology industry leaders in order to achieve these goals. Our IT department is focused on: _Provision of IT services. Our IT organization has a centralized model that covers technical services,_ change management, application management and service management in each of our UK, DACH and Northern European Divisions. The centralized model enforces common IT strategy, policies, methodologies, standards and consistency across processes and tools, thus helping to ensure economies of scale, cost savings and cost avoidance across IT services. It also allows us to implement an effective segregation of duties, which increases confidence in accountability and quality controls. In support of our internal governance and management framework, we have obtained various accreditations with respect to industry standards, such as PCI DSS compliance (credit card standards), ISO27001 (IT security) and ISO9001 (quality management). _Industrialized infrastructure. We aim to provide industry-leading IT infrastructure services, which_ include a scalable, resilient and highly available data center (with a private cloud) and wide area data network, ----- with full disaster recovery services and an around-the-clock service-management model. Our global partner Fujitsu provides a 24-hour security operations center and network operations center. Our strategic IT infrastructure service providers include Fujitsu, Vodafone, IBM, Interoute, Advania, Rackspace, Maintel and SunGard Recovery Services. Fujitsu provides private, public and hybrid Cloud and Infrastructure Managed Services which provide the private cloud for our data center and disaster recovery services for the UK and Northern European Divisions, they are the third-largest global infrastructure services provider and provide both service management and service desk management. Vodafone provides the hosted cloud services for the DACH Division, working on similar contract and service schedules as Fujitsu, which provides further convergence opportunities for the future. Maintel, in partnership with industry-leading telecommunications companies, is our data network service provider for the UK Division. Vodafone provides these services for the DACH Division and Interoute provides these services for the Northern European Division. SunGard provides enterprise-level business continuity management services ensuring ‘on-tap’ connectivity to our core environment in the event of site failure. Our IT infrastructure services are fully implemented, with our UK Division’s operational since 2014, our DACH Division’s operational since 2018 and our Northern European Division’s operational since 2019. Our infrastructure model provides strategic flexibility: the services are “location independent,” providing flexibility to the business in support of future acquisition and location strategies. Our IT infrastructure partnership hosts all of our UK, Northern European and DACH applications and data, resulting in cost savings, cost avoidance and increased security and resilience. We are committed to maintaining high standards of data protection, client information and information security. All cloud infrastructure and systems are protected by multiple layers of security technologies providing a defense in depth approach and are constantly updated to avoid cyber-attacks. We have a dedicated Chief Information & Security Officer with a team of security experts that have developed our Cyber Security Strategy and increased our protection with enhanced processes, tools and monitoring and awareness and education of security risks. _Application rationalization. We have undertaken a major application rationalization program since 2015,_ including the refresh of the IT Technical Architecture, a new messaging system and standard business-toconsumer (“B2C”) and business-to-business (“B2B”) portal architecture. The UK Division has rationalized on a single collections system for the support of debt purchase and servicing models. Through the acquisition of Lucas Collections the UK Division has a new litigation system with modern portal architecture to support this business model. In Northern Europe, the collections application is being rationalized to one platform to serve both debt purchase and debt servicing models. In the DACH Division, using modern architecture the technology landscape will provide more digital channels and business processing capabilities than the current collection platforms. The Group IT Convergence Strategy (2020 – 2023) continues to enhance the roadmap across applications, digital space, infrastructure, telephony, data, suppliers and security to identify consolidation and simplification opportunities. Through such enhancement and convergence, application and infrastructure simplification is expected to improve productivity in our delivery of technology solutions and lower the costs associated with the development of these solutions by allowing us to more fully adopt a “build once, use many times” approach when adding functionality to our IT systems. For example, a single new account services function is now used by three different business applications. We believe application simplification will also reduce data replication through facilitating an increasingly centralized approach to data management services, and we believe this, in turn, will both reduce expenses associated with our data management services and help to ensure data-retention policies are effective. We have a program delivering data lake solutions that can be adopted across all the Divisions. The adoption of AI and deep machine learning will be part of the new data lake management services, enhancing our decision science capabilities as well as operational analytics and business intelligence capabilities. A number of business solutions that make use of external technology have been enabled by this strategy, including our use of BLAZE, a contact strategy decision engine from leading U.S.-based software provider FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation). We believe that the use of BLAZE has promoted our use of contact strategies that are tailored to a consumer’s individual needs and circumstances and thereby helped to reduce expenses, for example by providing information that will allow us to avoid unnecessary letters and improved collections. We are considering using BLAZE as the standard decision engine across all the Divisions. Other solutions include new platforms for our external recoveries (AMOS), digital processes and query management system, all of which we believe will provide net benefits. We believe we will be able to continue to extend Caseflow (UK), our proprietary collections and consumer management application, to support other critical business functions. ----- The ultimate goal of these initiatives is to provide a centralized consumer management system that will shift away from an account-focused processing toward a single consumer view and consumer-based processing. By implementing a single consumer view, we believe we will be able to make our UK Division’s core operational processes more efficient for both us and our consumers by enabling initiatives such as single consumer lettering, which was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, which consolidates a consumer’s multiple account details onto a single letter, thereby reducing cost and improving the consumer experience. In addition, we also believe we will be able to decommission other existing systems, which we anticipate will lead to cost savings. Through constant analysis and review we continue to identify waste and replication and remove it efficiently as part of our best practice data management approach. A measurement of this approach has been the removal of a significant number of replica and ineffective data stores. _Extended consumer self-service via an enhanced digital channel. An improved B2C channel, which was_ implemented in November 2015, and refreshed in 2019, has provided an enhanced consumer experience involving more self-service capability and an improved look and feel. This solution completely replaced the previous B2C channel, and features improved security features, consumer discounts, straight-through processing of payments and changes to consumer details, uninterrupted availability, a consumer budget planner and many other features. The channel is accessible from various mobile devices and supports different internet browsers. Further releases are expected to provide mobile-specific applications and the ability to deliver online letters and statements, as well as support marketing and letter strategies. We are also looking at a multi-channel strategy, which will bring all of our consumer communication channels under a single cohesive structure that provides consistency and accuracy across all consumer interactions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.41,REGULATION Key Regulations Affecting Our UK Division,5.41.1,The Financial Conduct Authority,"The FCA is the current regulator of consumer credit in the UK. The FCA took over regulation of the consumer credit industry, including the debt sector, from the OFT on April 1, 2014. Consumer credit agencies and those conducting business in the debt sector are now subject to a statutory regime under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”). Pursuant to the FSMA, in order to carry on consumer credit activities, a firm needs to be authorized by FCA (instead of being licensed by the OFT as was formerly the case) or otherwise be exempt. FSMA and its related secondary legislation is supported by the detailed FCA Handbook of Rules and Guidance (the “FCA Rules”) and the associated FCA supervision and enforcement powers. As a result, the regulation of consumer credit activity is aligned in large part with the current regulatory regime for banks, insurance and investment firms. At the same time, however, many of the specific statutory requirements governing consumer credit activity under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (“CCA”) and its secondary legislation continue to co-exist alongside the FSMA regime, with the FCA assuming the OFT’s former responsibility regarding enforcement of this legislation. As a result of the transfer of the old Financial Services Authority’s functions now being split between the FCA for conduct matters and the Prudential Regulation Authority, for prudential matters (with the latter’s responsibilities confined mainly to banking and insurance), the FCA has been granted enhanced enforcement powers and is taking a more proactive and interventionist approach to regulation and enforcement than its predecessor. The FCA’s enforcement powers and approach is significantly enhanced from that of the old OFT. The FCA has broad investigative and disciplinary powers, including the power to impose fines and vary or cancel regulatory permissions. Failure to comply with the FCA rules could lead to liability for damages to third parties, disciplinary action, public censures, fines, the imposition of other penalties, customers being compensated for losses, or the revocation or variation of authorizations to conduct business, in whole or in part both on regulated firms and their employees. For firms which it regulates, the FCA’s strategic objective is to ensure that the markets which it regulates function well. The FCA also has three key operational objectives: - to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; - to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and - to promote effective competition in the interests of customers for regulated financial services or services carried out by regulated investment exchanges. Under the FCA regime, historical requirements applicable to us will continue to apply under the CCA, along with requirements deriving from the FSMA and the FCA Rules. In the latter case, many of the FCA requirements are similar to those that apply already to banks and other regulated financial services firms. In addition, the FCA has created a sector-specific Consumer Credit sourcebook (“CONC”), which applies specifically to consumer credit firms such as ourselves. Among other things, CONC incorporates some of the previous CCA provisions and historic OFT guidance, in many cases as rules. The FCA’s stated general approach to retaining OFT guidance has been to carry it across to CONC in substantially the same form and with substantially the same effect as previously. To date, the FCA has focused both on specific sectors in the consumer credit industry (including, for example, the high-cost short-term credit, rent-to-own, logbook loan, home-collected credit and catalogue credit sectors) as well ----- as focusing attention on broader thematic issues (including, for example, credit broking, credit cards, debt management, affordability and creditworthiness, staff remuneration and incentives and vulnerability).",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Within our UK Division, there are three operating companies which have permission under Part 4A of FSMA. to carry on regulated activities as follows: (a) Lowell Portfolio I Ltd (firm reference number 730071) is solely a purchaser of consumer debt and undertakes no debt collection activities—it has FCA authorization for: - exercising or having the right to exercise the lender’s rights and duties in relation to highcost short-term credit; - exercising or having the right to exercise the lender’s rights and duties under a regulated home credit loan agreement; and - exercising/having the right to exercise the lender’s rights and duties under a regulated credit agreement (excluding high-cost short-term credit, bill of sale agreements, and home collected credit agreement); (b) Lowell Financial Ltd (firm reference number 730175) undertakes debt collection work solely for Lowell Portfolio I Ltd in respect of its purchased debts—it has FCA authorization to carry on debt administration and debt-collecting; and (c) Fredrickson International Limited (firm reference number 730425) undertakes debt collection work as the authorized agent for various third parties—it has FCA authorization to carry on debt administration and debt-collecting. As part of its supervisory role in the consumer credit industry, the FCA classifies consumer credit firms into lower and higher risk categories, depending on the types of activities provided. Further firm-specific subclassification by the FCA will determine the level of supervisory scrutiny to which individual consumer credit firms are subject. At the time of FCA authorization in 2017, our UK regulated entities were confirmed as being “flexible portfolio” firms meaning that they are not allocated a named individual supervisor. In high level terms, the key areas of FCA regulation that apply to us under the FCA regime include: - high level “Threshold Conditions” for authorization (including adequate resources and “suitability” of firms and their affiliates from a fitness and propriety perspective); - high level “Principles for Businesses.” Of particular relevance is the obligation on a firm to “pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.” This Principle is supported by detailed FCA guidance on “Treating Customers Fairly” (“TCF”), which sets out the FCA’s expectations in relation to a regulated business’ treatment of its customers; - systems and controls, including governance, record keeping, conflicts of interest management and internal audit (some of which will apply as guidance rather than mandatory rules); - the approval of senior managers (that is, directors and other senior management/key staff performing certain senior management functions requiring individual FCA approval and being subject to the FCA Senior Manager and Individual Conduct Rules as set out in the COCON chapter of the FCA Rules and enforcement powers); - controllers (major shareholders and others) to be FCA approved; - auditors; - consumer credit conduct of business and marketing, including debt collection; ----- - regulatory reporting; - complaints handling; - financial crime/AML; and - FCA enforcement powers. The FCA has the power to take enforcement action against a firm and/or its Senior Managers for breach of one or more of the Principles for Business or, in the case of Senior Managers, the Conduct Rules, which may result in the imposition of substantial fines, public censure, compensation and/or redress payable to customers. Breach of certain requirements under the FSMA also carries potential criminal liability. Customers can also bring private claims for damages under FSMA for loss suffered as a result of a contravention by a FCA authorized person of a rule made by the FCA. Further, where a regulated credit agreement is entered into without the lender having FCA permission, the agreement is likely to be unenforceable without an order from the FCA. Additionally, if an unauthorized credit broker referred the borrower to an authorized lender, any resulting regulated credit agreement between the lender and the borrower may be unenforceable. It is therefore prudent for lenders who originate business through brokers to ensure that they are appropriately authorized.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.41,REGULATION Key Regulations Affecting Our UK Division,5.41.3,Further ongoing statutory obligations,"The OFT issued specific guidance called the Debt Collection Guidance (“DCG”) and the Irresponsible Lending Guidance (“ILG”), which set out detailed standards that businesses that collect debt or carry out tracing activities must meet. The DCG has been superseded by CONC which applies specifically to consumer credit firms such as ourselves. CONC in effect is the relevant provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, the DCG, the ILG and other OFT Guidance redrafted into formal FCA rules and guidance. CONC sets out a number of overarching principles that businesses should adopt in any debt recovery activities: 1. treating customers fairly; 2. being transparent when dealing with customers; 3. exercising forbearance and due consideration—in particular towards customers experiencing financial difficulty; 4. acting proportionately when seeking to recover debts; 5. establishing and implementing clear, effective and appropriate policies and procedures for engaging with customers and other relevant parties, including credit worthiness assessments and dealing with customers whose accounts fall into arrears; and 6. establishing and implementing clear, appropriate and effective policies and procedures for identifying and dealing with customers who the firm understands or reasonably suspects to be particularly vulnerable. CONC also provides examples of the types of behavior that the FCA would regard as amounting to unfair or improper practices and unacceptable behavior. Examples include: - issuing communications to customers that are unfair, inaccurate, unclear or misleading (whether directly or through the way they appear or information which they may omit to mention); - falsely representing their authority or legal position (for example, falsely claiming to work on instructions from the courts as bailiffs); - using physical or psychological harassment to collect debts (including contacting customers at inappropriate times of the day or too often, failing to allow for alternative, affordable repayment amounts when a reasonable proposal is made, or inappropriately threatening to disclose debt details to third parties); ----- - using deceptive or unfair methods (for example, sending demands to a person without establishing that he or she is the actual customer); - inappropriately or unfairly charging for debt recovery (for example, misleading customers into believing they are liable for recovery charges, where the underlying credit agreement does not so provide); - acting in a threatening or unclear way on debt collection visits (for example, visiting the customer at times when it is understood that such debtor might be particularly vulnerable or entering a customer’s property without consent or appropriate court order); - continuing to collect statute barred debt in an unfair way (for example, implying that such debt may be recoverable through the courts); and - failing to have adequate procedures and processes to ensure that customer data is accurate such that the correct customer is pursued for the correct amount of debt. With specific regard to vulnerable customers, on July 31, 2020, the FCA issued updated draft guidance as part on an ongoing consultation process, concluding on September 30, 2020, reinforcing the requirement to treat vulnerable customers fairly, understand vulnerable customer needs and the impact of vulnerability on the customer needs as well as to ensure staff and processes are adequate to deal with vulnerable customer needs. The current guidance remains broad but is intended to form the basis of final guidance that will be issued either in 2020 or early 2021. The FCA also expects regulated firms to take responsibility for third parties they use (for example, third party debt collectors). Generally the use of DCAs probably represents one of the more significant conduct risks faced by us, particularly in the way this part of our business model tests our controls in relation to DCAs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.41,REGULATION Key Regulations Affecting Our UK Division,5.41.4,Consumer credit legislative and regulatory requirements,"As noted above, many of the provisions of the pre-existing statutory regime under the CCA and related secondary legislation, continue to apply to our business and our relationships with customers, notwithstanding the transition from the OFT to the FCA and the various requirements introduced as a result. Although this summary does not purport to provide a full description of all such current or future requirements, a key ongoing area of responsibility for any properly regulated debt collection business arises under the CCA (and legislation made under it), FCA rules and guidance, the UTCCRs (for any contract made before October 1, 2015) and the CRA (for any contract made on or after October 1, 2015). This is also an area of the law in which further regulatory changes are anticipated in the medium term. Both the CCA and the UTCCRs/CRA set out specific requirements for the entry into and ongoing management of consumer credit arrangements. The legislation includes both prescriptive and generic provisions on the terms of consumer credit agreements, the advertising of consumer credit services, and what constitutes, and the consequences of, any unfair relationships and unfair terms. This legislation applies both to our own activities and to those of any initial credit provider, including our vendors. The principal aim of the legislation is consumer protection. These legal requirements oblige creditors to, among other things: - provide customers with prescribed forms of pre-contractual documentation; - provide customers with prescribed credit agreement documentation at the outset; - enable customers to obtain copies of credit agreement documentation; - provide customers with prescribed forms of post-contractual statements and notices at prescribed times; - provide a fair relationship between themselves and the customers (an “unfair relationship” can be the result of an act or omission at any time); and - ensure that their agreements do not contain unfair terms (and provides that any unfair terms are not binding on the customer). ----- In addition to the above, the creditor has a duty at the request of the debtor under regulated credit agreements to provide a copy of the executed agreement (if any) and of any other document referred to in it, and to provide specified information in a signed statement (sections 77, 78 and 79, CCA). If the creditor does not provide the documents and information within 12 working days of receiving a request with the fee of £1, then they are not entitled to enforce the agreement while the default continues. The creditor need not respond to a request for the information described above where no sums are payable by the debtor or where the request is made less than one month after a previous request (relating to the same agreement) was complied with. Under the CCA, a customer may request a court to determine whether there has been an “unfair relationship” between the customer and the lender (which can include assignees). There are extensive and onerous requirements that apply when such a determination is made, and the burden of proof is on a lender to prove that an unfair relationship does not exist. The content of, and format for, regulated agreements, as well as provisions around pre- and postcontractual information, is heavily prescribed by the CCA (including secondary legislation made under it) and FCA Rules, primarily within CONC. A regulated credit agreement must be properly executed in accordance with section 61 of the CCA. This includes ensuring that the agreement: - is in the prescribed form containing all the prescribed terms and conforming to regulations under section 60(1) of the CCA; - is signed in the prescribed manner both by the debtor and by, or on behalf of, the creditor; - embodies all the terms of the agreement (other than implied terms); - is provided to the debtor in a legible format; and - where the regulated credit agreement is to be secured on land, additional formality requirements apply. Section 65 of the CCA provides that improperly executed agreements (in real terms, agreements which do not fully comply with all of the regulatory requirements including the signature of the borrower) are not capable of being enforced against the borrower without an order of the court directing that such an agreement be enforceable. This will also apply to enforcement by assignees. Since April 6, 2007, the court has had discretion in all cases to enforce regulated agreements, whether or not they comply in all respects with the requirements of the CCA, provided that the appropriate arrears notice(s) and statements have been given (where appropriate). In the case of any agreement entered into on or after April 6, 2007, and agreements from before that date which are not irredeemably unenforceable, the court will be obliged to make an enforcement order even where an agreement is regarded as improperly executed, unless it considers it just to dismiss the application having regard to both prejudice caused to any person as a result of the breach and the degree of culpability for it. The court has other powers to address the defect by other means under the CCA, such as reducing or discharging a sum payable to compensate for the prejudice suffered. While the discretion given to the courts does not rule out regulated agreements being treated as unenforceable because of technical breaches, on balance it is likely that the more technical the alleged breach is, the more likely a court will be to consider it just to grant the enforcement order.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.41,REGULATION Key Regulations Affecting Our UK Division,5.41.5,Unfair Contract Terms,"The UTCCRs apply to agreements which have not been individually negotiated, which are entered into with a consumer on or after July 1, 1995 and before October 1, 2015, and may affect our ability to seek enforcement of certain terms of our customers’ original contracts, such as rights of the lender to vary the interest rate and certain terms imposing early repayment charges and terms which give the lender a unilateral right to vary the contract or interpret any term of the contract. In light of the broad and general wording of the UTCCRs which makes any assessment of the fairness of terms largely subjective, it is difficult to predict whether or not a court would find a term to be unfair. It is therefore possible that any credit agreement that has been made or may be ----- made to customers covered by the UTCCRs may contain terms that are, if challenged, found to be unfair, which may result in the terms not being binding on the customer. The CRA received Royal Assent on March 26, 2015 and its main provisions came into force on October 1, 2015. The adoption of the CRA consolidates reform of consumer law in the United Kingdom including the revocation of the UTCCRs for new consumer contracts made on or after October 1, 2015. The previous law under the UTCCRs will continue to apply to older contracts. The CRA has a wider scope than the UTCCRs because it applies to both negotiated and non-negotiated contracts. The key substantive provisions of the UTCCRs have, however, been retained in the CRA, which merges the provisions of the UTCCRs with the provisions of the (wider scope) Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 to consolidate and clarify the two regimes. The legislation includes provisions to regulate the unfairness of terms that cause a significant imbalance between the parties, alongside the concepts of a “blacklist” of unenforceable terms and non-exhaustive “grey” list of potentially unfair terms. The CRA introduces new “grey” items and also extends the scope of the regulatory regime on unfair terms in part to “consumer notices” provided by the service provider. Consumer notices include an announcement or other communication which it is reasonable to assume is intended to be read by a consumer. The CRA gives consumer law enforcers additional civil powers to seek to remedy breaches of consumer protection law. For example, new redress measures will offer compensation to consumers who have suffered a loss as a result of the conduct in question, and new compliance measures intend to prevent or reduce the risk of repeat conduct. In addition new choice measures in the CRA enable consumers to choose more effectively between different suppliers. In March 2015, the FCA removed certain guidance and other material on the UTCCR from its website because they no longer reflect the FCA’s current view on unfair contract terms. The FCA has confirmed that it does not intend to issue further guidance on unfair contract terms. In January 2016, the FCA website was updated to refer to the Competition and Markets Authority’s (“CMA”) guidance consultation as the latest development in guidance on unfair contract terms, and this guidance makes it clear that the CRA generally carries forward rather than changes the substance of the protections provided to consumers under earlier legislation and guidance. The FOS acts as an independent adjudicator of the consumer credit complaints made to it. Chargeable claims attract a fee that is paid by the business, and a decision by the FOS is binding on the business, but not on the consumer. Not all cases are determined to be “chargeable” however, the fee in respect of a chargeable case is payable by the business, whether or not the business successfully defends such case. There are escalation procedures for a consumer to make a complaint to the FOS. The FOS makes a decision on the basis of what is fair and reasonable and good practice rather than, necessarily, on the basis of compliance with the law.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.41,REGULATION Key Regulations Affecting Our UK Division,5.41.6,Data protection,"As a debt purchase business with operations in the UK, DACH and Northern European regions, we must comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Laws. _Data Protection Law Requirements_ The Data Protection Laws impose stringent requirements regarding our processing of personal data as well as our ability to hire service providers to assist with our processing of personal data. The basis of the GDPR, which applies in all EU Member States, is that data subjects have a fundamental right to the protection of their personal data. In order to protect this right, GDPR requires that organizations process personal data in a fair, transparent and lawful manner. GDPR requires that we inform customers about how we collect, use and maintain their personal data, the lawful basis we rely on to process it and who we share their personal data with according to the purpose for which the data subject has provided or understood that their personal data would be used. GDPR introduces certain direct obligations on data processors and requires that detailed contractual obligations be implemented between all data controllers and processors. Thus, as a controller, we must have detailed and specific instructions and agreements with our services providers (processors) about how they handle personal data. Processors also have direct liability for processing personal data that they know or believe to be contrary to the GDPR or for processing in contravention of the controller’s instructions. As a controller we are fully liable for data processing done by our processors and both the controller and processor have heightened record keeping and security requirements for documenting their processing and regulatory compliance. As a result, our liability and expenses, including legal fees, insurance and IT have increased and will continue to do so. In addition, GDPR requires us to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the organization’s processing requirements and risk. Organizations must notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours and in some instances, provide notification to data subjects. ----- GDPR provides data subjects with personal rights to have access to their personal data as well as to have their personal data updated, have their personal data transmitted to another organization and in some instances stop the organization from processing their personal data or require the deletion of their personal data. Another important data subject right, relevant to our industry, is that data subjects have the right not to have decisions, which have a legal or similarly significant effect for the data subject, made about them using automated decision making and profiling without human intervention. These obligations also increase our customer services requirements, oversight and expenses on an ongoing basis. _Liability_ Liability under the Data Protection Laws has increased under GDPR, and supervisory authorities in each EU member state and the UK have wide discretion in imposing fines, with the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover. After the Transition Period organizations will face the potential for double regulatory fines in both the UK and EU. GDPR also provides a private right of action for material or nonmaterial damage and the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered as a result of an infringement. Finally, the risk to our reputation from adverse publicity resulting from regulatory intervention, both from an industry as well as consumer standpoint, increases our overall risk profile. In addition, legal uncertainties about the legality of cookies and other tracking technologies may increase regulatory scrutiny, and increase potential civil liability under data protection or consumer protection laws. Several countries in the EU have recently issued guidance on the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies which require an additional layer of consent from website users for third party advertising, social media advertising and analytics. Consent to place cookies on a user’s device now requires explicit consent to each type of cookie and transparency notices outlining the processing of cookie data. Though there are broad similarities in the approach, there are also jurisdictional differences in relation to EU-UK cooperation with regard to views on advertising and marketing, making it more difficult to employ a common set policies and marketing strategies for companies that market products throughout Europe. Germany and the UK are both at the forefront of regulation in the area of cookies, advertising and consent and regulatory activism is on the rise in these and other EU member states with regard to new rules on disclosure and consent has led to increased investigation activity and fines. Finally, in addition to these regulatory risks, infringement of these laws can lead to reputational risk and significantly undermine customers’ trust in our business. We further note that the UK FCA is particularly focused on operational resilience and has taken action against regulated firms which have suffered incidents leading to the loss, disclosure or mishandling of customer data. _Marketing and Advertising Issues_ The ePrivacy Directive regulations govern privacy in electronic communications including direct marketing via email, SMS/text and phone as well as cookies. The current EU Member States’ local guidance in line with GDPR has significantly increased the risk of penalties for breach of the GDPR and law implementing the ePrivacy Directive. Increased regulation of privacy and data protection may lead to broader restrictions about the way we market our products on a global basis, increase our risk of regulatory oversight and affect our ability to reach our consumers and our capability to provide our consumers with personalized services and experiences. The European Union’s institutions are now debating the ePrivacy Regulation, which would repeal and replace the current ePrivacy Directive that regulates electronic marketing and use of cookies and tracking technologies. The new guidance and the ePrivacy Regulation would together require extensive disclosure and consent, regulate web beacons and similar technology affecting our ability to use a user’s location and other data for personalized advertising and alter the ability of retail advertisers to place ads across social media and the web. _Brexit_ Following the end of the Transition Period, we will continue to have to comply with both the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018. The relationship between the UK and the EU including the cooperation and application of decisions made by the European Commission and the European Court of Justice (CJEU) remains to be seen. In addition, the UK is now in an indefinite holding period with regard to its ability to be recognized by the EU as having “adequacy” for cross border transactions. The UK will be a “third country” vis a vis the EEA member states requiring cross border transfer mechanisms that UK businesses were not previously required to employ, which may cause additional legal expense and delays in sending personal data to and from the EU. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

We are proactively involved in the Credit Services Association (“CSA”). Our Non-Executive Director, UK Division served as the President of the CSA for two and a half years both before and after joining the Group, during which time she led the working party which re drafted the CSA Code of Practice. She is now the CSA Director with responsibility for the compliance portfolio. The laws and regulations under which we operate have at their core the fair treatment of all consumers, which we have sought to embed within our day to day processes. We seek to provide realistic repayment options for all consumers and in particular those in financial difficulty. By offering consumers flexible and sustainable payment plans tailor made to their individual needs, we help consumers pay down their debt and improve their credit histories on a consensual basis. As a general policy, we have historically not added any charges or fees to the debt we collect. We have dedicated policies and processes to deal with consumers, which are periodically reviewed and enhanced where necessary, and we liaise with external bodies such as the CSA to promote best practice.

In addition, the purpose of this internal policy is to ensure that the need to protect vulnerable customers and treat them fairly is strongly embedded in our culture. Depending on individual case assessment, the debt may be written off or reduced, payment terms may be reset, or a payment holiday may be granted.

We handle and process large amounts of consumer personal data, such as names, account numbers, contact information and other account specific data. Our ability to obtain, retain, share and otherwise process this personal data is governed by the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR is supplemented by local data protection laws in the EU member states, in Germany by the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018) and in Austria by the Data Protection Act (Datenschutzgesetz), both of which went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR is a uniform framework laying down principles for legitimate data processing in the European Union and the European Economic Area. Compared to the predecessor Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), the GDPR contains significantly stricter requirements for data protection, in particular for data mapping, transparency, data subject rights, processor (service provider) obligations, the requirement to designate a data protection officer and the obligations to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, including submitting data breach notifications (within a strict deadline) to the relevant supervisory authority and data subjects. We are also subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities (“DPA”) in Germany and Austria. The GDPR provides for significantly increased sanctions and penalties. DPAs can, _inter alia, impose monetary penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of global annual group turnover, whichever is the greater, on organizations for serious breaches of GDPR and, under certain circumstances, criminal fines and penalties. Under the GDPR, personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and may only be processed in a manner consistent with these purposes. Personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and/or processed, and it must not be kept in a form that permits identification of consumers for longer than is necessary for those purposes. The GDPR also strengthens individuals’ rights and imposes stricter requirements on companies processing personal data. For example, GDPR has led to an increase in requests from data subjects based on their enhanced rights such as the right to access their personal data, the right of deletion and the right to restrict the processing of their personal data. We have implemented an internal data protection organization, including the appointment of data protection officers for our companies in the DACH Division, and we have established data protection processes and policies. Overall, we have a robust data protection framework that is based on the GDPR and applicable local data protection laws. However, the task of meeting all the Data Protection Laws requirements is complex, in particular taking into account that there are still material legal uncertainties in various respects and that data protection authorities continuously publish more detailed GDPR guidance. Our GDPR program identified risks and associated mitigation plans and we adopted a risk based approach to their prioritization. A privacy operating model has been defined with clear roles and responsibilities and is in the process of being embedded in all regions, including the DACH Division. Further automation and system change is planned via other strategic programs, which will continue to mature our capability and privacy management framework to strengthen compliance with Data Protection Laws, including the GDPR. The ‘Data Protection by Design and by Default’ concept under the GDPR has required a reappraisal of our IT and Business Change and Procurement approaches to integrate data protection into our processes, practices and systems from the design stage right through the lifecycle. This includes carrying out data protection impact assessments, ensuring that data minimization is embedded across the business so that only the appropriate amount of data required for any particular purpose is processed, deleting unnecessary data and anonymizing data wherever possible. Specific provisions in the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018) regulate the legitimacy of credit reporting and scoring as well as transparency requirements for such types of data processing. ----- It may only be used if data protection rules are met, if relevant data are used and if the score is based on acknowledged, reliable mathematical-statistical methods. If address data are used the law requires a prior notice to the data subject. The use of a probability value calculated by credit reporting agencies to determine a natural person’s ability and willingness to pay is subject to further requirements stipulated in the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz 2018). Personal data relating to collected or purchased debt is partly governed by sector specific data protection regulations or secrecy obligations. Our business is dependent on the ability of third parties to provide us with personal data relating to collected or purchased debt, including personal data provided by the original creditors, credit information bureaus as well as publicly available personal data.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Instead, each country has developed its own set of rules for debt collection operations. The regulations cover, among other things: the methods by which claims can be assigned or transferred; the ways in which a customer can be contacted and a debt collected; and the types and level of fees, interests and costs that can be imposed, and whether those fees, interests and costs can be passed to the customer or the client. In countries where there are no specific regulations covering debt collection and where no licensing requirements apply for certain debt collection operations, there are still regulations of a more general nature which we must observe when carrying out our debt collection operations. Such regulations include, for example, general civil and commercial rules and consumer protection laws and regulations regarding caps on collection fees and interest costs. In addition, in a number of markets in which we operate, the reimbursement of costs for debt collection is limited by law. Any regulatory changes reducing the amount of such costs we can recover may have a negative impact on our results of operations. In many of the countries in which our operations are licensed or regulated, our subsidiaries are subject to certain integrity tests with respect to debt collection. These integrity tests may include verifying that: the collection business is carried out in accordance with local rules and regulations; consumer lending operations are conducted in accordance with sound lending practices; the directors of the board have sufficient knowledge and experience and have not misused any debt collection permissions; and the directors meet other general suitability and reliability checks. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

In a majority of the countries in which we operate, it is possible to extend the statutes of limitation on historic debt claims indefinitely by using various methods, including enforcement actions, notification of the customer or otherwise interrupting the limitation period with continued court proceedings. Some of the countries in which we operate have in recent years changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt the limitation period, or have discussed doing so. We constantly monitor any changes in these rules in the countries in which we operate, and, where appropriate, implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations period.

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.43,Key Regulations Affecting the Northern European Division,5.43.3,Enhanced Consumer Protection,"There has been a trend in recent years to afford more protection to consumers. Various laws, regulations and judicial decisions in jurisdictions in which we operate have changed the way we operate and some have negatively impacted our financial condition. Consumer protection laws can limit our ability to enforce debt claims. For example, in Finland, the enforcement of a consumer debt claim in the event of a default by the customer is subject to restrictions, such as a minimum period of time having passed since the payment due date and a minimum proportion of the debt remaining outstanding. Further, enforcement is prohibited if the payment default of the consumer customer is due to social force majeure, such as illness or unemployment, or other circumstance beyond the customer’s control, unless it would be perceptibly unreasonable to the creditor in the circumstances. Similar laws exist in other jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, in Denmark, debt collection must be carried out in accordance with good practice (God inkassoskik), which limits the measures that a creditor or its servicer may take to collect debt. In addition, a claim against a debtor may only be enforced before the courts if the creditor has forwarded a written demand and at least 10 days have passed. A debtor’s assets may be protected against execution by the Bailiff’s Court, based on the rule of principle that a debtor must be able to uphold a respectable/minimum standard of living (trangsbeneficiet), regardless of the circumstances that gave rise to the claim. In Norway, debt collection must be carried out in accordance with good practice (God inkassoskikk). Before court collection proceedings can be initiated, the debtor must have received a pre-warning, either as part of a written demand for payment or as a separate notice specifying an additional deadline for payment of no less than 14 days from submission. Court collection proceedings cannot be initiated before the relevant deadline for payment has expired and the debt collection agency has considered whether the claim is justified. Certain countries in which we have operations have taken steps to facilitate debt restructuring by individuals, whereby a payment plan for all outstanding indebtedness is initiated. After making all payments pursuant the payment plan, the customer is no longer liable to pay any of the debt included in the debt reconstruction. In Sweden, a new Debt Reconstruction Act (Sw. Skuldsaneringslag 2016:675) came into effect on November 1, 2016, under which eligible customers may, under certain circumstances, be allowed a payment plan shorter than the normal five years. In Norway, a debt reconstruction may involve either a delay in payment of all or part of a debt; the creditors waiving, in whole or in part, their claims on interest or fees; and/or the customer no longer being liable to pay the debt after a particular period of time. In Denmark, the Bankruptcy Court may, by petition from the debtor, grant an eligible debtor partial debt relief and/or reconstruction of debt. The Bankruptcy Court determines eligibility on a case-by-case basis. In Finland, the district court approves the payment plan, the duration of which is set up in the Act on the Adjustment of the Debts of a Private Individual (57/1993, as amended, Laki yksityishenkilön velkajärjestelystä). Customers may also become subject to insolvency proceedings which may result in a delay or prevention in the enforcement of the claims transferred to us, including reductions in principal or interest. Collection of unsecured claims in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency is generally limited by means of the funds available for distribution from the insolvent estate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Other countries have targeted particular types of consumer credit ----- agreements. For example, in Danish consumer credit agreements with respect to short term loans (i.e., loans with a repayment falling within three months from the granting of the loan), there is the mandatory two day waiting period from the offer of a loan to its acceptance by the consumer. Another pronounced effect of this enhanced focus on consumer credit has been to increase the scope of which entities must hold a consumer credit license. In reaction to a recent European Court of Justice case, Verein _für Konsumenteninformation v INKO, Inkasso GmbH, that held debt collection companies were credit_ intermediaries and thus not required to provide pre-contractual information to consumers, many countries took legislative action to impose a requirement on debt collection companies to register with the local authority or obtain a consumer credit license.

Although based on a regulation and directly applicable in all member states, the GDPR contains several opening clauses, where by member states may enact specific national rules in specified areas. This entails that slightly different data protection requirements may apply to each of our subsidiaries within the EU. The requirements include that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and may only be processed in a manner consistent with these purposes. Further, personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and/or processed and it must not be kept for a longer period of time than necessary for the purposes of the collection.

As these regulations are not based on EU legislation, each country has developed its own requirements relating to the investment in debt portfolios. In some cases, our entity is licensed as a financial undertaking by the local financial supervisory authority for purchasing debt portfolios from financial institutions and is required to hold a type of bank or credit license for its debt purchasing operations. In some jurisdictions, purchasing performing mortgages portfolios could trigger certain requirements, such as having to obtain a credit license, comply with AML measures or maintain a certain level of civil liability insurance. Many countries specifically regulate the assignment of debt claims to other parties. For example, in Norway, such contracts can only be assigned without consent of the debtor to other financial institutions, nondefaulted loans can (with certain exemptions) only be acquired by financial institutions and the transfer of a loan portfolio of significance for any of the involved entities requires regulatory consent.

Both models falls within the definition of debt collection services (inkassovirksomhet) as defined the Norwegian Debt Collection Act of 1988 (the “DCA”). In relation to the purchase of claims model, Section 45 of the Financial Contracts Act of 1999 sets out that transfer of claims originated by a financial institution, municipality or county council requires the debtors’ express consent unless the purchaser is licensed as a bank, credit institution, financing company or similar. Hence, in order for such claims to be transferred without customer consent, the debt collection agency needs to be licensed as such financing undertaking. The debt collection agency must fulfil applicable requirements set out in Section 4 of the DCA. Among other things, the agency must be registered in the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises, hold a debt collection license (unless licensed as a lawyer or financial institution) and maintain a guarantee(by way of depositing a security statement from an insurance company with the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (the “NFSA”)) and the manager must have a personal debt collection license. The NFSA will assess whether members of the board of directors, managing director, major owners and manager with the debt collection license are suitable and of good repute. Debt collection agencies being licensed as financing companies must comply with requirements similar to those which apply to banks and credit institutions. ----- The DCA and the Debt Collection Regulation of 1989 sets out detailed regulations as to when written payment reminders, notices of debt collection and demands for payment may be sent to debtors and the maximum fees that may be charged. As a general rule, the debtor is required to compensate the creditor’s necessary collection costs, including those costs that are incurred by engaging a debt collection agency. If the debt collection agency charges the creditor costs within certain defined maximum amounts, the creditor can claim compensation for those costs from the debtor. If the creditor has incurred out of court debt recovery costs that exceed those maximum amounts, the creditor may only in certain cases demand reimbursement of the actual costs. The debt collection agency must act in accordance with good debt collection practice and observe applicable requirements on handling of debtors and customers. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway has provided further guidance in circulars and precedent cases. Complaints against debt collection agencies and other disputes with debtors can be brought before the Finance Complaints Board (Finansklagenemnda). For example, in October 2018 the Norwegian Ministry of Justice appointed a committee to review the DCA, including fee structures set forth therein. The DCA Committee is composed of representatives from the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, financial supervisory authorities, the consumer protection council, the banking and finance industry and from the debt collection industry. The DCA Committee presented their report on January 27, 2020 for consideration by the Norwegian Ministry of Justice. The DCA Committee’s proposal would reduce the amount of collection fees that may be charged on a sliding scale depending on the size of the overall claim, with the most significant reduction for smaller claims. The proposal has not yet been enacted. Although the DCA Committee’s review remains ongoing, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated changes to fee regulations. In response to the pandemic, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice issued an extraordinary public consultation, and on June 19, 2020 approved a measure to reduce collection fees by up to 50% on claims falling due after October 1, 2020 for claims maturing thereafter. The June 2020 fee reductions are more targeted towards larger claims than the reductions set forth in the DCA Committee’s proposal and are expected to remain in effect until the legislative process is complete. Other elements of the review will continue to be considered as part of the legislative process. Although the June 2020 fee reductions will have less of an effect on our business than the reductions proposed by the DCA Committee, as they are targeted at larger claims, we believe that the June 2020 fee reductions will negatively impact the collections, results of operations and profitability of our Norwegian operations.

Private Capital (“PC”) is the private equity arm of OTPP and is an important element of the organization’s overall investment program. OTPP’s status as an unlimited life fund with long-dated pension liabilities and a strong desire to grow its direct private equity portfolio allows for the adoption of a differentiated approach to its investments. PC’s mandate is to deliver superior riskadjusted returns over the long term by focusing on sustainable value creation, and PC is not required or expected to generate short-term gains or provide liquidity for the pension plan. Hence, PC focuses on long-term value creation, not on short-term profits or financial engineering, and PC has the ability and the desire to hold attractive investments for extended periods without regard to artificial investment horizons. With approximately 85 investment professionals and over C$39.3 billion in assets under management, PC manages direct private equity investments and co-investments around the world.

PCS has sold non-performing receivables to Milla for a certain purchase price in 2013 and has sold additional non-performing receivables to Milla for a certain purchase price in 2014 (together, the “PCS Portfolios”). IBW has sold non-performing receivables to Milla for a certain purchase price in 2014 (the “IBW Portfolio” and, together with the Milla Portfolio and the PCS Portfolios, the “Portfolios”). The respective Milla Sellers each provides certain representations and warranties for the benefit of Milla as purchaser. The breach of some of the representations and warranties which relate to the sold receivables, may result in an obligation of the Milla Seller to repurchase the affected sold receivable upon request from Milla at a percentage of the pro rata share of the purchase price for the affected receivable by nominal outstanding balance of the receivable plus interest accrued at a certain percentage until repurchase. Under the Receivables Purchase Agreements, Milla has appointed the respective Milla Seller under that Receivables Purchase Agreement (each, a “Servicer”) to service on behalf of Milla the receivables sold by that Milla Seller for certain customary fees. Lowell Holdco GmbH has subcontracted the actual servicing activities to its subsidiaries SIR, GPP, PCS, IBW, and ZYK as sub-servicers (the “Sub-Servicers”) which hold a collection license pursuant to the German Act on Legal Services (Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz). The Sub-Servicers have confirmed the sub-services in a separate agreement with Milla. ----- _Senior and Subordinated Funding_ Milla has financed the payment of the purchase price for the acquisition of the Portfolios through funding by way of certain senior loan agreements entered into between, inter alios, Milla as borrower and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC as original lender (the “Senior Loan Agreements”) and certain subordinated loan agreements entered into between Milla as borrower and the respective Milla Seller as subordinated lender (the “Subordinated Loan Agreements”). Payments by Milla of amounts owing by it are made pursuant to certain priority of payment waterfalls (the “Priority of Payments”) set out in the documents. With respect to Lowell Holdco GmbH and PCS as Milla Sellers of the German Retailer Portfolio and the PCS Portfolios, Milla has entered into a senior loan agreement with Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC as original lender and certain other transaction parties (as amended and restated on March 19, 2014, including an increase of the commitment of the original lender). With respect to IBW as Milla Seller of the IBW Portfolio, Milla has entered into a senior loan agreement with Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC as original lender and certain other transaction parties. Milla is obliged to repay the Senior Loans in certain amounts on each payment date in accordance with the Priority of Payments. The remainder shall be repaid at a certain repayment date. No amount repaid may be re-borrowed. The lenders under the Senior Loan Agreements are entitled to transfer all of their rights and obligations under the Senior Loan Agreements to Lowell Holdco GmbH for a price being equal to the principal amount outstanding under the Senior Loan Agreements, accrued and unpaid interest and outstanding costs, for a period of one month after becoming aware of a change of control and if the cash payments actually provided are more than 20% below the planned expected cash flows on average over any aggregated period of three consecutive months at any time during the life of the Milla Securitisation (the “Milla Put”). A “change of control” occurs, inter alia, if any person or persons acting in concert acquire directly or indirectly more than 50% (or 30% after an initial public offering) of the shares in Lowell Holdco GmbH (or the respective subsidiary of Lowell Holdco GmbH acting as seller under the related Receivables Purchase Agreement) or such number of shares in Lowell Holdco GmbH (or the respective subsidiary of Lowell Holdco GmbH acting as seller under the related Receivables Purchase Agreement) carrying more than 50% of the voting rights normally exercisable at the general meetings of Lowell Holdco GmbH or the respective subsidiary. The obligations of Milla as borrower under the Senior Loan Agreements are secured by pledges over the respective operating accounts, assignment of all rights and claims under the fiduciary agreements regarding the collection accounts held by the servicers for the benefit of Milla and assignment of rights and claims of Milla under the transaction documents (excluding the Subordinated Loan Agreements). The Senior Loan Agreements contain certain negative and affirmative undertakings as well as a series of customary termination grounds, such as failure to pay, breach of other obligations, misrepresentation, insolvency, insolvency proceedings, creditors’ process, unlawfulness and repudiation and material litigation. In the event that Lowell Holdco GmbH were to be replaced as servicer under the Receivables Purchase Agreement relating to the Milla Portfolio, Lowell Holdco GmbH is entitled to demand transfer of all of the rights and obligations under the Senior Loan Agreements to itself. Lowell Holdco GmbH, PCS and IBW as lenders have granted subordinated loans to Milla as borrower. The claims of the lenders under the Subordinated Loan Agreements rank junior to those of the lenders under the Senior Loan Agreements. Disbursement of each of the loans under the Subordinated Loan Agreements is set off in a corresponding amount against the purchase price payable to the Milla Seller under the respective Receivables Purchase Agreement and the sellers therefore did not receive the full purchase price in cash.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law ----- which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Notes. “EURIBOR,” with respect to a Euro Floating Rate Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Euro Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11.00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Euro Determination Date.

If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Euro Floating Rate Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11.00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Euro Determination Date, for loans in a Euro Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Euro Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Euro Floating Rate Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Euro Floating Rate Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Euro Floating Rate Interest Period. If, ----- in any case, that rate determined in accordance with the above is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero. If the Issuer determines that the EURIBOR rate is no longer being calculated or administered, or it becomes illegal for the Calculation Agent to determine any amounts due to be paid pursuant to then-existing EURIBOR, as at the relevant Euro Determination Date, any alternative rate which has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Issuer, in consultation with an Independent Financial Advisor appointed by the Issuer, and promptly thereafter notified by the Issuer to the Holders and the Calculation Agent, shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the new rate replacing EURIBOR (the “EURIBOR Successor Rate”) in lieu of the replacement rate described in the definition of “EURIBOR”; _provided, however, that if the Independent Financial Advisor determines that there is no clear market consensus as to whether any rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage, the Independent Financial Advisor shall determine an appropriate alternative rate (and any applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR) to be the EURIBOR Successor Rate, and the decision of the Independent Financial Advisor will be binding on the Issuer, the Calculation Agent and the Holders, and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least two Business Days prior to any Euro Determination Date, such EURIBOR Successor Rate (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further inquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Euro Applicable Floating Rate; provided further that any such alternative rate adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0.00%.

Following the adoption of the EURIBOR Successor Rate pursuant to this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative rate. “Euro Determination Date” with respect to a Euro Floating Rate Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Euro Floating Rate Interest Period. “Euro Floating Rate Interest Period” means, with respect to the Floating Rate Euro Notes, the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Euro Floating Rate Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include   , 2021. “Euro Representative Amount” means the greater of (1) € 1.0 million and (2) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “Eurozone” means the region comprising member states of the European Union that adopt the euro. “Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open. The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Euro Determination Date, determine the Euro Applicable Floating Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Euro Floating Rate Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Euro Applicable Floating Rate to the principal amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Euro Floating Rate Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Euro Floating Rate Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Euro Applicable Floating Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties.

Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts (as defined below) will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Euro Notes or the Sterling Notes, as applicable. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and - each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer. A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election, who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been accepted by the Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Notes from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. ----- The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on _Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant)._ For purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the pound sterling equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower pound sterling equivalent, as applicable), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than pound sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable pound sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such pound sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the pound sterling equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the pound sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in pound sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, prior to acceleration, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

Withholding Tax","For German tax residents (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management and control is located in Germany), interest payments will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are held in custody with or administered by or presented for an over-the-counter-payment to a German branch of a German or non-German bank or financial services institution, a German securities trading company or a German securities trading bank (each, a “Disbursing Agent,” _auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total_ withholding being 26.375%). For individual holders of Notes subject to church tax, an electronic information system for church withholding tax purposes applies, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the holders will be assessed to church tax. The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest,” _Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period_ provided that the Notes have been held in a custodial account or administered with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. Where Notes are acquired and/or sold or redeemed in a currency other than Euro, the sales/redemption price and the acquisition costs have to be converted into Euro on the basis of the foreign exchange rates prevailing on the sale or redemption date and the acquisition date respectively with the result that any currency gains or losses are part of the capital gains. If interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposal are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the payment of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately. To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European Union, the European Economic Area or certain other countries, e.g., in the countries/territories Swiss Confederation, Principality of Liechtenstein, Republic of San Marino, Principality of Monaco, Principality of Andorra, Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds must, also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs. ----- In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent generally deducts from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other capital investments with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent also deducts Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent credits foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent. Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene _Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross_ payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the competent tax authorities. German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met. Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are held in a custodial account with, with, are administered by or presented for an over-the-counter payment to a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer_Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible. The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under “— _Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept_ in custody abroad or of no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process. If the withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), the individual holder may and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following assessment periods. ----- Pursuant to recent legislative changes, losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party or from any other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of EUR 10,000 per year. Where Notes form part of a trade or business, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz) applicable to the investor. If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method. _Non-Tax Residents_ This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not located in Germany). Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except for the discussion and on FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”). This discussion does not address the impact of the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust (a) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (b) if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

Interest generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the payment received in respect of the accrued interest income, determined at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously accrued in respect of such payment (as described above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, and for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations.

In the event that the Sterling Notes, the Floating Rate Euro Notes or the Fixed Rate Euro Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders of such series of Notes issued with OID generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. A series of Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such series exceeds its issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount, multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event that a Note is issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds the Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all ----- principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price of the Floating Rate Euro Notes only, the amounts of stated interest and OID on a Floating Rate Euro Note is determined by assuming that the interest rate is based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Floating Rate Euro Note as of the issue date. OID generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in the applicable foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as receipts of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipts of principal. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, and for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot rate on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects as described below, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on the spot rate on the date payment is received or the Note is disposed of. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes such election, the election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount thereof generally will be ordinary income or loss and, generally will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined based on the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined based on the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments _of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable) will be realized only to the extent of the total_ gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. ----- Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition.

Debt obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payment” are filed generally would be “grandfathered” (and therefore not subject to withholding or such payments under FATCA) unless such obligations are materially modified after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA is expected to apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of the grandfathering period. Under proposed Treasury Regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on any Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the ----- Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining “foreign passthru payments.” Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued.

However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in the form proposed on February 14, 2013, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) under certain circumstances. Until recently, the FTT proposal was at a standstill at the level of the European Council. Following the meeting of the Council of the EU of June 14, 2019, the FTT currently being considered by the Participating Member States would be levied on the acquisition of shares or similar instruments of listed companies which have their head office in a member state of the EU (and market capitalization in excess of €1 billion on December 1 of the preceding year), rather than on any type of financial instrument. In order to reach a final agreement among the Participating Member States, further work in the Council and its preparatory bodies will be required in order to ensure that the competences, rights and obligations of non-participating EU member states are respected. If the proposed directive or any similar tax was adopted and depending on the final terms and scope of the FTT, transactions on the Notes could be subject to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market of the Notes may be diminished. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States and is the subject of legal challenge. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate. Subject to the final scope of any FTT, holders of the Notes could be exposed to higher transaction fees and prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the forms of Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Listing and General Information.” The gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with the Equity Contribution from the Parent, will be used, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of _Proceeds,” (i) to redeem the Existing Notes, (ii) to partially repay drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility,_ (iii) to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions and (iv) for general corporate purposes, which may include future debt portfolio purchases or repayment or redemption of Indebtedness. Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis. See “—The Note Guarantees.” The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted _Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our_ Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. A fiduciary of an ERISA Plan should consider the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment in determining whether an investment in the Notes satisfies these requirements. Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of us, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the agents and our and their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser.

Such transactions are referred to as “prohibited transactions” and include, without limitation, (1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Transaction Parties are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless ----- the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. The U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the sale, purchase or holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code each provide a limited exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that (i) neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates directly or indirectly have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and (ii) the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied at the time the Notes are acquired by a purchaser or transferee, or thereafter, if the facts relied upon for utilizing a prohibited transaction exemption change. Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain church plans and non-U.S. plans which are not subject to ERISA and the Code may contain fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction requirements similar to those under Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should consider the impact of Similar Laws on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Further, if the purchaser or subsequent transferee is an ERISA Plan, such purchaser or subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that (i) none of Transaction Parties have acted as the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary (within the meaning of ERISA or the Code), or has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the purchaser or transferee’s decision to acquire and hold the Notes, and (ii) the Transaction Parties shall not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of such Note or any interest therein.

Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may change the price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their respective affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by its counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer, the Guarantors and their subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement until the date falling    days after the date of the final offering memorandum without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers. The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Important Information” and “Transfer Restrictions.” Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a Qualified Investor.

Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to _Prospective U.S. Investors” and “Notice to Certain European and United Kingdom Investors.” If a jurisdiction_ requires that the offering be made by a broker or dealer that is licensed in that jurisdiction, any offering that is made in such jurisdiction shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers or any affiliates thereof that is or are licensed as a broker or dealer in that jurisdiction. The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer will apply, through its listing agent, Carey Olsen Corporate Finance Limited (“the Listing Agent”), to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that the listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained. Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be         business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T +         ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the following         business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Managers, or person(s) acting on behalf of the Stabilization Manager, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the relevant Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase the relevant Notes in the open ----- markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of such Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also over-allot the offering of the relevant Notes creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase relevant Notes in the open market to cover the applicable syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase relevant Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the relevant Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these activities, and the Stabilizing Managers may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes— _There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and/or commercial banking services (including hedging) to us and our affiliates, including our shareholders, in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. Affiliates of the Initial Purchasers are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and affiliates of an Initial Purchaser have invested in securities of an affiliate of the Issuer. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Furthermore, such entities may act as counterparties in the hedging arrangements we or our affiliates, including our shareholders, expect to enter into in connection with the Transactions and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. In the ordinary course of its business activities, each Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates, including our shareholders. If the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, including our shareholders, they may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us or our affiliates in a manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Each purchaser of the Notes hereunder (other than each of the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented, warranted and agreed with the Issuer, any Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A and Regulation S are used herein as defined therein): 1. it understands and acknowledges that (i) the Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and that the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and (ii) unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, or in any transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) below; 2. it understands and acknowledges the Issuer has not been registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act and the Issuer is exempt from registration as such by virtue of Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment Company Act excepts from the provisions of the U.S. Investment Company Act those issuers who privately place their securities solely to persons who at the time of purchase are QPs. In general terms, QP means, among other things, any natural person who owns not less than U.S. $5,000,000 in investments; any person who in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis, not less than U.S. $25,000,000 in investments; and trusts as to which both the settlor and the decision-making trustee are qualified purchasers (but only if such trust was not formed for the specific purpose of making such investment); 3. it is neither the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) nor acting on the Issuer’s behalf and it is either (a) both a QIB and a QP and it is aware that any sale of these Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another person that is both a QIB and a QP, or (b) it is outside the United States and purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S and it is not a retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom (for these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(a) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation (a “Qualified Investor”); 4. it acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of the foregoing, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or sale of any Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as it has deemed ----- necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum; 5. it is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for an account with respect to which it exercises sole investment discretion and for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes to any person that is both a QIB and a QP pursuant to Rule 144A or in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S; 6. it understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing Notes resold pursuant to Rule 144A, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Rule 144A Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year after the later of the Issue Date and the last date on which the Issuer or any of their affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) only (a) to the Issuer or any subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the U.S Securities Act, (c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is both a QIB and a QP that purchases for its own account or for the account of another person that is both a QIB and a QP to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S or (e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s, the Transfer Agents’ and the Registrars’ right prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (e) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing in the Indenture is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Transfer Agent or the Registrar.

FURTHER, IF THE PURCHASER OR SUBSEQUENT TRANSFEREE IS AN ERISA PLAN, SUCH PURCHASER OR SUBSEQUENT TRANSFEREE WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE REPRESENTED AND WARRANTED THAT (1) NONE OF THE ISSUER, GUARANTORS OR THE INITIAL PURCHASERS OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES (THE “TRANSACTION PARTIES”) HAS ACTED AS THE ERISA PLAN’S FIDUCIARY (WITHIN THE MEANING OF ERISA OR THE CODE), OR HAS BEEN RELIED UPON FOR ANY ADVICE, WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASER OR TRANSFEREE’S DECISION TO ACQUIRE AND HOLD THE SECURITIES, AND (2) THE TRANSACTION PARTIES SHALL NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH SECURITIES OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN OTHERWISE THAN TO A PURCHASER OR TRANSFEREE THAT IS DEEMED TO MAKE THESE SAME REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PURCHASE AND HOLDING OF SUCH SECURITIES OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN. If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these notes. 8. it agrees that it will, and each subsequent holder is required to, give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on the transfer of such Notes, if then applicable; 9. it acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A; 10. it acknowledges that the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with; 11. it acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of its acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements on behalf of each such investor account; 12. it understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by us or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Securities in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth in this Offering Memorandum; 13. it confirms that you, or the investor account for which you act, is not a retail investor. For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: ----- (i) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a Qualified Investor; 14. it understands that: (i) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor (as defined above) in the EEA or the United Kingdom, and (ii) no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation; 15. it understands that the Issuer and each of the Guarnators will be a “covered fund” as defined in the Volcker Rule in the absence of an exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. The definition of “covered fund” in the Volcker Rule includes, among other things, any entity that would be an “investment company” under the U.S. Investment Company Act but for the exclusion provided under Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer and each of the Guarantors relies on Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment Company Act for their exemption from registration thereunder (which limits sales of the Notes to “qualified purchasers” as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act), they will be“covered funds” for purposes of the Volcker Rule in the absence of an exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. Accordingly, “banking entities” (as defined under the Volcker Rule) that are subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited under the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or any of the Guarantors as a “covered fund”, absent any applicable exclusion from the definition of “covered fund” or exemption under the Volcker Rule. Under the Volcker Rule, “ownership interest” is defined broadly to include any equity, partnership or other similar interest, and the phrase “other similar interest” is further defined to include any participation or other interest that entitles the holder of such interest to, amongst other things: (a) participate in the selection or removal of management or otherwise (other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of default or acceleration event and to participate in the removal of an investment manager for “cause” (as defined therein) or in the selection of a replacement manager upon an investment manager’s resignation or removal), (b) share in the income, gains or profits of the “covered fund”, (c) receive underlying assets of the “covered fund” after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of default or acceleration event), (d) receive all or a portion of excess spread (as defined therein), (e) provide under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the “covered fund with respect to the interest can be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the “covered fund”, (f) receive income on a pass-through basis from the “covered fund” or have a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the “covered fund”, or (g) any synthetic right to have, receive or be allocated any of the rights in clauses (a) through (f) above; and 16. it represents and warrant that either (i) no portion of the assets used by purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any “employee benefit plan” subject to Title I of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”), any plan, individual retirement account or other arrangement subject to Section 4975 of the Code, an entity whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” (pursuant to Section 3(42) of ERISA and regulations promulgated under ERISA by the U.S. Department of Labor) of such employee benefit plans, plans, accounts or arrangements (collectively, “ERISA Plans”) or a governmental plan, church plan or non-U.S. plan, subject to provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”) or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes or an interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws. Further, if the purchaser or subsequent transferee is an ERISA Plan, such purchaser or subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that (i) none of the Issuer, Guarantors or the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective affiliate (the “Transaction Parties”) has acted as the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary (within the meaning of ERISA or the Code), or has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the purchaser or transferee’s decision to acquire and hold the Notes, and (ii) the Transaction Parties shall not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of such Note or any interest therein. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,Germany,23.1.1,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A conclusive judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional competence according to German law; - the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of non-compliance with such requirement, (i) the defendant does not invoke such non-compliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the proceedings; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the applicable judgment does not contradict any such judgment under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany (Grundrechte); - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced. Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce ----- the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636
1807_2,Offerings 2020.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.2,Luxembourg,23.2.1,,"The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer is located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (executoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the applicable matter under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the U.S. court is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law; - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules (according to certain Luxembourg case law, it is admitted that Luxembourg courts which are asked to grant an exequatur do not have to verify whether the substantive law actually applied by the U.S. court awarding the judgment was the law which would have been thus designated; - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi _luxembourgeoise)._ Please note that Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility may change: additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other conditions may not be verified by Luxembourg courts in the future. ----- Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although such a review is not statutorily prohibited. We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not bona fide or if the foreign law was not pleaded or proved or if pleaded and proved, the foreign law was contrary to Luxembourg mandatory provisions (lois impératives) or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules, and (ii) if its application is manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are, among other things, to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States in national legislation (subject to the debtor meeting certain conditions), (b) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class, (c) in a restructuring plan all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a sufficient commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes) and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority.

Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended from time to time remains applicable to insolvency proceedings opened before that date. Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State (other than Denmark) in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States (other than Denmark) may have differing and even conflicting views. Under Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court that is requested to open insolvency proceedings shall examine, of its own motion, whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The EU Insolvency Regulation includes, among others, specifications regarding the identification of the center of main interests. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, in the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State (other than Denmark) within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in another Member State (other than Denmark) than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the center of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g. by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means). Another change under the EU Insolvency Regulation focuses on the definition of “establishment” as a prerequisite to open “territorial insolvency proceedings” (secondary insolvency proceedings).

In the event of any insolvency of such Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not organized under German law (for example, if the centre of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. See “Certain _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—European Union.”_ The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors ----- and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court _ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Antrag auf Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that, according to German case law, the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due within the next three weeks for a period longer than three weeks. A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless, based on the prevailing circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich). A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debt when they fall due. In addition, only the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk for the company of being unable to pay its debt as and when_ they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder or partner gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the managing director(s) or under certain circumstances the shareholders of such company must file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay but in any event no later than three weeks after such company has become illiquid and/or over-indebted. The management of a debtor can be exposed to criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event that filings for insolvency are delayed or not made at all. If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third-party perspective—there is no reasonable chance of a successful restructuring. In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor must prepare an insolvency plan which will ideally be implemented in formal debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (as amended the “COVInsAG”), provides, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency due to over-indebtedness until December 31, 2020. The suspension – as in force from October 1, 2020 – applies unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVInsAG also provides for a relief from claw-back, if the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of filing duties, for the satisfaction of claims or the provision of collateral for these claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in possession-proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of ----- the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. This only applies, where the debtor has not applied for so-called debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger _Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three_ requirements: - a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over-indebted); - revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or - 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis. The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der _Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter). The court opens_ formal insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements are met (in particular, but not limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is usually appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to wind down the debtor. Satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against a company subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of assets of a German subsidiary of the Issuer would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by management of a German subsidiary of the Issuer after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of a German subsidiary of the Issuer’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against German subsidiaries of the Issuer may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency ----- proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder _Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not_ to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)) who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is—in principle—subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Certain secured creditors have preferential rights regarding the enforcement of their security interests, but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security. The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte)) as well as (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Massekosten) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case law, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its ----- secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described above) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the holders of the Notes. If a German subsidiary or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting from such collateral securing creditors other than the holders of the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Note Guarantees granted by the German Guarantors after satisfaction of such secured creditors. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An alternative distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Recently a new insolvency law on group of companies has entered into force on April 21, 2018 to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz _zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), mainly intended to provide for a better coordination_ of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. It does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.” If the circumstances for a suspension of filing obligations as set out above are met, the COVInsAG also provides for a relief from lender liability, as any new loans or the provision of collateral for such loans is not regarded against _bonos mores. This relief includes deferrals and “amend & extend” transactions. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Guarantees and any other security granted by a GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or security interest agree to enforce the guarantees or security interest against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH’s net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any security and Note Guarantee provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH (incorporated or established in Germany) will contain such limitation language in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Note Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving case law. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of German (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes, of the subsidiaries to make payments on the guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the collateral or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees. Notwithstanding that the incurrence of the Note Guarantees by (German) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer should, as of today, not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of such German Guarantor, the enforcement of the Note Guarantees and security interests granted by such German Guarantors may be excluded, according to certain provisions contained in the limitation language, if any high court decisions (höchstrichterliche Entscheidung) of a German Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) or the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) holding that the granting of a guarantee and/or security to secure any obligation of an affiliated company within the meaning of Section 15 AktG of such guarantor and/or security grantor (other than any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) in comparable circumstances may nevertheless in case of the enforcement of such guarantee and/or security trigger any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG. The limitations set out above apply mutatis mutandis if the Guarantee or security is granted by a German Guarantor incorporated or established in Germany as a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) (including, without limitation, IBW) with a general partner (Komplementär) organized in the legal form of (i) a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or (ii) an entrepreneurs company with limited liability (Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)), in relation to such general partner (Komplementär).",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the Indenture (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”). The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the security providers under the Notes and the Note Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, ----- pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Security Providers for the full principal amount of the Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

On the basis of these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) transactions which are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings, subject to specific periods. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. If the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the security were avoided, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency proceedings in the amount of their original investment and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received by the insolvency estate or to waive such Note Guarantee or security interest. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases, as amended by the act to improve legal certainty with respect to avoidance claims under the German Insolvency Code and the German Code on Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung _und dem Anfechtungsgesetz) which became effective on April 5, 2017:_ - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of the circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that imperatively suggested such illiquidity or filing); - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (or guarantees) (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggested such detrimental effect); ----- - a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intent to prejudice its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary knew of such intention at the time of such act. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the avoidability of acts is limited to four years. “Knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the other party knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. In case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the_ creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments shall establish the rebuttable presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded more than two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or a similar claim if (i) in case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and - any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debt generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general ----- statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. The COVInsAG, however, provides for a privileged treatment of any kind of newly granted third party financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial credits and other forms of financing) and shareholder loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties. This privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favor of third party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar acts. Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of_ any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. During the suspension of filing obligations as set out above, the COVInsAG also provides for a relief from lender liability, as any new loans or the provision of collateral for such loans is not regarded against bonos mores. This relief shall include deferrals and “amend & extend” transactions. The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future. On June 20, 2019, the EU Restructuring Directive has been adopted. The EU Restructuring Directive was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on June 26, 2019, and the member states have approximately two years to transpose the substantive parts of the EU Restructuring Directive into their national legislation, although a one-year extension can be granted. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the EU Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The EU Restructuring Directive sets out minimum standards to be applied by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization). Although certain features of the EU Restructuring Directive need to be transposed into national legislation, the EU Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of certain other features. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers and against the voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e. outside formal insolvency proceedings. The EU Restructuring Directive also provides for cross-class cram-down, i.e. even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into national legislation. The implementation of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing. See also “—European Union—EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks.” On September 19, 2020, the German ministry of justice and consumer protection published a ministerial draft bill (Referentenentwurf), followed by a draft bill (Regierungsentwurf) published on October 14, 2020 by the German Federal Government on a Law on Development of Restructuring and Insolvency Laws (Gesetz zur _Fortentwicklung des Sanierungs- und Insolvenzrechts, SanInsFoG), providing in particular for the implementation_ of the EU Restructuring Directive into German law and stipulating certain other amendments of German ----- insolvency laws, e.g. the implementation of the framework for an optional restructuring plan, the option for proceedings led by the debtor and modular proceedings, a moratorium even before insolvency proceedings are opened as well as certain measures due to consequences from COVID-19. According to the current draft the law shall enter into force on January 1, 2021. This timing as well as the scope of regulations law are (as long as not determined by the EU Restructuring Directive) still subject to changes in the on-going legislative process (Gesetzgebungsverfahren).",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be initiated against a company having its center of main interests or an establishment (both terms within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in Luxembourg: - bankruptcy proceedings (“faillite”), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by any of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (“cessation des paiements”) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (“ébranlement de crédit”). The main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of managers’/directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with Article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code; - controlled management proceedings (“gestion contrôlée”), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see the below applicable provision of the Financial Collateral Law 2005); - composition proceedings (“concordat préventif de la faillite”), the opening of which may only be requested by the company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to composition ----- proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except for secured creditors (please see the below applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005); or - in addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (“sursis de paiement”) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (“liquidation judiciaire”). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Companies Law 1915. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of a Luxembourg company in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum social salary); - employees’ contributions to social security; - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - employer’s contribution to social security; - landlords, for certain unpaid sums due to them; and - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). Favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments securing monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments) pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Article 20 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as well as valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the prebankruptcy preference period (période suspecte) against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud). Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Law 2005. If Article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied (save in the case of fraud). Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement. _Impact of insolvency proceedings on transactions_ During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A ----- reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Issuer’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of default may still be served. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the preference period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months plus ten days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular: - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de Commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and - pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and Article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg company’s business and assets and such Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes. Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 as described above and Article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation).",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The granting of any financial collateral governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005 must be capable of being evidenced in writing. However, additional steps may be required to enforce security interests against third parties. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts will generally apply, in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over the assets subject to such security interests, the law of the place where such assets subject are situated (lex rei sitae or _lex situs). As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims having debtors located in Luxembourg and/or governed by Luxembourg law, securities which are held through an account located (or deemed to be located) in Luxembourg and bearer securities physically held in Luxembourg. ----- If certain assets are located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The creation, validity and enforcement of security interests such as pledges and transfer of ownership as security, granted on financial instruments and claims (in order to secure cash settlement and/or delivery of financial instruments) are notably governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005, a pledge (gage) is effected by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party acting as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights over the pledged assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession of such assets. A physical transfer of possession not being possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides for a fictitious transfer of possession (i.e. perfection) which is effected by mechanisms which depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares and other registered instruments, the dispossession is validly realized by notifying the pledge to the issuer of such shares/instruments or by an acceptance of the pledge by the issuer of such shares/instruments who in turn will proceed to an entry of the pledge in the share register/the register of the relevant instruments (as applicable) held by the issuer of such shares/instruments. In case of cash bank accounts held in Luxembourg with a Luxembourg bank, the account-holding bank generally has a first-ranking security right over the accounts and the balances thereof. Hence, a pledge over such cash bank accounts is validly created and the dispossession is validly realized by notifying the pledge to the firstranking security beneficiary/the holder of the pledged accounts (i.e. the account-holding bank) and by the acceptance of the pledge by such security beneficiary/holder of the pledged accounts, who in turn would normally also waive its first-ranking security rights over the bank accounts concerned. If future bank accounts are pledged, an additional notification to, and acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required for both the creation and the perfection of the pledge over such future bank accounts. A pledge granted over intragroup receivables is perfected once the relevant pledge agreement has been entered into by all parties thereto. However, in order for the debtor under the pledged receivables not to be able to validly liberate itself from its payment obligations thereunder by paying the pledgor instead of the Security Agent, when the pledge agreement provides that such payment shall inure to the Security Agent, the debtor of such receivables needs to be notified of or has to accept the pledge granted thereover. The above perfection steps and actions need to be undertaken by the grantor of the security interest and/or the Security Agent. If the relevant pledgor or the Security Agent fails or is unable to take the necessary steps/actions required to take or perfect any of the above-mentioned security interests, such security interests will not have been created and/or perfected with respect to the claims arising under the Notes. Article 11 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 sets out the following enforcement methods, available upon the occurrence of the relevant enforcement event in respect of a pledge governed by the provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005: - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets (if the pledged assets are listed on an official Luxembourg or foreign stock market or traded on a recognized regulated market open to the public); - selling or causing the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially reasonable terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange, or (iii) by way of a public auction; - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Financial Collateral Law 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, _e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be delayed. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Luxembourg law ----- governed security interests may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located outside of Luxembourg. Security interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third-party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled in priority to the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees and/or security interests, applicable corporate procedures normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that have been appointed for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged guarantees and/or security interests must comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object. The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company,” which is a translation of the French “intérêt social,” an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior.” Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment. In a group context, the interest of the companies of the group taken individually is not entirely eliminated. With respect to guarantors and/or security grantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Companies Law 1915, does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee and/or secure the indebtedness of another entity of the same group, it is generally held that within a group of companies, in the context of a group of related companies, the existence of a group interest in granting upstream or cross-stream assistance under any form (including under the form of guarantee or security) to other group companies could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a Luxembourg company to grant such guarantee or security, provided that the following conditions are met (and subject in any event to all the factual circumstances of the matter): (i) such guarantee or security must be given for the purpose of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group, (ii) the commitment to grant such guarantee or security must not be without consideration and such commitment must not be manifestly disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group companies, and (iii) such guarantee or security granted or any other financial commitments must not exceed the financial capabilities of the committing company. Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee or a security interest on a group level is certainly important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a lack of corporate interest for one or more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate benefit is of particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915. The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability (personal and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. The guarantees or security interests granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Company Law 1915, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may be an interested third party, e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915 will be held null and void. ----- The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment is required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. As a result of the above developments, the guarantees or security interests granted by a Luxembourg company will be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, _inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres) and certain intra-group liabilities), which is inserted in the relevant finance document(s), indenture or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance documents, indentures or guarantee agreements. The registration of the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, Trustee’s accession deed to the Intercreditor Agreement and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) (the “Documents”) is required if such Documents are either (i) attached as an annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire). In such cases, as well as in case of a voluntary registration, the Documents will be subject to registration duties payable by the party registering, or being ordered to register, the Documents. Depending on the nature of the Documents, such registration duties would be ad valorem (such as for instance a registration duty of 0.24% calculated on the amounts mentioned in those agreements) or fixed (such as for instance a registration duty of €12 for a pledge). No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of security interest agreements, which are subject to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Luxembourg courts or official Luxembourg authorities may require (when these are presented before them) that the notes, the security interest agreements, the indentures, the guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security: (i) an administrator appointed to the company which granted the floating charge can dispose of floating charge assets for cash or collect receivables charged by way of floating charge as though they were not subject to the charge, although the holder of the floating charge will have the same priority in respect of the proceeds of sale as he or she had in respect of the property/assets disposed of and where the assets are disposed of for cash, the administrator or liquidator may use the proceeds and/or cash received for assets subject to a floating charge to meet certain statutory administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the charged company’s business whilst it is in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder (see (iii) below); (ii) a fixed charge over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge over the assets, may rank prior to the floating charge over the relevant assets provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge is granted and the fixed charge holder had no notice of any restrictions on the grant of the relevant security interest; (iii) general costs and expenses (including the insolvency office-holder’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up or administration are payable out of floating charge assets, to the extent the assets of the company available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to certain restrictions for the costs ----- of litigation), in priority to floating charge claims (the same does not apply to fixed charge claims); (iv) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of its business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charged company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (v) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law (please see “—Grant of Floating Charge” below); and (vi) where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, floating charge security is (a) subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to employees) and (b) subject to the claims of unsecured creditors in respect of a ring fenced amount of the proceeds (please see “— _Prescribed Part” below) but only to the extent that the assets of the company available for unsecured creditors_ generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to certain restrictions for the costs of litigation incurred in a liquidation). This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of the comparative disadvantages of floating charge security. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where (among other things) the chargee does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof, or does not exercise such control, in practice, as the description given to the charges in the relevant security document as fixed charges are not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The purpose of the administration must be to achieve one of the following successive objectives: (i) rescuing the company as a going concern, or, if that is not reasonably practicable; (ii) achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration), or, if that is not reasonably practicable; (iii) realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferred creditors provided that the interests of creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby. A company may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out of court process. Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration by the court at the application of, among others, the company itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors). An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company itself, its directors or by the holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the company provided that such qualifying floating charge has become enforceable. In addition, the holder of a qualifying floating charge has the right to intervene in an administration application by applying to the court to appoint an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver. For the Security Agent (as the holder of the floating charge security) to be able to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” and further, in the case of the appointment of an administrative receiver, the appointment must not be prohibited by the English Insolvency Act (meaning it must fall within one of the exemptions to the general prohibition which otherwise prevents the appointment of administrative receivers). In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (i) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (ii) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (iii) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by section 29(2) of the English Insolvency Act. The Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together with other forms of security, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant English company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time. The most relevant exception to the general prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the English Insolvency Act), which will ----- apply if: (i) the issue of the Notes creates or is expected to create a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the life of the capital markets arrangement; and (ii) the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (as defined in the English Insolvency Act). A “capital markets investment” includes (among other things) certain debt instruments that fall within the scope of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI 2001/544) and are, or are designed to be, rated, listed or traded. In the case of the Notes, they will be, or are designed to be, rated for the purposes of investment by an internationally recognised rating agency. Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration order (in the case of a court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed with the court. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a full statutory moratorium applies, pursuant to which creditors cannot exercise certain of their rights against the company, including, among other things, commencing a legal process against the company, winding up the company or enforcing security or repossessing goods in the company’s possession under a hire purchase agreement without the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), as amended. The effect of the statutory moratorium is that were an English Guarantor to enter administration, it is possible that the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it (other than security financial collateral arrangements) may not be enforced while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent of the administrator and, if and to the extent that any principal debt or guarantee obligation is owed it could be accelerated or could be demanded (subject to the prohibition on ipso facto termination provisions (see “—Prohibition on ipso _facto termination provisions” below)), but no meaningful enforcement action could be taken in respect of any_ failure to pay. In addition, a secured creditor could not appoint an administrative receiver (to enforce its security), any administrative receiver already appointed would be required to vacate office and any receiver of part of an English Guarantor’s property would be required to resign if requested to do so by the administrator (except a receiver of a part appointed under a charge subject to the application of the Financial Collateral Regulations).",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

There is no automatic statutory moratorium that applies as a result of the liquidation (although in the case of a compulsory winding-up by the courts, no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or continued against the relevant company except with the leave of the court and, in the case of a voluntary liquidation, a liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, may apply for an equivalent stay on proceedings), and the holders of security interests are entitled to take steps to enforce their security interests in all types of liquidation.

Under the English Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the “Prescribed Part” (please see “—Prescribed Part” below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows: _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor,_ but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets; ----- _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of_ priority in which expenses are paid); _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are_ not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. Secondary preferential debts include bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, and rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts. If there are insufficient unsecured asset realizations to satisfy them, these expenses and preferential debts are payable out of floating charge realizations in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder, the expenses being paid in priority to the preferential debts. The Finance Act 2020 (the “Finance Act”) received royal assent on July 22, 2020. Under the Finance Act, HMRC will have secondary preferential creditor status in respect of certain tax debts (such as VAT, Pay As You Earn (PAYE) taxes and employee national insurance contributions). This means that for certain tax debts, HMRC will rank ahead of floating charge holders and unsecured creditors, although behind ordinary preferential creditors. For all other tax debts (such as corporation tax), HMRC will remain an unsecured creditor. These provisions will only apply in formal insolvency cases commencing on or after December 1, 2020. However, floating charges created before that date will still be affected in those formal insolvencies; _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would_ include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (please see “—Prescribed Part” below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; _Fifth ranking:_ - firstly, provable debts of general unsecured creditors. However, any secured creditor not repaid in full from the realization of assets subject to its security can also claim the remaining debt due to it (a shortfall) from the insolvent estate as an unsecured claim. To pay a shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the “Prescribed Part” in respect of a shortfall unless the “Prescribed Part” is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors (please see “—Prescribed Part” below); - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation proceedings, or after the commencement of any administration proceedings which either preceded such liquidation proceedings or which were converted into a liquidating administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds_ exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. In the limited circumstances of a winding-up or administration that occurs within 12 weeks of the new standalone moratorium, the usual order of priority referred to above would be altered to give priority to any moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts (please see “—CIGA order of priority following a _moratorium” below)._ ----- _Prescribed Part_ An administrator, receiver (including an administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the relevant company’s net property subject to the floating charge and 20% of the remainder over £10,000. The maximum aggregate cap was, until recently, £600,000, but from April 6, 2020, the maximum aggregate cap was increased to £800,000. It should be noted that this increase will only apply to floating charges created on or after April 6, 2020, so the increased cap does not apply where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

In most cases this will only arise if an administrator or liquidator is appointed to the company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or security and, in addition, the company was “unable to pay its debts” when the security interest or guarantee was granted or it became “unable to pay its debts” as a result. If security or a guarantee granted by an English Guarantor is challenged under the laws of England and Wales, and the court makes certain findings (as described further below), it may be permitted to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of that an English Guarantor’s obligations under the relevant security and/or guarantee provided by such English Guarantor; - direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid by or realized from such English Guarantor under a guarantee or security to the relevant English Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the English Guarantor’s creditors; and/or - take other action that is detrimental to the holders of the Notes. The Issuer and the Guarantors cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English Guarantor’s insolvency (as described further below) is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Onset of Insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (i) the court application for an administration order is issued, or (ii) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (iii) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out more particularly below). A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges includes (among others): - a party who is (i) a director of the company; (ii) a shadow director; (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (iv) an associate of the relevant company; ----- - a party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual; (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual or (v) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; - a party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company; and - a company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same person by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and security interests: _Transaction at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator (or its assignee) or administrator (or its assignee) of a company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by the company (or give other relief) on the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee or security must be granted within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended). A court will not generally make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees, although there is protection for a third party which benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or assignee of the claim) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a “connected person” (as defined in the English Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption the company was unable to pay its debts and the connected person must demonstrate the company was not unable to pay its debts in such proceedings. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator (or its assignee) or administrator (or its assignee) of a company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by such company (or give other relief) on the grounds that such a security interest or guarantee constituted a preference. The grant of a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing an existing creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the grant of the security interest or guarantee must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the English Insolvency Act) if the beneficiary of the security interest or the guarantee is not a connected person, or two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. A court will not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce the “better position” for that person. Case law suggests that there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better position. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees). There is protection for a third party which benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith for value. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or assignee of the claim) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that ----- the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such desire. _Transaction Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim, which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no statutory time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time, or as a result of, the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. However, such an order: (i) cannot prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances; and (ii) cannot require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate Credit Transaction_ An administrator (or its assignee) or a liquidator (or its assignee) can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English company in the period up to three years before the day on which that company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. _Grant of Floating Charge_ Under English insolvency law, if a company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting a floating charge then such floating charge can be avoided on the action of a liquidator or administrator if it was granted in the period of one year ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 245 of the English Insolvency Act) (or two years in the case of a floating charge in favor of a connected person). The floating charge will, however, be validated to the extent of the value of the consideration provided for the creation of the charge in the form of money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge plus interest payable on such amounts. Where the floating charge is granted to a “connected person” the prerequisite to challenge that the company is unable to pay its debts does not apply. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. _Onerous Property_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator (but not an administrator or administrative receiver) of a company may also, by giving a prescribed notice, disclaim any “onerous property” (being property which is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act). The disclaimer determines the rights, interests and liabilities of the company in the relevant property. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up. _Account Banks’ Right to Set-off_ With respect to English law governed charges over cash deposits (each an “Account Charge”) granted by a chargor over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may have reserved their right at any time (whether prior to or upon a crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangement with that chargor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a ----- floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant chargor), whether the Account Bank will continue to be entitled to exercise its netting and set-off rights is more complex .",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective obligor’s memorandum and articles of association (or equivalent constitutional documents). To the extent these do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the Note Guarantee and the subsequent Collateral can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Guarantor by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote success of the relevant obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Under the English company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including where such security is not governed by English law) granted by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales (together with prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after 6 April 2013, such security, if not registered within the 21 day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and a creditor of the applicable chargor. Further, failure to register also means that the debt which was intended to be secured is deemed to have become immediately payable. In the event where the relevant security document is not registered, a chargor incorporated in England and Wales may be required to enter into a new security document and register that with Companies House within 21 days of its creation. Alternatively it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify the position and allow the charge to be registered after the 21 day period has expired. This application can be made by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration of the security. Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although they may still need to be registered with the applicable asset registry). Guarantees and security granted by a guarantor or security provider incorporated in England and Wales as a public company are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

In practice this means that the company must either be a company incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 or one which has “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. In practice, the “sufficient connection” test has been found to be satisfied by the English courts where, among other things, the company has assets situated in England, the company’s centre of main interests is in England, the company’s finance documents are governed by English law or have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. The law in this area is being closely considered by the English courts and the fact that the “sufficient connection” test has been found to be satisfied in such cases previously does not necessarily mean that this will be satisfied in all such cases as each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise or arrangement can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more in value of those creditors present and voting at the creditors’ meeting of each class vote in favor of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable.

The CIGA contains a number of temporary measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of which will have retrospective effect, and introduces permanent reforms to the English insolvency regime. The CIGA affects the foregoing analysis and that analysis should be read in the context of the additional considerations outlined below. _Moratorium_ The CIGA inserts a new Part A1 in the English Insolvency Act which provides for a new, free-standing moratorium for certain companies, which is intended to provide a company in financial distress with breathing space in which to explore its rescue and restructuring options free from creditor enforcement action. Where a ----- company is an English company that is not subject to a winding-up petition, the directors of the company can obtain a moratorium by filing relevant documents with the court. Where an overseas company (or an English company that is subject to a winding-up petition) wishes to obtain a moratorium, it must make an application to the court. The application must contain a statement by the directors that in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts as they fall due. The court will only grant a moratorium where it is satisfied that the moratorium would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than the winding-up of the company without first being subject to a moratorium and (in the case of an overseas company) if there is a “sufficient connection” with the UK. The moratorium will be overseen by an insolvency practitioner acting as a “monitor” although the directors will remain in charge of running the business on a day-to-day basis. The effect of the moratorium will be to provide the company with a “payment holiday” in respect of its “pre-moratorium debts.” In other words, the company will not be obliged to pay those debts during the moratorium. A “pre-moratorium debt” is any debt or other liability of the company that has fallen due prior to the commencement of the moratorium or which becomes due during the moratorium but under an obligation incurred by the company prior to the commencement of the moratorium. A “moratorium debt” is any debt or other liability that the company becomes subject to during the moratorium (other than by reason of an obligation entered into prior to the moratorium) or to which the company may become subject after the end of the moratorium because of an obligation incurred during the moratorium. Certain pre-moratorium debts will be excluded from the operation of the moratorium regime, in so far as they consist of amounts payable in respect of (a) the monitor’s remuneration or expenses; (b) goods or services supplied during the moratorium (and which would otherwise be pre-moratorium debts because the supply contract was entered into pre-moratorium); (c) rent in respect of a period during the moratorium (under leases entered into pre-moratorium); (d) wages or salary arising under a contract of employment, regardless of when those wages or salary fall due; (e) redundancy payments, regardless of when those payments fall due; or (f) debts or other liabilities arising under a contract or other instrument involving financial services. These include (among others) financial contracts (loans, financial leases, guarantees or commitments, commodities contracts, securities contracts), derivatives and spot contracts, capital market arrangements and market contracts. The company is expected to keep making payment on the pre-moratorium debts listed in paragraphs (a) to (f) above for the duration of the moratorium. If those payments are not made, the monitor is required to bring the moratorium to an end. In relation to the commencement of English insolvency proceedings, the moratorium will prevent (a) the presentation of a winding-up petition and the making of a winding-up order by the court (except for petitions made by directors or certain public interest petitions); (b) the passing of a resolution for the voluntary winding-up of the company unless recommended by the directors; (c) the making of a winding-up order, except on petition by the directors; and (d) the appointment of an administrator, the appointment of an administrative receiver, or the application for an administration order (except if made by the directors). In relation to enforcement rights and legal proceedings, the moratorium will prevent (a) forfeiture of a lease by peaceable re-entry of business premises by a landlord; (b) the enforcement of security over the company’s property except where security constitutes a collateral security charge or financial collateral or security has been granted during the moratorium with the monitor’s consent; (c) the repossession of goods under a hire-purchase agreement; (d) the commencement or continuation of legal process against the company and its property (with limited exceptions); and (e) the crystallisation of a floating charge or any imposition of a restriction on disposal of a floating charge asset. Any provision of a document which provides for the appointment of a receiver on the commencement of a moratorium or anything done with a view to commencing the moratorium will also be void. This substantially mirrors the moratorium currently available in an administration of a company (see “— _Administration and Administrative Receivership” above), except in relation to the crystallisation of floating_ charges and the invalidation of provisions relating to the appointment of a receiver. The court may give permission to creditors to take certain steps above, provided an application for permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday. The moratorium will be for an initial period of 20 business days (beginning with the business day after it comes into force) with the possibility of extension by a further 20 business days by filing certain documents with the court (at any time after the 15th business day of the initial period). This one-time extension can be done by the directors without the consent of the creditors. There are a number of additional possibilities for extension of the moratorium, including extension of the moratorium with the consent of the creditors for a maximum period of up to 12 months from its commencement, extension with the consent of the court for an unlimited period and extension in connection with the implementation of a company voluntary arrangement, scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan. ----- The following companies are excluded from the moratorium regime: any company that is or has been subject to an insolvency procedure or moratorium in the preceding 12 months, any insurance company, bank, electronic money institution, investment bank or investment firm, companies that are party to market contracts/market charges, participants in a designated system, payment institutions, operators of payment systems, recognized investment exchanges, securitisation companies, parties to capital market arrangements (involving debt of at least £10 million), public private partnership project companies and certain overseas companies. As such, an English Guarantor may be excluded from the operation of the moratorium regime. _Restructuring plan_ The CIGA inserts a new Part 26A in the Companies Act 2006 which provides for a new restructuring plan procedure which is intended broadly to follow the process for a scheme of arrangement. A company can propose a restructuring plan to its creditors and/or members. Creditors and members will be divided into classes based on the similarity or otherwise of their rights prior to the restructuring plan and following implementation of the plan. The court must approve the class formation and the convening of restructuring plan meetings. Each class will then vote on whether they accept the plan and provided that sufficient creditors/members approve the plan and the court considers it a proper exercise of its discretion to sanction the plan, then the plan will be binding on all creditors and members regardless of whether they, individually or as a class, approved the plan. As with schemes of arrangement, under the CIGA the restructuring plan will be available not just to companies incorporated in the United Kingdom but to any company with a sufficient connection to the UK (see “—Schemes of Arrangement” above). There are two additional conditions a company must meet in order to use a restructuring plan: (a) the company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern (this is different to a scheme of arrangement, which can be proposed by a company in financial distress or a completely solvent company); and (b) a compromise or arrangement must be proposed between the company and its creditor or members (or any class of either) and the purpose of such compromise or arrangement must be to eliminate, reduce, prevent or mitigate the effect of any of the financial difficulties the company is facing. Before the court considers the sanction of a restructuring plan, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. Creditors or members of the company whose rights are affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in the meeting and vote on the plan but there is no need to include creditors or members whose rights are not affected. Furthermore, a court may exclude even a creditor or member whose rights are affected where it is satisfied that none of the members of that class has a genuine economic interest in the company. In respect of a consensual restructuring plan (i.e. one where each class votes in favour) to be capable of being sanctioned by the court, 75% in value of creditors or members present and voting (in person or by proxy) in each class must agree the compromise or arrangement. This is similar to the threshold in a scheme of arrangement but, unlike with a scheme of arrangement, there is no numerosity test requiring at least 50% by number of creditors voting in favour. In respect of a “cram-down” restructuring plan (i.e. a restructuring plan where there is a dissenting class of creditors or members), the court may still sanction a plan, provided that (a) the court is satisfied that none of the dissenting classes are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative” (referred to below); and (b) the plan has been agreed by a number representing 75% in value of a class of creditors or (as the case may be) of members, present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. Again, there is no numerosity requirement. The relevant alternative is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the compromise or arrangement were not sanctioned by the court. As with a scheme of arrangement, the restructuring plan then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the restructuring plan and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan. ----- Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings (but note “Prohibition on ipso facto termination provisions” below). _Prohibition on ipso facto termination provisions_ Under the CIGA, there is a prohibition on the exercise of contractual termination provisions in any contract for the supply of goods and services to a company, or ‘doing any other thing’ in respect of that contract, by reason of the company entering into an ‘insolvency procedure’. An ‘insolvency procedure’ includes where (a) a moratorium comes into force for the company under the new moratorium procedure; (b) the company enters administration; (c) an administrative receiver of the company is appointed; (d) a company voluntary arrangement takes effect in relation to the company; (e) the company goes into liquidation or a provisional liquidator is appointed; or (f) a convening order is made by the court in respect of a restructuring plan. The prohibition on the termination or variation of any contract for the supply of goods and services does not apply to schemes of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (although, as set out above, it does apply to restructuring plans). If the supplier had a right to terminate the contract or supply before the company became subject to an insolvency procedure but did not exercise that right, the supplier may not terminate for that reason during the insolvency period. Therefore, if a supplier does not exercise its rights in relation to a pre-insolvency default, it will temporarily lose that right once the insolvency procedure has commenced. Where the prohibitions on termination or variation are in effect, the supplier may only terminate the contract if (a) the relevant office-holder (i.e. the administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator or provisional liquidator) consents to the termination; (b) the company consents to the termination; or (c) the court is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship and grants permission for the termination of the contract. Certain entities are excluded from the prohibition on ipso facto termination provisions and will not be subject to them where they themselves are in distress or where they are a supplier to a business in distress. The excluded entities include deposit-taking and investment banks and insurance companies, so any contracts with these types of entity would be excluded. In addition, the prohibition only applies to contracts for the supply of goods and services. Financial contracts are excluded from these provisions and can continue to be terminated or varied on the grounds of insolvency. The list of what constitutes a ‘financial contract’ is extensive and includes loan agreements, financial leasing, swap agreements and derivatives and capital market arrangements. There is also a carve-out for any set-off or netting arrangement. _Temporary restrictions on winding-up petitions_ The CIGA provides for temporary restrictions on certain types of enforcement action in respect of unpaid debts. Specifically, the CIGA: (i) prevents any statutory demands issued against companies in the “relevant period” which is the period between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 (the “relevant period” having been extended by three months since the CIGA came into force), from being used as the basis of a winding-up petition at any point on or after April 27, 2020; and (ii) in respect of any winding-up petition presented in the period from April 27, 2020 to December 31, 2020, creates an additional condition that must be satisfied before a creditor can obtain a winding-up order against a company on the grounds that it is unable to pay its debts, namely that any creditor asking the court to make a winding-up order on those grounds must first demonstrate to the court that the company’s inability to pay its debts was not caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The time periods within which these provisions will apply may be further extended by statutory instrument (for a further period of up to three months). _CIGA order of priority following a moratorium_ The CIGA provides that, in any winding-up or administration that occurs within 12 weeks of a moratorium, any moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts are to be paid ahead of the claims of unsecured creditors, floating charge creditors and other expenses such as the liquidator’s or administrator’s fees. This does not include pre-moratorium debt that fell due during the relevant period by reason of an acceleration or early termination clause in a contract or other instrument involving financial services. In the limited circumstances of a winding-up or administration that occurs within 12 weeks of a moratorium, the usual order of priority referred to in “—Priority of Claims” above would be altered to give priority to those moratorium debts and priority premoratorium debts. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The position beyond December 31, 2020 is unknown at this time as it depends on, among other things, a trade deal being agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and whether or not such a deal includes a replacement for the current automatic recognition of United Kingdom insolvency procedures across the European Union and vice versa. Certain Guarantors are incorporated in England and Wales, maintain their respective registered offices in and conduct their businesses and the administration of their interests on a regular basis in and from England and Wales (“English Guarantors” and each an “English Guarantor”). On the basis of these factors, an English court may conclude that the English Guarantors have their “centre of main interests,” within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation, in England and therefore insolvency proceedings in England constituting “main insolvency proceedings” under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation may be commenced in respect of an English Guarantor in England & Wales. In such a case, English law would apply to those proceedings and the effects of those proceedings must be recognized by Member States across the European Union (except Denmark). Any insolvency proceedings of an English Guarantor would therefore likely, but not necessarily, proceed under and be governed by English insolvency laws. The presumption of the company’s centre of main interests being at the place of its registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other EU Member State. Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings may be commenced against a company in other Member States of the European Union (except Denmark) even if the centre of main interests is in England, provided that the company has an establishment in that other Member State. The effects of these proceedings would be restricted to the assets of the relevant company situated in that Member State. Further, the EU Insolvency Regulation would not affect the jurisdiction of courts outside the European Union (or the courts in Denmark) to open insolvency proceedings in respect of an English Guarantor in accordance with their local insolvency laws. The Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030), which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency in Great Britain, provide that foreign (i.e. non English) insolvency proceedings may be recognised in England where a company has its centre of main interests or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. In case of any conflict, the EU Insolvency Regulation will prevail over the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006. ----- Accordingly, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced in respect of the English Guarantors or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of different jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other including in (but not limited to) the areas of the rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, the priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain postpetition interest and the duration of proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdictions’ laws should apply or would adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Note Guarantees and/or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. English insolvency law is different from the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar and it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings with respect to an English Guarantor. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company, its directors or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company, the directors of that company, or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation) (see “—Temporary restrictions on winding-up petitions” below regarding certain temporary restrictions in respect of winding-up petitions). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes (in the case of an administration commenced by a holder of a “qualifying floating charge,” the holder needs to show that the relevant charge has become enforceable in accordance with its terms). Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “English Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (i.e., unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (i.e., the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, it fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). Certain obligations under the Notes are secured by English law-governed security interests. Therefore, English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of those security interests. Certain obligations under the Notes are governed by English law-governed guarantees, and therefore English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of those Guarantees. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the security interests and/or guarantees that are governed by English law. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and/or the security interests relating to the Notes and/or the guarantees relating to the Notes, and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English company.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Simon Holdco Limited is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of Simon Holdco Limited, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: “désastre” and creditors’ winding up. The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of “désastre,” title and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With effect from the date of declaration, subject to what is set out below, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt but may prove in the désastre. With effect from the date of declaration, a secured party may, however, without the consent of the Viscount and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the balance of the debt. Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding-up of an insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the winding up, no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company except with the leave of court. The shareholders must give creditors 14 days’ notice of the meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up. After the commencement of the creditors’ winding up, a secured party may, however, without the sanction of a liquidator and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, the secured party has no other remedy against the company without leave of the court. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved (although the powers of the liquidator shall, subject to the sanction of the court or the creditors (or a validly appointed committee of the creditors), be limited to such powers as may be required for the company’s beneficial winding-up). The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its winding up if (inter alia) three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

If the requisite majority of creditors or shareholders (or of the relevant class of either of them) agree to the Scheme and, following such agreement, the court sanctions the Scheme, the Scheme is binding on all creditors or shareholders (or on the relevant class of either of them) and on the company (or any liquidator and contributories of the company if the company is being wound up). -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognize the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets. However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey court may assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Jersey court thinks fit. These prescribed jurisdictions include the United Kingdom. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey. If the request comes from a prescribed country but not by a court-made request or from a non-prescribed country, then common law and principles of comity will be considered by the Royal Court by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are afoot in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. If the requesting country adheres to principles of territoriality, as opposed to universality, and, for instance, ring-fences assets for local creditors, full cooperation is highly unlikely. If, however, the jurisdiction applies similar fundamental principles to those applied in Jersey, the Royal Court’s approach is more likely to be similar to the position where prescribed countries are involved. In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. It would also be wrong to assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Union for the purposes of implementation of its directions.

Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey law. The shares of the Issuer and Garfunkelux PBA S.à r.l. in Simon Holdco Limited will be secured pursuant to Jersey law governed security interest agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over intangible movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition a secured party may take certain ancillary actions including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement to the extent not in conflict with the 2012 Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The power of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying the event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way of sale or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days prior written notice. Importantly, the grantor may agree in writing to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to include such a waiver in the security agreement. The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give at least 14 days prior written notice to: (i) any person who 21 days before the sale or appropriation has a registered security interest in the collateral; and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral and has, not less than 21 days before the sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest, unless, in each case, the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are specific carveouts from the obligation to give notice of sale. On exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, ----- the secured party must: (i) take all commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral, as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any agreement for or in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is owed to the grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party was required to give notice of sale or appropriation (whether or not they have agreed in writing to waive the notice requirements). If, in exercising its powers of enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give certain persons (being the grantor (subject to it having waived this requirement), any person with a registered subordinate security interest and certain persons claiming an interest in the collateral) a written statement of account setting out certain information in relation to that appropriation or sale. If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of appropriation or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the secured party, the secured party shall pay the amount of any resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in due order of priority, to any person who has a subordinate security interest in the collateral and has registered a financing statement over that security interest (where the registration remained effective immediately before the appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than the grantor) who has given the secured party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in respect of which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the relevant debtor grantor.

The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor operates his business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt of the petition for bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive information as to whether and when a debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (debtor’s own petition). The bankruptcy court does not provide information on a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy. A creditor cannot demand that the debtor be declared bankrupt if the creditor’s claim is secured by adequate security. In this context, adequate security means a security right expected to provide full coverage for the creditor. If the security is avoidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been performed, the creditor does not have adequate security. The creditor is not required to have a basis of execution for his claim, e.g. a judgment in a civil case, a settlement in court or a signed debt instrument or mortgage. Further, the creditor’s claim does not have to be due for payment to form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. However, the creditor must have a legal interest in the debtor’s estate being administered in bankruptcy. As a result, not all claims that have not become due for payment may form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. Depending on the circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in force or a repayment arrangement being observed by the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being rejected. The requirement for legal interest also means that in general the bankruptcy court will reject a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy if it is clear in advance that he will not receive any dividend in case of bankruptcy. It should be noted, however, that if there is probable cause to believe that the debtor has made avoidable transactions, the creditor may have the required legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have substantial assets. In that case, the creditor must be able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with some degree of certainty. A creditor having filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor will be liable to pay damages if the debtor suffers a loss or to pay compensation for injury to the debtor’s reputation if the bankruptcy conditions, e.g. the insolvency requirement, are not fulfilled or if the claim does not exist. ----- The petitioner must grant security for the expenses relating to the administration of the estate. In practice, the bankruptcy court demands security in the amount of DKK 30,000.

Consequently, the trustee must not be the debtor’s related party or depending on the debtor, and there must not be any doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is prevented from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification rules.

Transactions favoring creditors without observing the ranking of creditors are for example payment by unusual means of payment, payments before due date, payments having deteriorated the debtor’s ability to pay decisively or the provision of security for pre-existing, unsecured debts. The avoidance rule on security for pre-existing debts and the general avoidance rule applicable to various transactions are described below. Any security interest which has not been granted prior to, or simultaneously with, the debt obligations which it secures and which is not perfected without undue delay after the creation of such debt obligations will generally be subject to a three months hardening period, if insolvency proceedings are commenced against the provider of the security during the three month period starting from the latter of the date of the relevant act of perfection and the creation of the security interest. The timing requirements in respect of granting of security and perfection are interpreted very strictly under Danish law and “undue delay” in practice means as soon as practically possible. Danish law operates with a general avoidance rule, which stipulates that a transaction which unduly (improperly) favors a creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the company’s assets are prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the company’s debt is increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the company was, or because of the transaction became insolvent, and the favored party knew or ought to have known about the company’s insolvency and the circumstances that made the transaction improper. Improper behavior is normally related to a breach of the purpose of insolvency proceedings, which typically is the situation where a creditor should have realized that a given transaction would deprive the other creditors of their right to fulfilment of their claims. The usual hardening period is three months prior to the filing date, which is extended to up to 24 months for transactions with parties closely related to the company. The general avoidance rule (as described above) provides for an unlimited avoidance period with respect to improper transactions, only provided that the insolvency existing at the time of the improper transaction caused the later bankruptcy.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The Danish Capital Markets Act allows representatives to hold security on behalf of noteholders and the Security Agent will be appointed as representative pursuant to the Danish Capital Markets Act and, in accordance therewith, should be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority to ensure effective representation in case guarantees or security are granted by or over Danish companies. The collateral governed by Danish law will be perfected in favor of the Security Agent and some of the collateral may only be perfected after the occurrence of certain events of default. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may not be able to enforce its rights in the collateral against third parties, including a bankruptcy administrator and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. Moreover, if perfection occurs only after the occurrence of certain events of default it will entail a hardening period. A Danish court may find that a security interest in dividend rights and voting rights granted pursuant to a share pledge agreement has not been perfected until the parties secured by the share pledge have given notice to the relevant company that the voting rights and dividend rights pledged under the share pledge agreement may be exercised only by the secured parties or a security agent acting on their behalf. Upon perfection, the security interest in dividend rights and voting rights may be deemed to be security for pre-existing debt and, thus, as regards those rights be subject to a three months’ hardening period following perfection. Under Danish law, perfection of assignments of receivables requires (i) notice of assignment to the relevant debtor of the receivables and (ii) effective control over the cash flows from the receivables. If both of these requirements are not met (e.g., due to the assignor being permitted to receive payments under assigned receivables until an event of default), such assignment would be subject to avoidance as further described above from the time perfection is obtained. Under Danish law, the ranking of security rights is determined by the date on which the relevant act of perfection has been taken, and if a security interest created later in time over that same collateral, but in respect of which the act of perfection is completed prior to perfection of the pre-existing security interest then the security interest created later will have priority.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The first, company reorganization (Fi. _yrityssaneeraus), has the objective of investigating whether the business has a reasonable chance to continue and,_ if so, to rehabilitate the company’s viable business, ensure its continued viability and make arrangements with creditors. The second, bankruptcy (Fi. konkurssi), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a debtor to its creditors. _Company Reorganization_ If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is probable that a company reorganization will remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than for a short period, an application for company reorganization can be made to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors in accordance with the Finnish Company Reorganization Act (47/1993, as amended, Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta) (the “Company Reorganization Act”). Further, the initiation of company reorganization proceedings is possible—in theory, irrespective of the company’s solvency situation—when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company reorganization. If there are no specific legal barriers to company reorganization and, consequently, the court approves the application and opens company reorganization proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint an administrator (Fi. _selvittäjä). The board of directors and the managing director continue to act on behalf of the company during the_ reorganization proceedings. The reorganization administrator is entitled to review the company’s books and business documents, obtain any information on the company’s business activities, as well as to participate in meetings of the debtor’s corporate bodies. All existing claims against the company are suspended as of the commencement of the company reorganization. The suspension as a main rule prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the debts that have fallen due before the commencement of the reorganization program (although debts arising after the filing of the company reorganization application can be repaid and enforced) and the seizure of assets. The suspensions are in force until the company reorganization program has been confirmed by the district court or the proceedings have been dismissed. Creditors with equal ranking have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts within the company reorganization program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Company Reorganization Act, the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the company reorganization program: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second; (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reduce the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The company reorganization program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt. Consequently, the company reorganization procedure could result in holders of the notes receiving a right to recover considerably less than they would otherwise be entitled to recover under the guarantee granted by the Finnish Guarantor. Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, insofar as the value of the security at the commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority, i.e. the amount of the creditor’s claim exceeding the value of the security does not qualify as secured debt but, instead, will constitute unsecured debt and may, thus be subject to the measures described above. The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs second; or (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security. Payments on a secured debt shall be determined so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed one-half of the original credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, a court will take into consideration the length of the ----- remaining credit period, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs. _Bankruptcy_ A debtor or its qualifying creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a bankruptcy court of competent jurisdiction when the debtor has failed to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary. If the application is approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) of the bankruptcy estate (Fi. pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by the court. A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and use the proceeds received therefrom in payment of the creditors’ claims. In order to achieve the objective of bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors. As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a “claim letter”), by delivering it to the estate administrator no later than the deadline set by the estate administrator. If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, a value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a creditor with a secured claim and a creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor. Creditors have an equal right to a payment from the funds of the bankruptcy estate in the proportion of the amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, creditors of the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, creditors with claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into and any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law have precedence over all other creditors to receive their claims. Further, according to the Finnish Act on Ranking of Claims (1578/1992, as amended, _Laki velkojien maksunsaantijärjestyksestä), the following creditors have precedence over unsecured creditors to receive their claims: (i) secured creditors and holders of retention rights have priority to the proceeds, including interest accrued during a period of up to three years prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings, and relating to the relevant asset; (ii) creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of company reorganization proceedings; and (iii) creditors with claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive prior to other claims a disbursement of 50% of the net proceeds of the mortgaged assets (after the claims of creditors with a better priority position have been satisfied). The rights of the above-mentioned preferential creditors may adversely affect the interests of holders of the notes. Bankruptcy of a Finnish Guarantor could result in holders of the notes recovering less than they would have otherwise been entitled to recover under the guarantee granted by such Finnish Guarantor. Finnish law prescribes claims that are to be settled lastly. In practice, the most significant of such claims are the interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the bankruptcy, and certain bonds and loans which are under their terms subordinated to the claims of all other creditors of the debtor. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds. However, secured creditors that are secured pursuant to a fixed charge over movable or immovable property may exercise their right to enforce such collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale for a maximum of two months.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

According to the Company Reorganization Act and the Finnish Enforcement Code (705/2007, as amended, _Ulosottokaari), the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied in company reorganization and enforcement proceedings. The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator in the company reorganization and certain creditors may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor’s counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. In bankruptcy, this ----- period to file an action is one year from the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three months from the moment that the bankruptcy estate has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. In the case of a company reorganization program, the administrator must file an action within six months from the commencement of the reorganization proceedings or within three months from the moment that the administrator has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of other creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty of the transaction knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction and such persons are assumed to have had knowledge of the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii) the granting of security. Payment received by a creditor through enforcement effected by the relevant authority later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit. A gift or a transaction considered to be a gift may be recovered under Section 6 of the Recovery Act if it has been concluded within one year prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority. The aforesaid time limit is extended to three years if the parties are related persons (as defined in the Recovery Act) and the debtor was, at the time of the gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, or partly due to the transaction became, over-indebted. A contract may be considered to have characteristics of a gift if the benefit incurred by one party is substantially disproportionate to the value of the contract. Some Finnish legal scholars have supported the view that a guarantee or third party security could be recovered in accordance with the provisions regulating recovery of a gift but there is no clear consensus on this matter. When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the bankruptcy estate or the debtor. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that had been paid for the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable property. ----- Accordingly, the validity of the guarantee in respect of the Notes or any payment made thereunder may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. If the granting of a guarantee or a payment thereunder is successfully challenged, then the granting of such guarantee could be nullified or the payment recovered. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of a guarantee granted by the Finnish Guarantor, and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to such guarantee could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

While the matter is not entirely clear under Finnish law, the view among some Finnish scholars seems to be that the financing of an acquisition of shares in a foreign direct or indirect holding company would fall outside the scope of the beforementioned prohibition provided that such foreign parent company is not a member of a group of companies controlled by a qualifying Finnish legal entity but the prohibition of financial assistance may well apply fully to all direct and indirect parent companies of a Finnish Guarantor, including foreign companies. Further, a company can only distribute its assets in the ways specified in the Finnish Companies Act. Other transactions that reduce the assets of the company or increase its liabilities without a sound business reason constitute unlawful distribution of assets. If a company undertakes a transaction with or for the benefit of a direct or indirect parent company or another related party on terms that deviate to the detriment of the company from arms’ length terms, then this may be construed as unlawful profit distribution. Granting of guarantees and security requires that the granting of guarantee/security is based on sound business reasons (corporate benefit). The business justification for granting the guarantee/security is assessed on a company-level and on a stand-alone basis, without regard to any group benefit (synergies and the like can be taken into account to the extent they create direct benefits, such as cost savings, to the company). In the context of the guarantee/security in respect of the Notes, the assessment of business justification should take into consideration also, among other things, other guarantees and security granted or to be granted by the Finnish Guarantor for the other financing arrangements of the Group. For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to include language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security granted by limited liability companies incorporated in Finland is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict with the relevant statutory limitations. In line with this practice, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant security documents and the Note Guarantee granted by a Finnish Guarantor will contain such limitation language and thus be so limited. By operation of such limitation, the beneficiaries of the guarantee agree to enforce the guarantee against any Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that Finnish Guarantor. The actual scope of the guarantee by the Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful profit distribution, as applied to the guarantee, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be effectively guaranteed. The terms of the security documents granted by the Finnish Guarantor limit enforcement in all material respects in the same manner and to the same extent as the abovementioned limitations in respect of the payment obligations under the Finnish Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The Revolving Credit Facility contains a substantially similar limitation, but due to the different uses of the proceeds of the financings, the actual application of the limitation may lead to a different outcome in relation to the Revolving Credit Facility than in relation to the Notes. In addition to the corporate benefit requirement and the financial assistance prohibition, the granting of the guarantee/security has to be within the limits of the company’s business purpose (as set out in its articles of association).",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in ----- possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event.

A pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale and a pledge of receivables either by selling the receivable or by the secured creditor collecting payment of the receivable. Typically collection of receivables directly from the debtors of the pledgor results in more expedient and profitable outcome than a sale of the receivables, both of which are forms of self-enforcement. In case the debtor does not pay the debts in the due time, the pledgee has the possibility to file a claim to the District Court in order to obtain a summary judgment, which can be used as grounds for official enforcement. The Finnish Commercial Code (3/1734, as amended, Kauppakaari) stipulates a default process in respect of an enforcement of pledge of movable assets.

The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets.

Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may, and often is, extended for several additional three-month-periods. An administrator is appointed by the court and supervises the day to day activities and safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required. However, if the debtor fails to comply with the restrictions it does not affect the validity of such actions. The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts with the debtor but the Reorganization Act contains specific rules that restrict termination of contracts due to breaches of contractual obligations that occurred prior to the instigation of the reorganization and, during the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that fell due prior to the order ----- without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such company has been delivered to the agent or with a Swedish law pledge over a loan which is documented by a negotiable debt instrument (Sw. löpande skuldebrev). The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (Sw. offentligt ackord), which means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public composition must meet certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors that are allowed to vote, in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set off rights or priority rights.

The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type. Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the secured party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event would therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security interests have been perfected. Such unperfected secured assets are vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider. Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the secured assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over an asset in connection with the disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at risk of impairing the validity of the security. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

If any of these limitations apply to the financial assistance, such financial assistance (in whole or in part) may be deemed invalid and the value of e.g. the underlying guarantee or security interest may be significantly reduced or fall away all together. Section 8-7 restricts a Norwegian company’s ability to grant financial assistance in favor of its (direct or indirect) parent company or any of its affiliates out of its distributable reserves unless such financial assistance falls within one or more of the exemptions listed in section 8-7 (3). These exemptions include, inter alia, financial assistance granted by a Norwegian company to (i) its Norwegian incorporated parent company or Norwegian incorporated group companies or (ii) to any other company who has decisive influence over the Norwegian company or subsidiaries of such company provided that such financial assistance serves the economic interest of the group of companies. Pursuant to section 8-10 (1) of the Norwegian Companies Act, a Norwegian company may, as a starting point, only provide financial assistance in connection with the acquisition of its own or its direct or indirect parent company’s shares out of its distributable reserves. As of 1 January 2020 the regulations were amended to permit financial assistance where the acquirer will form part of the company’s group following the acquisition (i.e. acquirer following the acquisition will have decisive influence over the Norwegian company (i.e. typically having, as a result of an agreement or by the ownership of shares or other ownership interests in the other company (directly or indirectly), (i) a majority of the voting rights in the company, or (ii) a right to elect or remove a majority of the membes of the board of directors of the company) subject to the following conditions: - the acquirer is domiciled in an EU/EEA-country; - the financial assistance is provided on commercial terms and principles and relate to fully paid-in shares; - the financial assistance is approved by the board of directors and shareholder meeting of the company before the financial assistance is provided; - the board makes an assessment of the creditworthiness of the beneficiary of the financial assistance; - the board prepares a report which inter alia include the background for the proposal, terms related thereto, the price to be paid for the shares, an assessment of the company’s interest in providing the financial assistance and the consequences as to the equity and liquidity of the company; - the board shall confirm that it is in the company’s interest to make the assistance and that the company will meet its legal requirements to sound equity and liquidity; and ----- - the report and the confirmation must be enclosed with the summons to the shareholder meeting referred to above and will be public and shall without undue delay be filed with the Norwegian Business Register before the financial assistance is provided.

Enforcement of a security interest created under Norwegian law may only take place in a manner authorized by Norwegian law. Norwegian law requires a statutory basis for establishing a security interest. The Norwegian Mortgages and Pledges Act (panteloven) (the “Pledge Act”) is the legal basis for most types of security which can be established pursuant to Norwegian law. It is a general condition for establishing a security interest that the assets to be pledged are transferable. The security will only be enforceable against third parties including the bankruptcy estate where the necessary perfection acts have been undertaken. The procedure for perfecting a security interest varies depending on the type of asset being subject to the security interest. Any security interest in respect of which legal protection has not been obtained without undue delay following the creation of the debt in respect of which such security interest was granted, will be held invalid in the event i) that a petition for the bankruptcy or debt negotiations in respect of the pledgor/assignor has been filed within three months of the obtaining of legal protection for such security and the pledgor/assignor is declared bankrupt or debt negotiations are initiated as a consequence of such petition, or ii) that it is found that the obtaining of legally protected security interest at the time of such obtaining represents an act of ill faith on the part of the relevant creditor in relation to the other creditors of the pledgor/assignor. Moreover, if the relevant security interest is not perfected, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce such holder’s rights in the relevant asset in competition with third parties, including an administrator in the bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same assets. Under Norwegian law, the ranking of security interests is determined by the date on which they were perfected. A security interest created on a later date over the same assets, but which was perfected at an earlier time, generally has priority. As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement situation and agreements on enforcement cannot be validly entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts or the Norwegian enforcement authorities. For specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of the chargor. The concept of a security trustee, as understood under U.S. law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In Norway a security trustee would be considered to be acting as a security agent. In practice in Norway, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor the security agent may be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond trustee for an undisclosed number of ----- noteholders can, based on the provisions in the relevant bond agreement or indenture, take legal action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the holders of the Notes without having to disclose the identity of the holders of the Notes. However, the relevant Norwegian court would have to examine the relevant indenture together with the other relevant agreements relating to the Notes and this Offering to determine whether the trustee would be able to act in such capacity.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Such mortgage rights are to secure necessary costs related to the bankruptcy proceedings and to secure loans granted to finance debt reorganization proceedings. Under Norwegian law such mortgage rights are applicable also in respect of cross collateral arrangements, and such mortgage rights may increase accordingly as a result thereof. Such statory lien is not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act (Lov om finansiell sikkehetsstillese) (the “Financial Collateal Act”), cf. the Norwegian Pledge Act Section 6-4 (9). The security granted by a Norwegian company might be subject to defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections which could adversely affect the value of the security and the ability to enforce or realize the security. Furthermore, the ranking of security interest can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the assets over which a Norwegian company grants a security are, or will be, free and clear from third-party prior ranking security rights or other interests arising by operation of law. According to the Norwegian Enforcement Act (tvangsfullbyrdelsesloven), enforcement of claims is contingent upon the existence of an enforcement basis (tvangsgrunnlag), which may require a relevant party to obtain a court judgment, arbitral award or similar decisions. Obtaining such awards may be a lengthy and costly process. A Norwegian court may reject a mere technical or minor default under an agreement without a payment default as a proper basis for execution, unless the relevant event of default is held to be material. Enforcement of rights under Norwegian law may furthermore be or become limited by prescription, lapse of time or barred under the Norwegian Limitation Act, and claims under a document may become subject to set-off, counterclaim or other defences. Furthermore, the Financial Agreements Act (finansavtaleloven) include certain provisions applicable to a company incorporated in Norway when granting security and guarantees for the debt of other parties and, inter alia, requires that a maximum amount is specified in respect of each security interest and guarantee. A company’s ability to grant security may also be restricted by the relevant company’s constitutional documents and, in the case of a share pledge, the articles of association of the company’s whose shares are subject to security.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The company shall be deemed insolvent if the value of the company’s debt exceeds the value of the company’s assets and the company is unable to pay its debts when due (unless the company’s inability to pay its debts is temporary), cf. the above statements on “Insolvency.” Once the company is declared bankrupt, the court shall appoint a bankruptcy administrator (bostyrer). The bankruptcy administrator shall manage the bankruptcy estate in the manner most beneficial to both secured and unsecured creditors and take all measures to ensure a swift and advantageous realization of the assets of the company. Hence, the primary objective of the bankruptcy administrator will, under Norwegian law, be to realize all assets, distribute the proceeds to the creditors and dissolve and de-register the company. The company will cease to exist after bankruptcy has been declared. The bankruptcy administrator normally sends out an information letter to all known creditors at an early stage of the bankruptcy proceedings. Further, a public announcement is made in a local newspaper commonly read in the community where the debtor is located and on the Brønnøysund Register Centre’s website. An initial meeting of creditors is held in the bankruptcy court, normally within four weeks of the opening of bankruptcy proceedings. Further court meetings are usually not held and must be requested by the court or the bankruptcy administrator or a member of the creditors’ committee. Creditors can only request such meetings when they represent at least one-fifth of the creditors, both with regard to number and amount. As a general rule, the bankruptcy estate seizes all assets and rights of the company at the time the company was declared bankrupt, and all assets acquired thereafter, as well as any assets that can be recovered by the bankruptcy administration. The rights of the bankruptcy estate include the right to sell the assets, continue the business, enter into or start legal proceedings to obtain assets, reverse transactions (under specific circumstances) and enter into various types of agreements. Norwegian bankruptcy legislation has rules whereby certain transactions by the debtor made within a certain period of time prior to the opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be avoided/reversed. A distinction can be made between objective and subjective rules. Objective rules apply to transactions regardless of whether the company was insolvent at the time of the transaction and whether the company or the counterparty can be reproached for having entered into the transaction. In the main, only transactions entered into within a three-month period prior to the bankruptcy proceeding can be set aside, according to an objective rule. The objective rules apply to, for example, gift transactions, security for older debt and extraordinary payments (such as payments before due time, payments made by unusual means or payments that have considerably weakened the company’s ability to meet payments). Pursuant to the subjective rule a transaction which improperly (i) gives preference to one creditor at the expense of the others, (ii) prevents the debtor's assets from being used to cover the creditor's claims, or (iii) increases the debtor's liabilities in a manner which is detrimental to the creditors, may be avoided if the debtor's financial situation was weak or became seriously weakened by the transaction. A condition to the application of the rule is that the other party knew or should have known of the debtor's financial difficulties and the circumstances which rendered the transaction improper. The subjective rule applies to transactions made 10 years prior to the bankruptcy. Pursuant to the Temporary Reorganization Act, debtors that are facing or that in the near future will face serious economic problems may petition to the court for the commencement of debt negotiation proceedings. The goal of such proceedings is to enable the debtor to restructure its debts, following either unanimous creditor consent (“Unanimous Reorganization”) or consent from a requisite majority of the creditors affected (a “Non**unanimous Reorganization”). The commencement of reorganization proceedings results in the appointment of a reorganization official and a creditor committee that together form a reorganization committee. The reorganization committee is charged with supervising the debtor during the proceedings and assisting it with putting forward a reorganization proposal to its creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the enforcement rights of creditors are suspended during the proceedings. A debtor in reorganization proceedings has certain possibilities for securing new financing with security interests over its assets that rank ahead of existing security interests. First, the debtor may, subject to the consent of the reorganization committee, offer superpriority security interests over its plant and machinery, inventory and trade receivables to lenders financing the continuation of the debtor’s business activities during the proceedings and the associated expenses. There is no numerical limit to the sums that may be secured on a superpriority basis, but existing secured creditors may petition for the reversal of the reorganization committee’s ----- consent if the superpriority security interest has a material adverse effect on their position. Second, loans obtained to finance the continuation of the debtor’s business activities during the proceedings and the associated expenses enjoy a statutory first lien over all of the debtor’s assets. This lien is subject to the same limitations as the bankruptcy estate’s statutory lien described above. Assets (including receivables) acquired by a debtor while under reorganisation proceedings will as a starting point fall outside the scope of existing security interests. A Unanimous Reorganization may in principle consist of any amendments to the debtor’s debts. The adoption of a reorganization proposal as Unanimous Reorganization generally requires the consent of all creditors concerned. However, in the event that no creditors have rejected the proposal following the expiry of a voting period set by the reorganization official, the proposal will be deemed approved if it has been approved by creditors representing three-fourths of the claims affected. The following measures may be imposed as part of a Non-unanimous Reorganization: - a rescheduling of the debtor’s payment obligations; - a reduction of the debtor’s debts; - the conversion of debt to equity capital; - the transfer of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets to a purchaser; - the transfer and winding up of all the debtor’s business and assets with the debtor being released from debts exceeding the proceeds of the winding up; and/or - a combination of the above measures. A Non-unanimous Reorganization cannot encroach upon the rights of non-consenting secured creditors, creditors that enjoy preferential priority in bankruptcy (except for certain tax claims) and creditors with set-off rights. However, secured claims may be encroached upon if and to the extent the reorganization committee deems that the claim exceeds the value of the secured assets. The adoption of a Non-unanimous Reorganization requires the approval of creditors representing a majority of the claims with voting rights. The claims with voting rights will generally be the claims that are affected by the proposal. Following the approval of a requisite majority, a Non-unanimous Reorganization must be sanctioned by the court. The court may, in addition to reviewing whether procedural requirements have been observed, review the fairness of the proposal. Such review will take into account whether individual creditors have been compensated to consent to the reorganization, the burden-sharing among the creditors and whether creditors are worse off than if the debtor was instead subject to bankruptcy proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

First priority claims consist of salary claims within certain time and amount limitations. Second priority claims consist of certain tax and VAT claims within certain time limitations. However, none of these claims has priority over secured creditors. Secured creditors are secured up to the value of the secured property. Exceeding claims are transferred to ordinary unsecured claims. The priority clauses simply state that first priority claims must be covered in full before any dividend is payable to second priority claims, and that second priority claims must be covered inn full before any dividend is payable to unsecured claims.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The business as a whole is cash generative before portfolio acquisitions and tax, generating cash of £222.1m in the six months to 30 June 2020 (six months ended 30 June 2019: £193.1m), with operating cash flow after portfolio acquisitions and tax being £94.5m (six months ended 30 June 2019: £7.3m). The Group continually monitors its cash flow requirements to ensure that enough cash is available to meet its commitments. Although management believe collections have generally shown good resilience since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during Q2 the Group experienced a reduction in back-book collections compared to the Estimated Remaining Collections (“ERC”) forecast at 31 December 2019. This reduction has been largely driven by management decisions to temporarily reduce outbound consumer contact activity and pause new legal collections in the UK region. Management resumed outbound customer contact activity in June and intends to resume new legal collections in the second half of 2020, with the objective of increasing the Group’s future collections. Management has additional available actions for cash outflow management which principally include a reduction in portfolio acquisitions together with cost mitigations, including placing staff in the DACH region on the German short time working scheme (Kurzarbeit), delaying a number of change projects and reducing other discretionary spend. In assessing whether the going concern basis is appropriate to adopt, the directors have undertaken a review of forecast cash flow models and scenarios for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. These scenarios have been subject to stress testing, and severe but plausible downside scenarios have been considered, taking into account both the Group’s performance since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the possibility of a second spike in infections in late-2020. They consider a range of cash flow reductions including smaller as well as double-digit reductions in collections across the UK, DACH and the Nordics.

Total goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Additionally, if there is evidence of an impairment trigger in any CGU, goodwill allocated to that CGU is also tested for impairment.

Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate discount rate. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rated basis in relation to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Acquired portfolio investments are held to collect contractual cash flows of payments of solely principal and interest, recognising them at amortised cost and in line with IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”). The effective interest rate (“EIR”) is the rate that exactly discounts the day one estimated future cash receipts of the acquired portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition, (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). These estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the estimated remaining life of the portfolios and range from 84 months to 120 months. Acquired portfolio investments are acquired at a deep discount and classified as purchased or originated credit impaired (“POCI”) in line with IFRS 9. As a result the estimated future cash flows, and hence EIR, reflect the expected lifetime credit losses within each portfolio. Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cash flows be deemed greater than previous estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period to derive future cash receipts. The difference in carrying value following an enhanced collection forecast is recognised in the net portfolio write up or write down line within income, with subsequent reversals also recorded in this line. This line represents the net impairment gains on portfolio investments. As part of the acquisition accounting around the purchase of Metis Bidco Limited by Simon Bidco Limited on 13 October 2015 the portfolio investments were uplifted to their fair value at the date of acquisition. The portfolio fair value release represents the unwinding of this fair value uplift. This uplift is being unwound in line with the standard profile of a gross ERC curve of these portfolios. _Service revenue_ Service revenue represents amounts receivable for tracing and debt collecting services (commissions and fees) provided to third party clients including collection lawyers, net of VAT where applicable. Performance obligations within service contracts are the collection of cash and hence these are satisfied when the Group collects on debt. Payment is due from clients shortly after cash is collected on their behalf. Revenue is recognised when performance obligations are satisfied. _Impairment of acquired portfolio investments_ Acquired portfolio investments are reviewed for indications of impairment in accordance with the IFRS 9 forward looking expected credit loss (“ECL”) model. As the Group’s portfolio investments are classified as POCI assets, lifetime ECL is included in the calculation of EIR. The estimation of ECL includes an assessment of forward-looking economic assumptions. Impairment represents changes to carrying values, discounted at the EIR, of the portfolio investments as a result of reassessments of the estimated future cash flows. These are recognised in net portfolio write up or write down in the SCI. The impairment adjustment is calculated by discounting regularly revised cash flow forecasts developed for each individual portfolio investment, at the initially set EIR.

Such assets or liabilities are initially recognised at cost, which at this point equates to fair value. They must be measured subsequently at fair value. The main assets and liabilities in the Group falling into this category are derivative financial instruments that do not fall under the scope of hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. _Loans and receivables_ Acquired portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value. The portfolios are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. The portfolio investment is analysed between current and non-current in the SFP. The current asset is determined using the expected cash flows arising in the next twelve months after the SFP date. The residual amount is classified as noncurrent. Portfolio investments include litigation costs which represent upfront fees paid during the litigation process, expected to be recoverable from the customer and added to the customer account balance to be recovered at a later date. _Loans and receivables (continued)_ Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as ‘Trade and other receivables’. Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables (including trade receivables) when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. The Group has forward flow agreements in place in relation to the future acquisition of portfolio investments. The fair value and subsequent amortised cost of portfolios acquired under these agreements are determined on the same basis as the Group’s other portfolio investments. _Impairment of financial assets_ Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each period end. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. _Financial liabilities and equity_ Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. _Financial liabilities_ All financial liabilities held by the Group are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, except for those measured at fair value through the SCI, e.g. derivative liabilities.

Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the SCI because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end. _Deferred tax_ Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each SFP date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the SFP date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the SCI, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.

Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods but may have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. This is the case if the contract gives the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This right to control is established if: - The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset; and - The Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. The identified asset should be physically distinct or be implicitly specified at the time the asset is made available. Even if the asset is specified, the Group does not have the right to use the asset if the supplier has the substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use. If the contract is for use of a portion of an asset that is not physically distinct it is not an identified asset unless it represents substantially all of the capacity of that asset. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received plus any initial direct costs and an estimate of restoration costs. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and includes fixed payments, variable lease payments linked to an index or rate and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. The lease payments are discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

The calculation of the EIR for each portfolio is based on the estimation of future cash flows, known as ERC’s. These ERCs are based upon historical collections data from other portfolios with similar features such as type and quantum of debt, or age. The calculation of the ERC for each portfolio investment is inherently judgemental as it involves the estimation of future cash flows based upon collections data from the individual debt owed. An uplift or reduction in expected future cash flows of 1% would increase or decrease the closing carrying value of portfolio investments at 30 June 2020 by £16.5m (31 December 2019: £16.6m). Actual cash flows are regularly compared to estimates to assess the accuracy of previous forecasts. Future collections may differ from those estimated at this point in time and if they do differ, an adjustment is recorded to the carrying value of the portfolio and is included as a net portfolio write up or write down within income. The ERC of the portfolio investments has been assessed at the period-end on a regional basis. Management have considered the observable information available in forming judgements for each region, noting that collections have remained resilient during the first half of 2020, albeit reducing in the second quarter across the Group, largely due to implemented management actions. Any regional underperformance is considered by management as a short-term deferral rather than loss. Consequently, management have adjusted their expectations of the timing of future collections, impacting the portfolio valuation in the short-term and resulting in the Group recognising a net portfolio write-down of £2.7m during the six months to June 2020 (six months to June 2019: net portfolio write-up of £86.2m). Despite management’s view that collections are resilient, there may be a further collections impact during the coming months which causes ERC’s to be re-evaluated during the remainder of 2020. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 continues to spread and may impact our ability to perform collection activities due to disruptions to the court system or other key operational activities.

As at 30 June 2020 management has determined that the economic impact of COVID-19 could be an indicator of impairment for goodwill and the Group have performed a goodwill impairment review, the result of which showed no impairment to the carrying value of the Group’s goodwill. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of the value in use requires an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from each CGU after a suitable discount rate has been applied to calculate present value. This inherently involves a number of judgements in that cash flow forecasts are prepared for periods that are beyond the normal requirement of management reporting, and the appropriate discount rate relevant to the business is an estimate. The Group’s significant estimate in the cash flow analysis underpinning the impairment review is the level of portfolio acquisitions that can be achieved over the forecast period within each CGU, based on the future profitability and funding profile of the Group.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to three aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the smallest groups of assets that individually generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash in flows from other assets or groups of assets. The CGUs identified are the UK, comprising of all subsidiary companies operated in the UK owned by Simon Bidco Limited, DACH, consisting of all subsidiary companies operated in DACH owned by Lowell Holding GmbH and Nordics, consisting of all subsidiary companies operated in the Nordic region owned by Lowell Nordics Oy. Foreign currency denominated goodwill is retranslated from local currencies to the Group’s presentational currency at each balance sheet date and gives rise to the currency translation effect shown above. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the level of portfolio acquisitions, discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to collections and direct costs during the forecast period. The Group uses cash flow expectations from the latest forecasts, prepared for the next four years and extrapolates these forecasts into perpetuity, using growth rates of 1.5% to 2.0%. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.

Under this agreement, the Garfunkelux Group managers entered into a nominee agreement with Garfunkelux Nominee S.à r.l. (“Nominee”), pursuant to which the Nominee is the registered shareholder of the shareholder instruments as nominee for the Garfunkelux Group managers and these managers are the beneficial owners of the shareholder instruments held by Nominee. The Garfunkelux Group managers subscribed for shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant. The Garfunkelux Group managers further agreed, in the same agreement, to sell back to Garfunkelux Invest S.à r.l., the main shareholder of Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., the shares owned in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. in the event they cease to be an employee and/or a corporate officer of the Group. The selling price of the shares is determined on the basis of a number of conditions including the service period and whether the Garfunkelux Group manager qualifies as a good leaver or a bad leaver. The sale price of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. owned by the Garfunkelux Group managers will be settled in cash. In the consolidated financial statements of the Group, this arrangement has been classified as equity settled transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with the Garfunkelux Group managers. However since amounts paid by the Garfunkelux Group managers for the subscription of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. are at fair value, the awards have no material fair value at grant date and therefore there is no expense recognised in the SCI for the year or previous year. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

This includes the risk of changes caused by market variables such as prices, type and timing of debt coming to the market, i.e. the cost of consumer debt portfolios. In bidding for consumer debt portfolios, the Group seeks to achieve a sufficient yield to cover both the cost of collection and overhead costs, thereby minimising the risk of not recovering the cost of these portfolios. The Group uses sophisticated pricing models along with extensive customer and market data to establish the profitability of portfolios coming to market. The Group monitors its pricing assumptions through Investment Committees (subsets of the Executive Committee). The Group manages the unpredictability of the market through a number of financing structures. The Group has in place €365m, £565m, €415m, €530m and SEK 1,280m of Senior Secured loan Notes, £230m of Senior loan Notes, and a €455m RCF facility. At 31 December 2018 the RCF facility was £14.0m drawn down (31 December 2017: £41m).

The risk from the concentration of debtor credit risk is limited due to the high number of individual customer balances and the relatively low value of each of the individual’s debts. The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios. All portfolios by their nature are impaired on acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections. Carrying values are impaired when and if the underlying performance does not meet initial expectations. The on-going risk is managed through utilising a comprehensive portfolio valuation model and building current expectations of recoverability from information on debt types and customers into pricing assumptions and models. An Investment Committee is in place which is attended by members of the Executive Committee as well as other key members from across the business. This committee is in place to scrutinise all aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational and compliance risk through to the financial assumptions and maximum bid price.

Pension obligations were calculated in accordance with the requirements set out in IAS 19. An interest rate of between 1.7% and 2.2% (2017: 1.5% and 2.0%), depending on the group of beneficiaries, was used for this purpose. The defined benefit obligation arising from the defined benefit plans was determined in accordance with IAS 19. The calculations took into account estimated increases in pensions and salaries as well as an employee turnover rate. Pension increases were estimated at 1.0% to 1.5% (2017: 1.0 to 1.5%), salary increases at 0.0% to 2.0% (2017: 0.0% to 2.0%), and the employee turnover rate in a range from 0.0% to 2.0% (2017: 0.0% to 2.0%). The employee turnover rate, in particular, depends on the age of the pension beneficiaries. Mortality and invalidity rates were measured for the German companies using the 2005 G Heubeck mortality tables. The pension plan for one of the former members of the Executive Board of Lowell Financial Services GmbH includes a retirement pension entitlement when the beneficiary reaches the age of 60. This retirement pension is equivalent to up to 75% of the average fixed salary over the five years immediately prior to retirement. The pension entitlement for two former employees of GFKL PayProtect GmbH comprises a retirement pension to be paid when the beneficiary reaches the age of 65. Following the transfer of employees from the ERGO Group, Sirius Inkasso GmbH recognised provisions for pensions for the first time in 2006. The pension entitlement comprises a lifelong retirement pension paid when the beneficiary retires from the service of the entity upon reaching the age of 65. A total of 13 employees at Sirius Inkasso GmbH have the benefit of this pension entitlement. Pension entitlements have also been granted to employees of Proceed Collection Services GmbH as a result of the transfer of 19 employees from Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG (now UniCredit Bank AG).

Under this agreement, the Garfunkelux Group managers entered into a nominee agreement with Garfunkelux Nominee S.à r.l. (“Nominee”), pursuant to which the Nominee is the registered shareholder of the shareholder instruments as nominee for the Garfunkelux Group managers and these managers are the beneficial owners of the shareholder instruments held by Nominee. The Garfunkelux Group managers subscribed for shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant. The Garfunkelux Group managers further agreed, in the same agreement, to sell back to Garfunkelux Invest S.à r.l., the main shareholder of Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., the shares owned in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. in the event they cease to be an employee and/or a corporate officer of the Group. The selling price of the shares is determined on the basis of a number of conditions including the service period and whether the Garfunkelux Group manager qualifies as good leaver or bad leaver. The sale price of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. owned by the Garfunkelux Group managers will be settled in cash. In the consolidated financial statements of the Group, this arrangement has been classified as equity settled transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with the Garfunkelux Group managers. However since amounts paid by the Garfunkelux Group managers for the subscription of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. are at fair value, the awards have no material fair value at grant date and therefore there is no expense recognised in the SCI for the year or previous year. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios. All portfolios by their nature are impaired on acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections. Carrying values are impaired when and if the underlying performance does not meet initial expectations. The on-going risk is managed through utilising a comprehensive portfolio valuation model and building current expectations of recoverability from historical information on debt types and customers into pricing assumptions and models. An investment committee is in place which is attended by members of the Executive Committee as well as other key members from across areas of the business.

A “paying” portfolio is determined at the point of acquisition based on the proportion of accounts within that portfolio that are set up on a payment plan.

Pension obligations were calculated in accordance with the requirements set out in IAS 19. An interest rate of between 1.5% and 2.0% (2016: 1.5% and 1.9%), depending on the group of beneficiaries, was used for this purpose. The defined benefit obligation arising from the defined benefit plans was determined in accordance with IAS 19. The calculations took into account estimated increases in pensions and salaries as well as an employee turnover rate. Pension increases were estimated at 1.0% to 1.5% (2016: 1.0 - 1.5%), salary increases at 2.0% (2016: 0.0% to 2.0%), and the employee turnover rate in a range from 0.0% to 2.0% (2016: 0.0% to 2.0%). The employee turnover rate, in particular, depends on the age of the pension beneficiaries. Mortality and invalidity rates were measured for the German companies using the 2005 G Heubeck mortality tables. The pension plan for one of the former members of the Executive Board of Lowell Financial Services GmbH includes a retirement pension entitlement when the beneficiary reaches the age of 60. This retirement pension is equivalent to up to 75% of the average fixed salary over the five years immediately prior to retirement. The pension entitlement for two former employees of GFKL PayProtect GmbH comprises a retirement pension to be paid when the beneficiary reaches the age of 65. Following the transfer of employees from the ERGO Group, Sirius Inkasso GmbH recognised provisions for pensions for the first time in 2006. The pension entitlement comprises a lifelong retirement pension paid when the beneficiary retires from the service of the entity upon reaching the age of 65. A total of 13 employees at Sirius Inkasso GmbH have the benefit of this pension entitlement. Pension entitlements have also been granted to employees of Proceed Collection Services GmbH as a result of the transfer of 19 employees from Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG (now UniCredit Bank AG).

For the Group, the fair value of the acquired portfolios is determined using a discounted cash flow model with unobservable inputs and are classified as level 3 measurements. The unobservable inputs in determining the fair value are the discount rate and service cost percentage which differ for portfolios that are not deemed as “paying” at the point of acquisition and those that are deemed as “paying”. A “paying” portfolio is determined at the point of acquisition based on the proportion of accounts within that portfolio that are set up on a payment plan. The discount rates have been determined from market information and benchmarking. The service cost percentage is the percentage used to discount the gross cash flows to net and is based on historical information on costs to collect. The Senior and the Senior Secured Notes are publicly traded instruments whose value can be obtained from public sources; as a result these are classified as level 1. The remaining financial assets and liabilities carried are assumed to have a fair value equal to their carrying value. The fair value of non-financial instruments have been considered and it was determined that the fair value is materially equal to their carrying value therefore no additional disclosure has been made. |Carrying amount 30 June 31 December 2020 2019 £000 £000 (Unaudited) Financial assets|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Fair value|Col7| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---| |||||31 December 2019 £000|30 June 2020 £000 (Unaudited)|31 December 2019 £000| |Cash and cash equivalents .........................................|||306,942|124,495|306,942|124,495| |Investments and receivables:||||||| |Portfolios investments ...............................................|||1,652,293|1,660,138|1,707,942|1,710,787| |Other financial assets ................................................|||73,863|61,493|73,863|61,493| |Total financial assets ...............................................|||2,033,098|1,846,126|2,088,747|1,896,775| |||||||| |Financial liabilities||||||| |Financial instruments measured at amortised cost:||||||| |Senior Secured Notes* ..............................................|||1,889,267|1,800,255|1,702,334|1,685,153| |Senior Notes* ............................................................|||200,103|200,103|170,124|194,429| |Borrowings – RCF ....................................................|||405,797|265,741|405,797|265,741| |Borrowings – Shareholder loan .................................|||436,019|388,079|436,019|388,079| |Borrowings – Securitisation loan|||234,058|194,160|234,058|194,160| |Other financial liabilities ...........................................|||223,505|209,264|223,505|209,267| |Total financial liabilities .........................................|||3,388,749|3,057,602|3,171,837|2,936,829| -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Brexit is one of the most significant economic events for the UK, and at the date of this report its effects are subject to unprecedented levels of uncertainty of outcomes, with the full range of possible effects unknown. We applied a standardised firm-wide approach in response to that uncertainty when assessing the Group’s future prospects and performance.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Other standards effective from 1 January 2019 do not have a material impact on the financial statements. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on balance sheet accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The only exemptions to this are short-term leases and leases of low value items. The Group has applied the modified retrospective approach with no restatement of comparative information required. At 1 January 2019, the Group recognised a right-of-use asset of £49.3m (disclosed as part of property, plant and equipment in the balance sheet), lease liabilities of £53.7m (included within other financial liabilities) and release of lease accruals of £4.4m. On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which were previously classified as ‘operating leases’ in accordance with IAS 17. The liabilities recognised were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate of 4.3%. The €455m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) is the Group’s primary working capital facility which is used to service the leases and is secured on the assets of the Group. Therefore, the RCF’s interest rate is used as the base for calculating the effective incremental borrowing rate. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

In addition, note 28 to these consolidated financial statements includes the Group’s financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. The Cash EBITDA of the Group is an industry accepted measure of a business’s cash flow generation. The Group has demonstrated strong performance during the year ended 31 December 2019 with Cash EBITDA of £496.0m, an increase of £82.5m on the year ended 31 December 2018. The Group is in a net asset position of £159.6m at 31 December 2019. The business as a whole is cash generative before portfolio acquisitions, generating cash of £452.5m in the year ended 31 December 2019, with operating cash flow after portfolio acquisitions being £37.4m. The Group continually monitors its cash flow requirements to ensure that enough cash is available to meet its commitments. The Group has four main sources of funding at 31 December 2019, €365m, £565m, €415m, €530m and SEK1,280m of listed Senior Secured loan notes (“notes”), £196.5m of listed Senior loan notes, a €455m RCF and a securitisation facility with an option to reset of £255m. There are covenants on the funding which are detailed in note 20. No maintenance covenants have been breached in 2019. The earliest debt maturity horizon is 31 December 2021 and the latest is 10 April 2024, being the RCF and the Securitisation Loan respectively. The Group continues to monitor its funding requirements and will take action to extend or re-negotiate existing facilities, or explore new funding arrangements as appropriate. Management assessed that the combined operating cash flows of the Group, together with the cash resources and future borrowings under the RCF, will be sufficient to fund the Group’s debt and tax servicing requirements as they become due, working capital requirements and anticipated debt purchases. However, the Group’s ability to obtain funding in the future from these sources will depend on its performance and prospects, as well as other factors beyond its control, such factors may include weak economic and capital market conditions. An inability to procure sufficient funding at favourable terms to purchase portfolios as they become available could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition. As one of a number of mitigating measures, the Group is focussed on reducing leverage in line with its guidance of 4.0-3.5x by 2021/2022. Portfolio acquisitions are largely discretionary and provide the Group with significant control of its cash flow. The Group has also completed a comprehensive review of the potential impact of Brexit, including assessing the potential impact on customers, colleagues, clients and funding. This review did not identify any material issues which would affect the going concern of either the UK business or the Group. Overall, there are long term business plans and short term forecasts in place which are reviewed and updated on a regular basis by management. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 18 months from the signing date.

The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of completion) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. At acquisition, non-controlling interest (“NCI”) is measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRS standards. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits) respectively. On a business combination the portfolio investments are recalculated to fair value using an appropriate discount rate at the date of acquisition, calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date. The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year from the date of acquisition. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Goodwill is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Total goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. If there is evidence of impairment in any CGU, goodwill allocated to that CGU is also tested for impairment. The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate discount rate. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rated basis in relation to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Acquired portfolio investments are held to collect contractual cash flows of payments of solely principal and interest, recognising them at amortised cost and in line with IFRS 9. The effective interest rate (“EIR”) is the rate that exactly discounts the day one estimated future cash receipts of the acquired portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition, (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). These estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the estimated remaining life of the portfolios and range from 84 months to 120 months. Acquired portfolio investments are acquired at a deep discount and classified as purchased or originated credit impaired (“POCI”) in line with IFRS 9. As a result, the estimated future cash flows and hence EIR, reflect the expected life time credit losses within each portfolio. Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cash flows be deemed greater than previous estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period to derive future cash receipts. The difference in carrying value following an enhanced collection forecast is recognised in the net portfolio write up line item within income, with subsequent reversals also recorded in this line. This line represents the net impairment gains on portfolio investments.

The main assets and liabilities in the Group falling into this category are derivative financial instruments that do not fall under the scope of hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. _Loans and receivables_ Acquired portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value. The portfolios are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. The portfolio investment is analysed between current and non-current in the SFP. The current asset is determined using the expected cash flows arising in the next twelve months after the SFP date. The residual amount is classified as non-current. Portfolio investments include litigation costs which represent upfront fees paid during the litigation process, expected to be recoverable from the customer and added to the customer account balance to be recovered at a later date. Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as ‘Trade and other receivables’.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. _Derecognition of financial assets_ The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each SFP date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods but may have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. This is the case if the contract gives the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This right to control is established if: - The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset; and - The Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. The identified asset should be physically distinct or be implicitly specified at the time the asset is made available. Even if the asset is specified, the Group does not have the right to use the asset if the supplier has the substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use. If the contract is for use of a portion of an asset that is not physically distinct, it is not an identified asset unless it represents substantially all of the capacity of that asset. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received plus any initial direct costs and an estimate of restoration costs. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and includes fixed payments, variable lease payments linked to an index or rate and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. The lease payments are discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate at initial application of IFRS 16 was 4.3%. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.

The calculation of the ERC for each portfolio investment is inherently judgemental as it involves the estimation of future cash flows based upon collections data from the individual debt owed.

Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of its net assets. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired investment portfolios where valuations reflect estimates of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post acquisition performance of the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of the value in use requires an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU after a suitable discount rate has been applied to calculate present value. This inherently involves a number of judgements in that cash flow forecasts are prepared for periods that are beyond the normal requirement of management reporting, and the appropriate discount rate relevant to the business is an estimate.

The acquisition was made through Lowell Nordics Oy (formerly Hansa Bidco Oy, formerly Pofidax Oy), an indirect subsidiary of the Company. The carve-out comprised Lindorff’s entire business in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden as well as Intrum Justitia’s entire business in Norway and was specified by the European Commission as a condition of the combination of the two companies in 2017. The business in Estonia, Lowell Eesti AS, had been a small part of Lowell Nordics’ and was subsequently disposed of in July 2019 to allow Lowell to focus on its core market. The combined business added a greater scale and diversification in terms of a broader geographic reach, a more balanced revenue mix together with a complementary and client-focused product offering. In the nine months to 31 December 2018 the Carve-out Business contributed £9.7m profit to the consolidated net loss for the period and £142.9m to consolidated income. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, management estimates that Group income would have been £42.2m higher and Group net loss would have been £3.2m lower.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to three aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The CGUs identified are the UK, comprising of all subsidiary companies operated in the UK owned by Simon Bidco Limited, DACH, consisting of all subsidiary companies operated in DACH owned by Lowell Holding GmbH and Nordics, consisting of all subsidiary companies operated in the Nordic region owned by Lowell Nordics Oy. Foreign currency denominated goodwill is retranslated at each balance sheet date and gives rise to the currency translation effect shown above. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to collections and direct costs during the forecast period. The Group uses cash flow forecasts from the latest budgets, prepared for the next four years and extrapolates these forecasts into perpetuity, using growth rates of 1.5% to 2.0%. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGU’s are based upon the subsidiary group’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and are as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Under this agreement, the Garfunkelux Group managers shall enter into a nominee agreement with Garfunkelux Nominee S.à r.l. (“Nominee”), pursuant to which Nominee shall be the registered shareholder of the shareholder instruments as nominee for the Garfunkelux Group managers and these managers should be the beneficial owners of the shareholder instruments held by Nominee. The Garfunkelux Group managers subscribed for shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant. The Garfunkelux Group managers further agreed, in the same agreement, to sell back to Garfunkelux Invest S.à r.l., the main shareholder of Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l., the shares owned in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. in the event they cease to be an employee and/or a corporate officer of the Group. The selling price of the shares is determined on the basis of a number of conditions including the service period and whether the Garfunkelux Group manager qualifies as good leaver or bad leaver. The sale price of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. owned by the Garfunkelux Group managers will be settled in cash. In the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group, this arrangement has been classified as equity settled transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with the Garfunkelux Group managers. However since the amount paid by the Garfunkelux Group managers for the subscription of the shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. are at fair value, the awards have no material fair value at grant date and therefore there is no expense recognised in the SCI for the year or previous year. |Trade payables ............................................................................................

The Garfunkelux Group managers subscribed for shares in Garfunkelux Holdco 1 S.à r.l. at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.

This includes the risk of changes caused by market variables such as prices, type and timing of debt coming to the market, i.e. the cost of consumer debt portfolios. In bidding for consumer debt portfolios, the Group seeks to achieve a sufficient yield to cover both the cost of collection and overhead costs, thereby minimising the risk of not recovering the cost of these portfolios. The Group uses sophisticated pricing models along with extensive customer and market data to establish the profitability of portfolios coming to market. The Group monitors its pricing assumptions through Investment Committees (subsets of the Executive Committee).

The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios. All portfolios by their nature are impaired on acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections. Carrying values are impaired when and if the underlying performance does not meet initial expectations. The ongoing risk is managed through utilising a comprehensive portfolio valuation model and building current expectations of recoverability from information on debt types and customers into pricing assumptions and models.

The unobservable inputs in determining the fair value are the discount rate and service cost percentage which differ for portfolios that are not deemed as “paying” at the point of acquisition and those that are deemed as “paying”. A “paying” portfolio is determined at the point of acquisition based on the proportion of accounts within that portfolio that are set up on a payment plan. The discount rates have been determined from benchmarking. The service cost percentage is the percentage used to discount the gross cash flows to net and is based on historical information on costs to collect. - The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Foreign exchange swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Pension obligations were calculated in accordance with the requirements set out in IAS 19. An interest rate of between 1.7% and 2.2% (2018: 1.7% and 2.8%), depending on the group of beneficiaries, was used for this purpose. The defined benefit obligation arising from the defined benefit plans was determined in accordance with IAS 19. The calculations took into account estimated increases in pensions and salaries as well as an employee turnover rate. Pension increases were estimated at 1.0% to 1.5% (2018: 1.0 to 1.5%), salary increases at 0.0% to 2.0% (2018: 0.0% to 2.0%), and the employee turnover rate in a range from 0.0% to 2.0% (2018: 0.0% to 2.0%). The employee turnover rate, in particular, depends on the age of the pension beneficiaries. Mortality and invalidity rates were measured for the German companies using the 2005 G Heubeck mortality tables. The pension plan for one of the former members of the Executive Board of Lowell Financial Services GmbH includes a retirement pension entitlement when the beneficiary reaches the age of 60. This retirement pension is equivalent to up to 75% of the average fixed salary over the five years immediately prior to retirement. The pension entitlement for two former employees of GFKL PayProtect GmbH comprises a retirement pension to be paid when the beneficiary reaches the age of 65. Following the transfer of employees from the ERGO Group, Sirius Inkasso GmbH recognised provisions for pensions for the first time in 2006. The pension entitlement comprises a lifelong retirement pension paid when the beneficiary retires from the service of the entity upon reaching the age of 65. A total of 13 employees at Sirius Inkasso GmbH have the benefit of this pension entitlement. Pension entitlements have also been granted to employees of Proceed Collection Services GmbH as a result of the transfer of 19 employees from Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG (now UniCredit Bank AG).

All audits assess and challenge the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Directors, such as recoverability of intangible assets, goodwill, receivables and deferred taxes, and related disclosures and the appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. All of these depend on assessments of the future economic environment and the Group’s future prospects and performance. Brexit is one of the most significant economic events for the UK, and at the date of this report its effects are subject to unprecedented levels of uncertainty of outcomes, with the full range of possible effects unknown. We applied a standardised firm-wide approach in response to that uncertainty when assessing the Group’s future prospects and performance.

IFRS 15 established a five step approach to accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. Contracts relating to third party contingent collection services (“3PC”) and other service contracts were reviewed by the Group against the five steps of IFRS 15. Revenue is earned by the Group through commission based contracts and fee based contracts. In a commission based contract revenue is based on a % commission of the payments received from clients and in a fee based contract revenue is based on agreed upon fees.

The following new Standard is in issue and has been endorsed by the EU but is not yet effective for these consolidated financial statements. IFRS 16 – Leases – effective 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on balance sheet accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The only exemptions to this are short-term leases and leases of low value items. The Group has completed a comprehensive project across all regions to review its leasing arrangements in light of IFRS 16. On application from 1 January 2019, IFRS 16 is expected to have the following key impacts on the Group’s financial statements: - The Group will recognise new right-of-use assets of c£49m and lease liabilities of c£54m for its operating leases as at 1 January 2019. These are primarily building, car and IT related leases. - Previously, the Group recognised operating lease expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Under IFRS 16, this operating lease expense will be replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the lease liabilities. As a result, profit before tax is expected to reduce by c£1.0m in 2019. The Group will apply IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 and intends to apply the modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 being recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at 1 January 2019.

The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of completion) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. At acquisition, non-controlling interest (“NCI”) is measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRS standards. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits) respectively. On a business combination the portfolio investments are recalculated to fair value using an appropriate discount rate at the date of acquisition, calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date. The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year from the date of acquisition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Goodwill is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Total goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Additionally, if there is evidence of impairment in any CGU, goodwill allocated to that CGU is also tested for impairment. The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate discount rate. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rated basis in relation to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Acquired portfolio investments are held to collect contractual cash flows of payments of solely principal and interest, recognising them at amortised cost and in line with IFRS 9. The effective interest rate (“EIR”) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts of the acquired portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition, (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). These estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the estimated remaining life of the portfolios and range from 84 months to 120 months. An initial EIR is determined at the acquisition of the portfolio investment, following this there is a short period that is required to adjust the EIR due to the complexity of the portfolios acquired. Reassessing and changing the EIR in this way does not have a material impact on the financial statements. Acquired portfolio investments are acquired at a deep discount and classified as purchased or credit impaired (“POCI”) in line with IFRS 9. As a result the estimated future cash flows, and hence EIR, reflect the likely credit losses within each portfolio. Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cash flows be deemed greater than previous estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period to derive future cash receipts. The difference in carrying value following an enhanced collection forecast is recognised in the net portfolio write up line item within income, with subsequent reversals also recorded in this line. This line represents the net impairment gains on portfolio investments. As part of the acquisition accounting around the purchase of Metis Bidco Limited by Simon Bidco Limited on 13 October 2015 the portfolio investments were uplifted to their fair value at the date of acquisition. The portfolio fair value release represents the unwinding of this fair value uplift (see note 15). This uplift is being unwound in line with the standard profile of a gross ERC curve of these portfolios. _Service revenue_ Service revenue represents amounts receivable for tracing and debt collecting services (commissions and fees) provided to third party clients including collection lawyers, net of VAT where applicable. Performance obligations within service contracts are the collection of cash and hence these are satisfied when Group collects on debt. Payment is due from clients shortly after cash is collected on their behalf. Revenue is recognised when performance obligations are satisfied.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Such assets or liabilities are initially recognised at cost, which at this point equates to fair value. They must be measured subsequently at fair value. The main assets and liabilities in the Group falling into this category are derivative financial instruments that do not fall under the scope of hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. _Loans and receivables_ Acquired portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value. The portfolios are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. The portfolio investment is analysed between current and non-current in the SFP. The current asset is determined using the expected cash flows arising in the next twelve months after the SFP date. The residual amount is classified as non-current. Portfolio investments include litigation costs which represent upfront fees paid during the litigation process, expected to be recoverable from the customer and added to the customer account balance to be recovered at a later date. Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as ‘Trade and other receivables’. Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables (including Trade receivables) when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. The Group has forward flow agreements in place in relation to the future acquisition of portfolio investments. The fair value and subsequent amortised cost of portfolios acquired under these agreements are determined on the same basis as the Group’s other acquired portfolio investments. _Impairment of financial assets_ Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit or loss / SCI (“FVTPL”), are assessed for indicators of impairment at each period end. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. _Derecognition of financial assets_ The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises collateralised borrowings for the proceeds received. _Financial liabilities and equity_ Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. _Financial liabilities_ All financial liabilities held by the Group are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, except for those measured at fair value through the SCI, e.g. derivative liabilities. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. ----- **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 1.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)** _Derivative financial instruments_ The Group does not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the SCI because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end. _Deferred tax_ Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each SFP date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the SFP date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the SCI, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. _VAT_ Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of VAT, except: - Where the VAT incurred on purchased goods and services cannot be reclaimed from the tax authorities, in which case the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of the asset or as an expense. - Receivables and liabilities are stated with the amount of VAT included.

Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of its net assets. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired investment portfolios where valuations reflect estimates of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post acquisition performance of the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of the value in use requires an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU after a suitable discount rate has been applied to calculate present value. This inherently involves a number of judgements in that cash flow forecasts are prepared for periods that are beyond the normal requirement of management reporting, and the appropriate discount rate relevant to the business is an estimate.

The acquisition was made through Lowell Nordics Oy (formerly Hansa Bidco Oy, formerly Pofidax Oy), an indirect subsidiary of the Company. The carve-out comprises Lindorff’s entire business in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden as well as Intrum Justitia’s entire business in Norway and was specified by the European Commission as a condition of the combination of the two companies in 2017. The combined business will benefit from greater scale and diversification in terms of broader geographic reach and a more balanced revenue mix together with a complementary and client-focused product offering. In the nine months to 31 December 2018 the Carve-out Business contributed £9.7m profit to the consolidated net loss for the period and £142.9m to consolidated income. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, management estimates that Group income would have been £42.2m higher and Group net loss would have been £3.2m lower. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018. _Provisional identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed_ The following table summarises the provisional recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Revenue is earned by the Group through commission based contracts and fee based contracts. In a commission based contract revenue is based on a % commission of the payments received from clients and in a fee based contract revenue is based on agreed upon fees. The current assessment is that IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on any of the Group’s revenue streams. IFRS 16 – Leases– effective from 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on balance sheet approach to lease accounting for lessees with optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items.

The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of completion) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. At acquisition, non-controlling interest (“NCI”) is measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRS standards. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits) respectively. On a business combination the portfolio investments are recalculated to fair value using an appropriate discount rate at the date of acquisition, calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date. The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year from the date of acquisition. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Goodwill is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Total goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Additionally, if there is evidence of impairment in any CGU, goodwill allocated to that CGU is also tested for impairment. The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate discount rate. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rated basis in relation to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Acquired portfolio investments are financial instruments that are accounted for using IAS 39 (Financial Instruments), and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate (“EIR”) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts of the acquired portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition, (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). These estimated future cash receipts are reflective of the conditions within the markets which the Group operates and range from 84 months to 120 months. Acquired portfolio investments are acquired at a deep discount and as a result the estimated future cashflows reflect the likely credit losses within each portfolio. Increases in portfolio carrying values can and do occur should forecasted cashflows be deemed greater than previous estimates and because of the rolling nature of the period to derive future cash receipts. The difference in carrying value following an enhanced collection forecast is recognised in the portfolio write up line item within revenue, with subsequent reversals also recorded in this line. If these reversals exceed cumulative revenue recognised to date, an impairment is recognised in the SCI. As part of the acquisition accounting around the purchase of Metis Bidco Limited by Simon Bidco Limited on 13 October 2015 the portfolio investments were uplifted to their fair value at the date of acquisition. The portfolio fair value release represents the unwinding of this fair value uplift (see note 14). This uplift is being unwound in line with the profile of gross ERC over an 84 month period, in keeping with a standard collection curve profile in the UK. _Service revenue_ Service revenue represents amounts receivable for tracing and debt collecting services (commissions and fees) provided to third party clients including collection lawyers, net of VAT where applicable.

Such assets or liabilities are initially recognised at cost, which at this point equates to fair value. They must be measured subsequently at fair value. The main assets and liabilities in the Group falling into this category are derivative financial instruments that do not fall under the scope of hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39. _Loans and receivables_ Acquired portfolio investments are acquired from institutions at a substantial discount from their face value. The portfolios are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. The portfolio investment is analysed between current and non-current in the SFP. The current asset is determined using the expected cash flows arising in the next twelve months after the SFP date. The residual amount is classified as non-current. Portfolio investments include litigation costs which represent upfront fees paid during the litigation process, expected to be recoverable from the customer and added to the customer account balance to be recovered at a later date. The release to the SCI is in line with the collection profile. Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as ‘Trade and other receivables’. Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables (including Trade receivables) when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. The Group has forward flow agreements in place in relation to the future acquisition of portfolio investments. The fair value and subsequent amortised cost of portfolios acquired under these agreements are determined on the same basis as the Group’s other acquired portfolio investments. _Impairment of financial assets_ Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit or loss / SCI (“FVTPL”), are assessed for indicators of impairment at each period end. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,636

Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the SCI because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end. _Deferred tax_ Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each SFP date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the SFP date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the SCI, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.

The cost is recognised in employee benefits expense together with a corresponding increase in equity (other capital reserves), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period).

Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of its net assets. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired investment portfolios where valuations reflect estimates of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post acquisition performance of the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of the value in use requires an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU after a suitable discount rate has been applied to calculate present value.

The final letter from the German Federal Ministry of Finance on 2 December 2015 clarified the treatment in respect of the purchase of NPLs and includes the expected grandfathering rules.
