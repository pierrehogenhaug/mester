1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"We are the largest pure-play specialty distributor of Foodservice Packaging (“FSP”) and Janitorial Sanitation (“Jan-San”) products in the United States. We serve as a mission-critical partner to approximately 65,000 customers, providing product expertise and technical know-how across a portfolio of over 60,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”). We have deeply entrenched supplier relationships and serve as the critical link between hundreds of suppliers and thousands of customers. Our complementary product offering provides a one-stop shop for customers across a broad range of growing end markets including grocery and convenience stores, foodservice, hospitality, healthcare, and education. Our core FSP products include food containers and trays, paper and plastic bags, cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, films, wraps, while our core Jan-San products include a broad range of cleaning supplies and chemicals, as well as personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and food safety products. Due to our unparalleled scale and flexibility, we are able to provide eco-friendly alternatives across a wide range of our products allowing us to stay at the forefront of legislation and industry trends. Additionally, we offer private label products through our Victoria Bay brand, comprising over 1,300 SKUs. We are a critical, value-added partner to both our suppliers and customers that leverages our unique perspective across end-customer preferences, behavior changes and regulatory developments to help them make important decisions about their businesses. We have a national footprint of 60 warehouses and 20 cross-docks, strategically located across the United States, totaling over 4.5 million square feet of warehouse space. We have a highly experienced sales team of over 650 personnel and 40 equipment technicians. We continue to realize significant efficiencies as we migrate our footprint to a single ERP system, S2K, and consolidate selected smaller facilities into larger supersites. We also operate a fleet of over 1,000 delivery vehicles and trailers, delivering over 3.5 million orders annually on a next day basis. Our fleet can profitably serve customers within approximately 150 miles of a warehouse and 50 miles of a cross-dock. With a structurally advantaged business model, we believe that our customers choose us for a number of reasons, including breadth and availability of our competitively priced products, technical expertise and support, geographic footprint, and consistent and timely delivery. Our ability to serve as a one-stop shop for all FSP and Jan ----- San needs allows our customers to consolidate distributors and simplify procurement management, which differentiates us from national broadline distributors and smaller specialty distributors, who may not have the product breadth or expertise to effectively compete. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we reported Management Pro Forma Revenue and Management Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $2,432 million, and $227.9 million, respectively. Please refer to the “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data” for additional detail.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our History,9.2.1,,"Robert and Jason Tillis acquired Imperial Bag & Paper Company in 2007 and implemented an aggressive growth strategy to scale from one facility servicing the Northeast, to eighty facilities nationwide with the ability to service customers from coast-to-coast. In 2016, after completing six acquisitions and roughly tripling in size, the Company partnered with Audax Private Equity (“Audax”) to further accelerate growth. In 2017, Imperial Bag & Paper completed the transformational acquisition of Dade Paper, forming a leading independent platform in the U.S. and rebranding as Imperial Dade. Together, Audax and the Company completed sixteen acquisitions, including Dade Paper, which provided greater density in the markets already being served and access to new end markets and geographies. In June 2019, Bain Capital acquired a majority stake in Imperial Dade and since then has completed twelve acquisitions in the highly fragmented space.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Foodservice Packaging,9.4.1,,"FSP is our largest offering with an expansive portfolio with over 60,000 SKUs. Sourced from an extensive network of domestic and international suppliers, our FSP offering spans a wide variety of product types and various price points, catering to our diverse end markets including restaurants, grocery and convenience stores, healthcare, educational institutions, hospitality, cruise lines, and many others. Our products include containers, cups, bags, plates and bowls, films and wraps, custom printed items, trays, cutlery and other products. Our expansive product breadth, including eco-friendly and customizable SKUs, is differentiated versus national broadline distributors and smaller specialty distributors that typically only offer a fraction of the SKUs we do. Increasingly, customers seek customized products tailored to their needs, and turn to us to work with manufacturers to create and deliver these products. Our scale, supplier relationships, resources and national footprint allow us to capitalize on these opportunities and drive organic growth.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Janitorial Sanitation,9.5.1,,"With a complete product suite to support our customers’ facility maintenance and sanitation programs, our Jan-San offering is highly complementary to our FSP products, providing significant cross-sell opportunities. Our products include towels and tissues, chemicals and soaps, liners, hygiene apparel, janitorial supplies, dispensers and other equipment. We determine product requirements with customers through on-site product consultations aimed at helping customers optimize efficiency and comply with health and safety standards. Our sales professionals bring deep technical and end market expertise to ensure that customers comply with regulations, particularly in areas such as hygiene and food preparation. This high-touch, collaborative approach, further differentiates our product and service offering versus competitors. We also offer a range of additional value-add services, including equipment installation, repairs and maintenance, and chemical consulting services. Jan-San equipment and servicing is a significant differentiator from both smaller specialty distributors, who lack the resources to invest in services, and national broadline distributors, who cannot profitably provide the same level of service and attention. ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- growth in both traditional direct and third-party (e.g. GrubHub) food delivery systems, which support demand for FSP products offered by specialty distributors. _Concept Proliferation_ Customers are increasingly brand conscious and restaurants have been pushing for differentiated packaging to increase brand awareness. High-quality packaging improves the perception of food quality and customers increasingly rely on consultative sales teams to recommend new options and products to help optimize their businesses. _Sustainability_ Regulatory pressures and consumer demand for sustainable products are driving a sustained shift to environmentally-friendly materials. Our deep supplier relationships and strong sales capabilities help us capture benefits arising from these shifts. _Focus on Hygiene and Safety_ The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an increase in demand for sanitation and hygiene products as requirements for cleanliness and safety in order to prevent the transmission of the disease are becoming more stringent and customers are demanding cleaner and more sanitary environments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Competitive Landscape,9.6.1,,"The market of FSP and Jan-San specialty distributors is highly fragmented, with few pure-play competitors of scale. Our scaled specialty offering is valued by customers and suppliers, due to our deep product knowledge and SKU breadth, long-standing relationships, and flexibility to meet complex demands in a variety of end markets. Small, regional distributors and national broadline distributors similarly offer more limited portfolios of FSP and Jan-San products and therefore struggle to compete with our offering on SKU breadth, service, and pricing. In addition, these players lack the value-add services which drive customer stickiness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,Our Competitive Strengths Recession-resilient Markets Benefitting from Secular Tailwinds,9.7.1,,"The FSP and Jan-San markets are resilient to economic downturns due to the consumable and mission critical nature of the products, which are characterized by inelastic customer demand. Our product breadth and entrenched relationships with both customers and suppliers create significant competitive advantages for us to continue to serve customers through cycles and gain share from less flexible competitors. In addition, secular tailwinds, including demographic shifts, transition towards convenience and health of prepared foods, mass adoption of home food delivery, increasing importance of brand awareness and a shift towards environmentally friendly, sustainable packaging, all support stable, sustained growth over time. We are particularly well-positioned to benefit from heightened focus on sustainability, which has been further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustainability supports growth in higher-margin products where our differentiated offerings, such as compostable containers, paper straws, and high-quality, eco-friendly cleaning chemicals and supplies, as well as greater use of design-forward, custom-branded, and eco-friendly packaging, serve as a source of differentiation for customers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Structurally Advantaged Business Model Offers a Differentiated Value Proposition,9.8.1,,"Our business model enables us to consistently win business and gain market share from competitors. Local and small distributors lack the sophistication and comprehensive product and service offering to effectively compete with our platform. Customers increasingly expect SKU breadth and flexible logistics capabilities requiring scale and infrastructure that smaller operations are unable to offer. National broadline distributors primarily focus on selling ----- ----- operators that rely on our value-add sales approach to effectively manage day-to-day operations. As we continue to scale, we have meaningful opportunities to increase share with large national and super regional customers. We are also a critical partner to suppliers, providing superior, single-point access to a vast and growing customer base. Our scale and extensive reach create a unique channel to introduce new products and increase penetration with customers. We have established deep supplier relationships through a team of 60 procurement specialists. The team manages these relationships actively and works closely with suppliers to facilitate new product launches. Furthermore, our scale gives us significant leverage with suppliers. As a result, we have been able to achieve enhanced pricing and more favorable rebate programs over time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

We achieved over 20x Management Pro Forma Revenue growth and over 32x customer expansion over the period through core organic growth as well as successful M&A and integration.

Free Cash Flow Conversion for fiscal year 2020 was 98.5%. We operate with a flexible cost structure (approximately 75% variable costs) enabling us to respond to changing markets. For each of the last three fiscal years, capital expenditures have represented less than 1.0% of Management Pro Forma Revenue. Capital expenditures primarily relate to growth, including new facilities, while maintenance expenditures have been less than $4 million for each of the last three fiscal years. As a result, Free Cash Flow has been consistent and growing from $94 million in 2018 to $224 million in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, Free Cash Flow Conversion has increased from 96.3% in fiscal year 2018 to 98.5% in fiscal year 2020, a 2.2% increase.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our financial performance.,13.1.1,,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and continues to spread in the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. Related government and private sector responsive actions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation is rapidly evolving and variant strains of the virus have led to increased uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain, affected consumer preferences and the demand for our products and may also cause disruptions to our operations if a significant number of employees are quarantined or if they are otherwise limited in their ability to work at our locations or travel. In addition, certain of our customers continue to have limitations on their ability to conduct their business and pay for products previously purchased. As a result, in 2020 we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $3.8 million related to these specific customers. Any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the unknown potential impact of variant strains, and any future actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by federal, state or local authorities, including those that order the shutdown of non-essential businesses or limit the ability of our employees to travel to work, could impact our ability to take or fulfill our customers’ orders and operate our business. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our personnel are working remotely, and it is possible that this could have a negative impact on the execution of our business plans and operations. The increase in remote working may also result in consumer privacy, IT security and fraud concerns, as well as an increase in our exposure to potential wage and hour issues. Further, as a result of COVID-19, the operations of our distribution centers may be substantially disrupted by additional federal or state mandates ordering shutdowns of non-essential services or by the inability of our employees to travel to work. Our plans to open new distribution centers or to expand the capacity of our existing distribution centers over the next few years may also be delayed or become more costly as a result of the continuing spread of COVID-19 and its variant strains. Disruptions to the operations of our distribution centers and delays or increased costs in the expansion of our distribution center capacity may negatively impact our financial performance and slow our future growth. The uncertainty around the duration of business disruptions and the extent of the spread of the virus in the United States and to other areas of the world will likely continue to adversely impact the national or global economy and negatively impact consumer spending. The duration of the pandemic itself and the market and workplace disruptions it has caused, including disruptions imposed by federal, state and local actions, as well as the potential for new government regulations, and the long-term effects on the economy and our customers are uncertain and as yet unknowable. These factors, as they become more certain, could adversely affect our workforce, sales and overall business The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our operations and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact on capital and financial markets and any new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, its spread to other regions as well as the actions taken to contain it, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business operations, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations and financial results for a period of time that is currently unknown. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers and make it difficult to maintain our market share and profitability.,13.2.1,,"The business-to-business distribution industry is highly competitive, with numerous regional and local competitors, and is a mature industry characterized by slowing revenue growth. Our competitors include national, regional and local distributors, specialty distributors, national and regional manufacturers, and other merchants and brokers. Most of these competitors generally offer a wide range of services at prices comparable to those we offer. Additionally, new competition could arise from non-traditional sources, group purchasing organizations, ecommerce, discount wholesalers or consolidation among competitors. New competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases, or may require increased discounting. Such competition may result in margin erosion or make it difficult to attract and retain customers. Increased competition within the industry, reduced demand for paper products (including as a result of COVID-19) and general economic conditions have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins, and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and profitability. If existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we may be required to lower prices, which would hurt our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.,13.3.1,,"Historically, a portion of our growth has come from strategic acquisitions. We continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions. At any given time, we may be evaluating one or more acquisitions or engaging in acquisition negotiations. We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to identify acquisition candidates or joint venture partners on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the success of any acquisition, including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies, depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen operating, contract and supply chain difficulties, such as the failure to retain existing clients or attract new clients, maintain relationships with suppliers and other contractual parties, or retain and integrate acquired personnel and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention and our financial and other resources. If management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer. In addition, cost savings that we expect to achieve, for example, from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale or synergies, may take longer than expected to realize or may ultimately be smaller than we expect. Likewise, we cannot be sure we will be able to obtain necessary financing for acquisitions. Such financing could be restricted by the terms of our debt agreements or it could be more expensive than our current debt. The amount of such debt financing for acquisitions could be significant and the terms of such debt instruments could be more restrictive than our current covenants. Although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. The failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses, or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. Possible future acquisitions could also result in additional contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets being incurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations represent a significant portion of our assets. If goodwill or other intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, we would need to take a charge to earnings to write down these assets to their fair value. At any time we may have outstanding indemnification escrows supporting seller obligations in connection with our prior acquisitions. These amounts can range from $0 to $8,250,000. Currently, no indemnification claims have been made or are currently expected to be made against us under any acquisition agreement. Under certain ----- acquisition agreements, we may be subject to working capital adjustments, earn-out obligations or holdback amounts for certain post-closing expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,"An inability to open new, cost effective distribution centers may adversely affect our expansion efforts.",13.4.1,,"We plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. The opening of new distribution centers is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion. Our ability to open new distribution centers depends on our ability to identify attractive locations, negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms, identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations, zoning laws and other similar factors. Any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts, and, consequently, adversely affect our financial performance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,The loss of any of our significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition.,13.5.1,,"Our success depends on our ability to retain our current clients, renew our existing client contracts and obtain new business on commercially favorable terms. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We currently operate on a purchase-order-only basis with the majority of our customers and suppliers. When we renew existing client contracts, it is often on terms that are less favorable or less profitable for us than the initial contract terms. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new business, renew existing client contracts at the same or higher levels of pricing or that our current clients will not turn to competitors, cease operations, elect to self-operate or terminate contracts with us. These risks may be exacerbated by the current COVID-19 pandemic due to, among other things, increased cost pressure at our clients and heightened competition in a contracted marketplace. Our ten largest customers generated approximately 17% of our consolidated total sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or improve our relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply these customers at historic levels. Generally, our customers are not contractually required to purchase any minimum amount of products. Should such customers purchase products sold by us in significantly lower quantities than they have in the past, such decreased purchases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, consolidation among customers could also result in changes to the purchasing habits and volumes among some of our present customers. The loss of one or more of these significant customers, a significant customer’s decision to purchase our products and services in substantially lower quantities than they have in the past, or a deterioration in the relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.6,We may be adversely affected if clients reduce their outsourcing or use of preferred vendors.,13.6.1,,"Our business and growth strategies depend in large part on the continuation of a current trend toward outsourcing services. Clients will outsource if they perceive that outsourcing may provide quality services at a lower overall cost and permit them to focus on their core business activities. We cannot be certain this trend will continue or not be reversed or that clients that have outsourced functions will not decide to perform these functions themselves. In addition, labor unions representing employees of some of our current and prospective clients have occasionally opposed the outsourcing trend as they believed that current union jobs for their memberships might be lost. In these cases, unions typically seek to prevent public sector entities from outsourcing and if that fails, ensure that jobs that are outsourced continue to be unionized, which can reduce our pricing and operational flexibility with respect to such businesses. ----- We have also identified a trend among some of our clients towards the retention of a limited number of preferred vendors to provide all or a large part of their required services. We cannot be certain this trend will continue or not be reversed or, if it does continue, that we will be selected and retained as a preferred vendor to provide these services. Unfavorable developments with respect to either outsourcing or the use of preferred vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.7,"We purchase all of the products we sell to our customers from other parties, and conditions beyond our control, including changes in vendor rebates, can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs.",13.7.1,,"As a distributor, we obtain our foodservice packaging, chemicals, and cleaning and janitorial supplies from third-party suppliers. Our business and financial results are dependent on our ability to purchase products from suppliers not controlled by us that we, in turn, sell to our customers. We may not be able to obtain the products we need on open credit, with market or other favorable terms, or at all. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 27% of our purchases were made from our top ten suppliers. A sustained disruption in our ability to source products from one or more of the largest of these vendors might have a material impact on our ability to fulfill customer orders resulting in lost sales and, in rare cases, damages for late or non-delivery. For the most part, we do not have a significant number of long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us. Suppliers may not provide the products and supplies needed in the quantities and at the prices and times requested. We are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control. These conditions include raw material shortages, environmental restrictions on operations, work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers, product recalls, transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs, competitive demands, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, and pandemics or epidemics such as COVID-19. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice packaging, chemicals, and cleaning and janitorial supplies as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors. In addition, some of our agreements with our top customers contain customary delivery requirement provisions, including obligations to deliver the correct brand and item specification and to deliver the products on the date(s) specified in each purchase order. Under some of our agreements, in the event a delivered product is not the contracted brand, the customer is entitled to treat any such product as test samples free of charge. Furthermore, the terms on which we purchase products from certain of our suppliers entitle us to receive a rebate based on the volume of our purchases. These rebates effectively reduce our costs for products. If suppliers adversely change the terms of some or all of these programs, the changes would increase our product costs. Any increase in our product costs would reduce our margins if we are unable to pass all or a portion of these increased costs along to our customers, which we have historically had difficulty doing. Any such inability may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.8,"Increased operating costs, changes in energy and fuel prices and changes in the prices of raw materials used in our products could constrain our ability to make a profit.",13.8.1,,"Our profitability can be adversely affected to the extent we are faced with cost increases for food, wages, other labor related expenses (including workers’ compensation, state unemployment insurance and federal or state mandated health benefits and other healthcare costs), insurance, piece goods, clothing and equipment, especially to the extent we are unable to recover such increased costs through increases in prices for our services, due to general economic conditions, competitive conditions or contractual provisions in our client contracts. For example, when federal, state, foreign or local minimum wage rates increase, we may have to increase the wages of both minimum wage employees and employees whose wages are above the minimum wage. We may also face increased operating costs resulting from changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations relating to employment matters, including those relating to the classification of employees, employee eligibility for overtime and secure scheduling requirements, which often incorporate a premium pay mandate for scheduling deviations. The price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for fuel and other energy-related products, actions by energy producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production ----- patterns, limits on refining capacities, natural disasters, environmental concerns and viral pandemics such as COVID-19. Substantial increases in the cost of fuel and utilities have historically resulted in substantial cost increases for us and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers. The cost of fuel and third-party freight affects the price paid by us for products as well as the expense incurred to deliver products to our customers. Increases in fuel and third-party freight costs or the unavailability of third-party freight providers may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, changes in prices for raw materials, such as pulp, paper and resin, could significantly impact our results of operations in the foodservice packaging market. Although we do not produce our products and are not directly exposed to risk associated with production, declines in pulp and paper prices, driven by falling secular demand, periods of industry overcapacity and overproduction by our suppliers, may adversely affect our revenues and net income to the extent such factors produce lower paper prices. Declining pulp and paper prices generally produce lower revenues and profits, even when volume and trading margin percentages remain constant. During periods of declining pulp and paper prices, customers may alter purchasing patterns and defer paper purchases or deplete inventory levels until long-term price stability occurs. Alternatively, if prices for raw materials rise and we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers, our results of operations and profits may also be negatively impacted.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.9,"The coverage afforded under our insurance policies may be inadequate for the needs of our business or our third-party insurers may be unable or unwilling to meet our coverage requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",13.9.1,,"We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance, including our participation in a “group” captive reinsurance program with a company licensed and managed in the Cayman Islands, to manage the exposures related to our business operations. The captive reinsurance company reinsures our workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile insurance policies. In doing so, it is party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a portion of the risk from our insurance providers to the captive insurance company. As a shareholder in the captive reinsurance company, we are party to the company’s shareholder agreement which covers assessments payable by the shareholders of the company in respect of their coverage. Under this shareholder agreement, we are required to, among other things, post collateral to secure payment of annual assessments and we have posted a $14.5 million letter of credit in respect of these obligations. Such an arrangement could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves. As our business continues to develop and diversify, we may choose to or have to transfer more risk to the captive insurance company as it may become more difficult to obtain insurance with current retentions or deductibles and with similar terms to cover our exposure. Our insurance reserves account includes unpaid losses, loss adjustment expenses for risks, and other associated expenses. These amounts are based on our estimates of the aggregate liabilities for the claims incurred. While these reserves are believed to be adequate, our ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are also subject to new, varied and ever-changing rules and regulations at the state and local level, including social distancing and other operational requirements, capacity limitations, cleaning and sanitation standards and travel restrictions, which have materially impacted our operations across client locations and business sectors. Expenditures related to the cost of compliance with laws, rules and regulations, tariffs and duties could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, government agencies may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations. We could incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, laws, regulations, codes and common law. We could also be held liable for the costs to address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site. In addition, changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, may lead to additional compliance or other costs that could impact our business and results of operations. Under U.S. federal and state environmental protection laws, as an owner or operator of real estate we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous materials located on or in or migrating from our owned or leased property or our client’s properties, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage, without regard to our fault, knowledge, or responsibility for the presence of such hazardous materials. There can be no assurance that locations that we own, lease or otherwise operate, either for ourselves or for our clients, or that we may acquire in the future, have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. In addition, such regulations may limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded facilities. In connection with our present or past operations and the present or past operations of our predecessors or companies that we have acquired, hazardous substances may migrate from properties on which we operate or which were operated by our predecessors or companies we acquired to other properties. We may be subject to significant liabilities to the extent that human health is adversely affected or the value of such properties is diminished by such migration. Moreover, as environmental issues, such as climate change, have become more prevalent, U.S. and foreign governments have responded, and may continue to respond, with increased legislation and regulation, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

Changes or new interpretations in, or changes in the enforcement of, the statutory or regulatory framework applicable to services provided under government contracts or bidding procedures, including an adverse change in government spending policies or appropriations, budget priorities or revenue levels, particularly by our food and support services businesses, could result in fewer new contracts or contract renewals, modifications to the methods we apply to price government contracts, or in contract terms of shorter duration than we have historically experienced. Any of these changes could result in lower revenue or profits than we have historically achieved, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our contracts with U.S. federal, state and local governments and agencies generally contain customary government contract terms and conditions, including covenants against contingent fees, restrictions on gifts and gratuities, including lobbying, and good faith requirements to work with minority- and women-owned businesses. Further, these agreements contains most favored nations obligations, which require us to provide the applicable customer with the most favorable terms and/or prices for substantially similar services or products. The breach of ----- any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default of the applicable agreement, which, if not cured or waived could result in an action for significant money damages against the Company. From time to time, government agencies have also conducted reviews and audits of certain of our practices as part of routine inquiries of providers of services under government contracts, or otherwise. Like others in our business, we also receive requests for information from government agencies in connection with these reviews and audits.

Historically, the effects of collective bargaining and other similar labor agreements have not been significant. However, if a larger number of our employees were to unionize, including in the wake of any future legislation or administrative regulation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, the effect may be negative. Any inability to negotiate acceptable new contracts under these collective bargaining arrangements could cause strikes or other work stoppages, and new contracts could result in increased operating costs. If any such strikes or other work stoppages occur, or if additional employees become represented by a union, a disruption of our operations and higher labor costs could result. Labor relations matters affecting our suppliers of products and services could also adversely affect our business from time to time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in ----- increased pension costs in future periods. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, Helpers, Messengers, Production & Office Workers Pension Fund, which is a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. The risks of participating in multi-employer pension plans differ from single employer-sponsored plans and such plans are subject to regulation under the Pension Protection Act (the “PPA”). Additionally, changes in regulations covering these plans could increase our costs and/or potential withdrawal liability. Multi-employer pension plans are cost-sharing plans subject to collective-bargaining agreements. Contributions to a multi-employer plan by one employer are not specifically earmarked for its employees and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan are borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if a multi-employer plan is determined to be underfunded based on the criteria established by the PPA, the plan may be required to implement a financial improvement plan or rehabilitation plan that may require additional contributions or surcharges by participating employers. In addition to the contributions discussed above, we could be obligated to pay additional amounts, known as withdrawal liabilities, upon decrease or cessation of participation in a multi-employer pension plan. Although an employer may obtain an estimate of such liability, the final calculation of the withdrawal liability may not be able to be determined for an extended period of time. Generally, the cash obligation of such withdrawal liability is payable over a 20-year period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

As we do not have direct control over the quality of the products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of the products and equipment we sell, distribute and service. It is possible that inventory from a manufacturer or supplier could be sold to our customers and later be alleged to have quality problems or to have caused personal injury, subjecting us to potential claims from customers or third parties. Our ability to hold such manufacturer or supplier liable will depend on a variety of factors, including its financial viability. Moreover, increasing the number of private label products that we distribute could increase our exposure to potential liability for product liability claims. Finally, even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products or equipment we distribute, claims of this nature could negatively impact our reputation and customer confidence in our products, equipment and company. Our business also exposes us to worker compensation claims and other employment-related claims. As a result of COVID-19, our employees may be subject to heightened risks for COVID-19 exposure thus potentially impacting their health and future worker compensation claims against us. We may also be subject to lawsuits from employees and others exposed to COVID-19 at our facilities, which could involve large demands and substantial defense costs. We also operate a significant number of facilities and a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles and therefore face the risk of premises-related liabilities and vehicle-related liabilities including traffic accidents. From time to time, we may also be involved in government inquiries and investigations, as well as class action, employment and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by government authorities. The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty. There can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim or its effect on our business or financial condition will be as expected. The defense of these lawsuits and claims may divert our management’s attention, and significant expenses may be incurred as a result. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or ----- become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we currently maintain insurance coverage to address some of these types of liabilities, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or that any such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. In addition, we may choose not to seek to obtain such insurance in the future.

These measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors, net price paid to our vendors, or our sale of certain products to customers and may include negotiated pricing arrangements. We account for vendor arrangements as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales. Accounting for vendor consideration includes uncertainty since we estimate the amount earned based on our actual purchases plus our forecast of total remaining purchases for the year relative to the purchase levels stated in the vendor arrangements. We accrue vendor consideration on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable. Our estimates for annual purchases, future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections, which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including changes in economic conditions. Changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates, as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors. If market conditions were to change, vendors may change the terms of some or all of the applicable contracts. Although such changes would not affect the amounts, we have recorded related to products already purchased, they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods. Receivables from vendor rebates amounted to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. To the extent that our estimates of vendor rebates for each reporting period are not accurate or the terms of our vendor arrangements change, it could affect our operating results in future periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

The taxes and fees remitted by us are subject to review and audit by the applicable governmental authorities which could result in liability for additional assessments. We may also be held liable for failing to obtain valid sales tax exemption certificates from our customers. In addition, we are subject to unclaimed property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time. We are subject to audit by individual U.S. states with regard to our escheatment practices. The legislation and regulations related to tax and unclaimed property matters tend to be complex and subject to varying interpretations by both government authorities and taxpayers. Although management believes that the positions we have taken are reasonable, various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions we have taken, which may also potentially result in additional liabilities for taxes, unclaimed property, interest and penalties in excess of accrued liabilities. Our positions are reviewed as events occur such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits, the measurement of additional estimated liabilities based on current calculations, the identification of new tax contingencies or the rendering of relevant court decisions.

These systems support a variety of functions including inventory management, order placement and processing with vendors and from customers, shipping, shipment tracking and billing. Our information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, wide-area telecommunications or power utility outages, terrorist or cyber-attacks and other major disruptions, and our redundant information systems may not operate effectively. Failures or significant downtime of our IT or telecommunications systems including our enterprise resource planning or ERP systems, for any reason could prevent us from taking customer orders, printing product pick-lists, shipping products, billing customers and handling call volume. Sales also may be adversely impacted if our reseller and retail customers are unable to access pricing and product availability information. We also rely on the Internet, electronic data interchange and other electronic integrations for a large portion of our orders and information exchanges with our suppliers and customers. The Internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns, some of which were caused by organized attacks. In addition, some websites have experienced security breakdowns. If we were to experience a security breakdown, disruption or breach that compromised sensitive information, it could harm our relationships with our suppliers and customers. Disruption of our website or the Internet in general could impair our order processing or more generally prevent our suppliers and resellers from accessing information. Failures of our systems could also lead to delivery delays and may expose us to litigation and penalties under some of our contracts. Any significant increase in our IT and telecommunications costs or temporary or permanent loss of our IT or telecommunications systems could harm our relationships with our customers and suppliers and result in lost sales, business delays and bad publicity.

We maintain confidential, proprietary and personal information about, or on behalf of, our potential, current and former clients, customers, employees and other third parties in these systems or engage third parties in connection with storage and processing of this information. Such information includes large volumes of employee, client and third party data, including credit card numbers, social security numbers, healthcare information and other personal information. Our IT systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyber-attacks, including malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, including through phishing emails, attempts to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information, the exploitation of software and operating vulnerabilities, and physical device tampering. The risk of cyberattacks is heightened with many of our employees working and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until after an attack is launched or occurs. As a result, we and such third parties may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption of systems availability, or denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us. Access to internal applications required to plan our operations, source materials, ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. We currently own a small portfolio of registered and applied-for intellectual property including trademarks, copyrights and domain names. Theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, could stem from such incidents. Any operational disruptions or misappropriation of information could harm our relationship with our customers and suppliers, result in lost sales, business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ----- In addition, we or third parties engaged by us to assist with storage and processing of information may decide to upgrade existing information technology systems from time to time to support the needs of our business and growth strategy and the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyber-based attacks and other attempts to compromise our information systems, although none, to our knowledge, has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any damage to, or compromise or breach of our systems or the systems of our vendors could impair our ability to conduct our business, result in transaction errors, result in corruption or loss of accounting or other data, which could cause delays in our financial reporting, and result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, reputational damage, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures. Any such event could cause us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with systems remediation, client protection, litigation, lost revenue or the failure to retain or attract clients following an attack. The failure to properly respond to any such event could also result in similar exposure to liability. While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Further, as cybersecurity risks evolve, such insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Changes to U.S. trade policies, including the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, sanctions and other related governmental actions or policies, can disrupt geographic and industry demand trends and prompt other countries to change their own trade policies, including through the adoption of retaliatory tariffs or expansion of other trade restrictions. For example, the Trump Administration previously raised tariffs, and imposed new tariffs, on a wide range of imports of Chinese products. Given the recent change in the United States presidential administration, there is uncertainty whether there will be, any changes to U.S. government trade policy. These changes may cause us to make changes in our supply chain strategies or adversely impact our own costs. Increasing the costs of our products as a result of tariffs or other adverse trade restrictions, or minimizing the number of our products subject to tariffs or other adverse trade restrictions, could cause customers to turn to other distributors and we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers at acceptable costs.

Disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports or the closure of roads or imposition of other driving bans due to natural events such as flooding, tornadoes and blizzards may affect our ability to both maintain key products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, widespread outbreaks of an illness such as a pandemic and actions taken to contain or prevent further spread of such diseases could substantially interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply which may be more expensive, unavailable or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers. Further, if our customers’ businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in the United States, federal, state and local authorities have implemented and continue to implement various security measures that affect many parts of the transportation ----- network in the United States and abroad. Our customers typically require delivery of products in short time frames and rely on our on-time delivery capabilities.

Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for our services, resulting in the loss of business or increased pressure to contract for business on less favorable terms than our generally preferred terms. Increases in labor costs, including the cost to provide employee-partner related healthcare benefits, minimum wages, labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor, regulations regarding the classification of employees and/or their eligibility for overtime wages, higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles, the inability to obtain insurance coverage at cost-effective rates, higher interest rates, inflation, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses. As a result, these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations. For example, during the current COVID-19 pandemic, or in the past, such as in the period of economic distress following the financial crisis of 2008, certain of our businesses are being or were negatively affected by reduced employment levels at our clients’ locations and declining levels of business and consumer spending. In addition, financial distress and insolvency experienced by clients, especially larger clients, in the past has, currently does, and in the future could make it difficult for us to collect amounts we are owed and could result in the voiding or modification of existing contracts. In addition, volatility in the global capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of our Company and our customers. Financial difficulties of customers, whether as a result of a downturn in general economic or industry conditions or otherwise, may result in failures of customers to timely pay amounts due or adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The restrictions in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby may prevent us and our subsidiaries, as applicable, from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not subject to similar restrictions. We may also incur additional debt obligations in the future that could subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our and our subsidiaries’ financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we and our subsidiaries will be able to maintain compliance with such covenants and, if we and/or our subsidiaries fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our and our subsidiaries’ results of operations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives, our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy or changes in general economic conditions, which may be beyond our and our subsidiaries’ control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default or event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, which, if not cured or waived could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date.

Lower net revenues before provision for uncollectibles, or higher provision for uncollectibles, generally will reduce our cash flow. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, including those for integrating our historical acquisitions or for future corporate development activities. We also may be forced to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes. Any restructuring or refinancing of all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If we breach our covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we would be in default thereunder. The lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

As a result, increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our subsidiaries’ debt, even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and could materially reduce our consolidated profitability and cash flows. While the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge its interest rate exposures related to its variable rate borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, it is possible that these agreements or any future interest rate cap agreements or swaps that it enters into may not fully or effectively mitigate its interest rate risk. The Company may also decide not to maintain interest rate swaps in the future. As a result of such increases in the cost of servicing our subsidiaries’ debt, our subsidiaries may be unable to make distributions to us, which would negatively impact our ability to make Cash Interest payments or to repay the notes offered hereby. In addition, a transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (for purposes of this risk factor, “LIBOR”) as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate may affect the cost of servicing our subsidiaries’ debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Financial Conduct Authority of the United ----- Kingdom has announced that it plans to phase out LIBOR by June 30, 2023. Although these borrowing arrangements provide for alternative base rates, such alternative base rates may or may not be related to LIBOR, and the consequences of the phase–out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

The terms of additional financing may limit our financial flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our subsidiaries’ future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we and our subsidiaries may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could materially and adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

We may not have the funds to fulfill these obligations or the ability to obtain third party financing to fulfill these obligations on satisfactory terms or at all. If the maturity date occurs at a time when other arrangements prohibit us from repaying the notes, we could try to obtain waivers of such prohibitions from the lenders and holders under those arrangements, or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions.

These subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes, or to make any funds available therefore, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we have to receive any assets of any of the subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of such subsidiaries’ creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of such subsidiaries. You should not expect these subsidiaries to participate in making any payments in respect of the notes. As of December 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, our subsidiaries would have had: (i) approximately $968.0 million of secured indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain assets and capital leases to which the notes would have been effectively subordinated, and (ii) commitments available to be borrowed under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities of approximately $245 million (excluding $14.5 million of letters of credit expected to be issued thereunder). All such obligations of our subsidiaries will be structurally senior to the notes. If any of our subsidiaries become insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves or otherwise winds up, holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to us. Consequently, claims in respect of the notes will be structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, and the claims of creditors of these subsidiaries, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of such subsidiaries, will have priority as to the assets of these subsidiaries. In addition, the indenture governing the notes will permit these subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, subject to some limitations, and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

Although there can be no assurance that the notes offered hereby will ever be rated investment grade, or if they are rated investment grade, that such notes will maintain these ratings, any suspension of the covenants under the indenture that will govern the notes would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect.

A court might do so if it found that when we issued the notes, or in some states when payments became due under the notes, we received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and: - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - were left with inadequate capital to conduct our business; - believed or reasonably should have believed that we would incur debts beyond our ability to pay; or - were a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. The court might also void an issuance of notes, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that we issued the notes with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors. A court would likely find that we did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes if we did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. Because we are using the proceeds from this offering in part to fund a return of capital to our equityholders, a court could conclude that we did not receive reasonably equivalent value. If a court were to void the issuance of the notes you would no longer have any claim against us. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received in respect of the notes. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making such a determination. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (a) the holder of notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (b) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of notes and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

Any future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes (including any liens delivered or reinstated and/or pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued) may be avoidable by the guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (1) the guarantor is insolvent at the time of the issuance of the guarantee, (2) the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such guarantee had not been given and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the issuance of the guarantee or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the notes and any guarantees not issued, on the issue date of the notes had been issued less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the issue date of the notes (even if the other guarantees issued on the issue date of the notes would no longer be subject to such risk).

Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations that would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will also contain exceptions that permit us to undertake certain corporate and tax transactions without complying with the covenants contained in the indenture, including certain tax planning and tax reorganization transactions and reorganizations in preparation for any initial public offering. These transactions could permit value to be transferred from our company and our restricted subsidiaries, including additional tax distributions to our stockholders, without being subject to restrictions under the indenture. In addition, one of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law and the interpretation of that phrase will likely depend upon particular facts and circumstances.

1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Impact of COVID-19,17.4.1,,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. States and cities have taken various measures in response to COVID-19, including mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings. Our operations are and have been continuously open for business since we are among businesses that generally have been considered essential by federal, state, or local authorities. One of our highest priorities is the health, safety and security of our employees. We have adapted our operations and implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer environment for both our customers and employees, which includes following best practices and guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”). We continue to monitor developments to minimize potential exposures and facilitate safe and healthy environments in our branches, warehouses, and other facilities. FSP was our most impacted business due to the effect that COVID-19 had on our restaurants and hospitality end markets. We were able to partially offset this decline through increased product demand within the grocery and healthcare end markets. ----- Although we have experienced operational and other challenges to date, there has not been a material adverse impact on our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as a result of COVID-19. We believe we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue business operations during this volatile period. In March 2020, we borrowed against the ABL Facility further enhancing our cash position and increasing our financial flexibility. In December 2020, the last of these borrowed amounts was repaid and as of December 31, 2020, the total ABL Facility is available to us. Between March 2020 and June 2020, we took steps to reduce operating costs by reducing our workforce by approximately 7%. However, as of December 31, 2020, employee workforce is up 4% as compared to March 2020, due to our response to COVID-19 as well as a result of our fiscal year 2020 acquisitions. We continue to access our discretionary spending on a routine basis and may take additional steps to reduce operating costs. Certain of our customers continue to have limitations on their ability to conduct their business and pay for products previously purchased. As a result, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $3.8 million related to these specific customers. However, we have not recorded any impairments of tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill. We continue to actively monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations if required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates, customers, and suppliers. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material impact to our Company increases the longer the virus impacts the level of economic activity in the United States. For this reason, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on our results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

We typically do not require our customers to provide collateral. Accounting for doubtful accounts contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectability of their accounts. When preparing these estimates, management considers several factors, including the aging of a customer’s account, past transactions with customers, historical collection trends, and other information, including information we obtain during our collection efforts around specific customers’ business and economic conditions. We provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging. These reserves range from approximately 2% for amounts currently due to up to 100% for specific accounts more than 120 days past due.

Accounts receivable balances greater than 120 days past due as a percent of accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 increased to 10.5% from 6.2% at December 31, 2019. These increases were primarily attributable to slower collections related to active customers within the foodservice packaging business. In addition, we believe there is increased risk associated with collections on certain outstanding receivables as a result of COVID-19, and as a result, we have incurred an additional allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.8 million in fiscal year 2020 for customers who have stopped making payments. This $3.8 million represents approximately 85% of the total accounts receivables balances related to customers who are inactive. During the year, we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. These write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts. In the past three years, write-offs have averaged less than 0.12% of net sales annually. We expect that write-offs will not materially increase as a percentage of net sales in 2021. Although we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is within a range of acceptable estimates, a decline in economic conditions could lead to the deterioration in the financial condition of our customers, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments and requiring additional allowances that could materially impact our consolidated results of operations. We believe our exposure to customer credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
1085_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.36,Critical accounting policies and estimates,17.36.2,Vendor programs,"We enter into vendor arrangements that provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve certain contractually agreed-upon measures. These measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors, net price paid to our vendors, or our sale of certain products to customers and may include negotiated pricing arrangements. We account for vendor arrangements as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales. Accounting for vendor consideration includes uncertainty since we estimate the amount earned based on our actual purchases plus our forecast of total remaining purchases for the year relative to the purchase levels stated in the vendor arrangements. We accrue vendor consideration on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable. Our estimates for annual purchases, future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections, which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including changes in economic conditions. Changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates, as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors. We continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect newly executed agreements, actual purchase levels and identifiable trends. As a result, our estimated monthly vendor consideration accrual may include cumulative catch-up adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods. These adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the second half of the year because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods. We update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase or sales levels. In the first quarter of the subsequent year, we prepare a ----- retrospective review by comparing actual vendor consideration received to the prior year vendor receivable balances. There were no material adjustments recorded within fiscal year 2020 or fiscal year 2019. If market conditions were to change, vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs. Although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased, they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

In determining fair value of identifiable intangible assets, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts. Management’s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. As part of the estimation process, thirdparty valuation specialists are engaged to assist in the valuation of these identifiable intangible assets. Our judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each identifiable intangible asset, as well as asset lives and depreciation and amortization methods, have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For instance, the determination of asset lives impacts our consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss as different types of identifiable intangible assets have different useful lives. Identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of our estimates of fair value for finite-lived customer relationships. Customer relationships were valued using a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. This measure of fair value also requires considerable judgments about future events, including attrition, contract renewal estimates and technology changes. In determining the estimated lives and method of amortization for finite-lived intangibles, we use a method and life that closely follows the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

We perform a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment. To the extent the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value, we record a goodwill impairment charge for the difference, up to the carrying value of the goodwill. We recognize any impairment losses in operating income. For assessing goodwill impairment, we are comprised of a single reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows in addition to the market approach with 33% weighted towards the income approach and 67% weighted towards the market approach. We project future cash flows under the income approach using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates, operating margins and discount rates. These estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test. We also review for potential impairment indicators at the one reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends, current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate. In the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not recognize any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. If our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted, we could incur impairment charges in future periods. Impairment charges would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

The shift in consumer preference towards food delivery has fueled strong growth in both traditional direct and third-party (e.g. GrubHub) food delivery systems, which support demand for FSP products offered by specialty distributors. _Concept Proliferation_ Customers are increasingly brand conscious and restaurants have been pushing for differentiated packaging to increase brand awareness. High-quality packaging improves the perception of food quality and customers increasingly rely on consultative sales teams to recommend new options and products to help optimize their businesses. _Sustainability_ Regulatory pressures and consumer demand for sustainable products are driving a sustained shift to environmentally-friendly materials. Our deep supplier relationships and strong sales capabilities help us capture benefits arising from these shifts. _Focus on Hygiene and Safety_ The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an increase in demand for sanitation and hygiene products as requirements for cleanliness and safety in order to prevent the transmission of the disease are becoming more stringent and customers are demanding cleaner and more sanitary environments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

In addition, secular tailwinds, including demographic shifts, transition towards convenience and health of prepared foods, mass adoption of home food delivery, increasing importance of brand awareness and a shift towards environmentally friendly, sustainable packaging, all support stable, sustained growth over time. We are particularly well-positioned to benefit from heightened focus on sustainability, which has been further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

National broadline distributors primarily focus on selling food, which tends to involve higher gross margin dollar per square foot products, possess higher operating costs, and require more complex infrastructure to distribute, including climate-controlled trucks and warehouses.

FSP and Jan-San customers have unique purchasing needs which require a highly trained sales force to advise and optimize product selection. Amazon lacks the salesforce, customer service and expertise to win and retain customers that are accustomed to specialty distribution. Furthermore, Amazon does not provide additional value-added services, such as equipment installation, repairs and maintenance that are important to customers and typically provided by specialty distributors. Lastly, being able to deliver products in a narrow time frame, often after business hours and through the use of a security code to gain access to the premises, is not something that Amazon’s last mile network is set up to consistently do well. This is a market with relatively low margins and small profit pools, making it difficult to be successful without having a specialized and dedicated infrastructure. Amazon’s existing warehouses and last-mile network are not designed to offer bulk delivery of high-cube items, which makes it challenging to deliver these products at similar prices and earn a reasonable margin. We are positioned as a partner for customers to help drive the success of their operations. We offer a broad and complementary range of products, which provides customers with a one-stop shop for all their FSP and Jan-San product requirements, providing us significant cross-sell opportunities.

The Issuer’s ability to make any cash payments to the Holders is limited by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which limit the ability of OpCo’s Subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make required cash payments under the Notes. See “Description of Existing Indebtedness” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes— We are a holding ----- company with no independent operations or assets. Repayment of the notes is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries. ” Any right of the Issuer to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon that Subsidiary’s bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of that Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be subordinate in right of payment to any security interest in the assets of the Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of that Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of Indebtedness and all other liabilities of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer on their consolidated balance sheet was approximately $1,260.7 million (net of capitalized debt issuance costs of $36.3 million), and OpCo and its Subsidiaries had an additional $245.0 million available for borrowing on a secured basis under the ABL. As indicated above, payments on the Notes will be structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We will have substantial indebtedness and may incur additional debt in the future, including secured debt, which could substantially reduce our profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes.” As of the date of the Indenture, all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” Under the circumstances described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants of the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and the Issuer. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. A sale, lease or other disposition by the Issuer of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of the assets retained by the Issuer exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuer that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with respect to such assets. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Issuer’s sales, leases or other dispositions of less than substantially all of its assets. ----- The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause ----- (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, any future obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. On and after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or of the occurrence of a Reversion Date or to independently determine if such events have occurred.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense ----- for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by the Issuer; For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or Total Assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction; (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the ----- applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, the Applicable Percentage shall be (1) 50% if, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Asset Disposition and the use of proceeds therefrom the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of OpCo would be less than or equal to 6.50 to 1.00 but greater than 6.00 to 1.00, or (2) 0.00% if, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Asset Disposition and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of OpCo would be less than or equal to 6.00 to 1.00. Any Net Available Cash in respect of an Asset Disposition that does not constitute Applicable Proceeds as a result of the application of this definition shall collectively constitute “Total Leverage Excess Proceeds.” If, with respect to any Asset Disposition, at the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset Disposition, there remains Applicable Proceeds in excess of the greater of $60 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are equal to the greater of $60 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Declined Excess Proceeds,” and such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $60 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) no later than ten business days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to all Holders of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of such Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to, but not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notices of an Asset Disposition Offer shall be sent by first class mail or sent electronically, at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each Holder of the Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to the Applicable Proceeds by making an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period (the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, any other Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Disposition Offer made with Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) is less than the amount offered in an Asset Disposition Offer, the Issuer may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes or, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered pursuant to any Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available Cash or Applicable Percentage of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary or a CFC Holding Company (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative ----- impediments from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or agreements or other impediments will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Issuer hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the Issuer’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or other impediments to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other impediment, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly (and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of, or an obligation to repatriate, any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates and/or direct or indirect equity owners would incur a Tax liability, including receipt of a Tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding Tax, the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this covenant shall require the Issuer to cause any amounts to be repatriated to the United States (whether or not such amounts are used in or excluded from the determination of the amount of any mandatory prepayments hereunder). The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $40 million and 17.5% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). ----- To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be required to (i) comply with Sections 302, 906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any information, certificates or reports required by Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K. To the extent any such information is not so filed or furnished, as applicable, within the time periods specified above and such information is subsequently filed or furnished, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured; provided that such cure shall not otherwise affect the rights of the Holders under “— Events of Default” if Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately and such declaration shall not have been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. Substantially concurrently with the furnishing of such information to the Trustee pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Issuer shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to post copies of such information required by the immediately preceding paragraph on a website (which may be nonpublic and may be maintained by the Issuer or a third party) to which access will be given to Holders, prospective investors in the Notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of the Issuer), and securities analysts and market making financial institutions that are, in the case of securities analysts and market making financial institutions, reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer. To the extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding sentence after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuer shall furnish such reports to the Holders of the Notes, upon their request. The Issuer may condition the delivery of any such reports to such Holders, prospective investors in the Notes, and securities analysts and market making financial institutions on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information. The Issuer will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of Notes, prospective investors in the Notes and securities analysts and market making financial institutions, to discuss financial information for the previous quarter (it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the same conference call as with the Issuer’s (or as applicable, any of any Parent Entity’s) equity investors and analysts). The conference call will be following the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Issuer and not later than 10 Business Days from the time that the Issuer distributes the financial information as set forth in the third preceding paragraph. No fewer than two days prior to the conference call, the Issuer will issue a press release or otherwise announce the time and date of such conference call and providing instructions for Holders, securities analysts, prospective investors and market making financial institutions to obtain access to such call. If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted Subsidiaries hold in the aggregate more than 5.0% of the Total Assets of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer. The Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to OpCo or a Parent Entity; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such OpCo or Parent Entity (and other direct or indirect Parent Entities included in such information, if any), as applicable, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted ----- Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Issuer or any Parent Entity of the Issuer has furnished the Holders of Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to the Issuer or any Parent Entity, the Issuer shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this covenant. The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports furnished to it. Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under the Indenture is for informational purposes only and the information and the Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained therein or determinable therefrom, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default (with a copy to the Trustee, if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clause (6), the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated.

In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered to the Trustee), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. ----- Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture and shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because of an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; ----- (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60- day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expenses reductions and synergies resulting from such transactions which is being given pro forma effect. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness).

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, and Holders of the Notes are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof. The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture in its entirety. A copy of the proposed form of the Indenture may be requested as described under “Where You Can Find More Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions.” The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Notes” as so defined.

These potential payments may implicate the ----- provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” One or more contingencies will not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments if, as of the issue date, such contingencies, individually and in the aggregate, are considered remote or incidental. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of these payments does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations, and intend to report consistently with the foregoing for applicable U.S. federal income tax purposes. This position is based on our determination that, as of the issue date of the notes, the possibility that these payments will have to be made is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a Holder, unless such Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, then the notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments and, among other potentially adverse tax consequences, a Holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes based on a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury regulations) in excess of the stated interest and to treat any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than capital gain. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book–Entry Interests. In addition, while the notes are in global form, owners of interest in the Global Notes will not have the notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” of notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

After the expiration of the 40 Day Period, Book–Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book–Entry Interest in the Rule 144A Global Note without compliance with these certification requirements. Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” Book–Entry Interests may be transferred and exchanged. Any Book–Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book–Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book–Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book–Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book–Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book–Entry Interest. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book–Entry Interests in a Global Note only as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book–Entry Interest for 144A Book–Entry Interest will be done by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the DTC Participant through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note.

The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law; - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book–entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. ----- Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book– entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through DTC will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC participants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non–exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of a Covered Plan that engages in such a non–exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer or the initial purchasers are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. ----- In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84–14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90–1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91–38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95–60 respecting life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96–23 respecting transactions determined by in–house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the Issuer of the notes nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction.

This summary also does not discuss notes held as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic security, conversion transaction, or other integrated transaction for tax purposes, or situations in which the “functional currency” of a U.S. Holder is not the United States dollar. Moreover, the effect of any United States federal taxes other than United States federal income taxes (such as estate or gift taxes or the net investment income tax on certain investment income) and any state, local or non–United States tax laws is not discussed. In the case of a Holder that is an entity or other arrangement that is classified as a partnership (or other pass–through entity) for United States federal income tax purposes, the tax treatment of the notes to a partner in the partnership (or other equity holder in a pass–through entity) generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner (or other equity holder) and the activities of the partner and the partnership (or other equity holder and the pass– through entity). If you are a partnership (or other pass–through entity) considering an investment in the notes, then you and your partners (or equity holders) should consult your own tax advisors. _The following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

The Company bases fair value on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Significant differences can arise between the fair value and carrying amounts of financial instruments that are recognized at historical cost amounts. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: - Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. - Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include interest rate swap contracts and contingent consideration related to recent acquisitions. The Company considers interest rate swaps to be a recurring Level 2 fair value measurement (see Note 10). The Company estimates the fair value of these interest rate swaps, including assumptions about counterparty risk, at each balance sheet date using an income approach based on the terms of the interest rate swap contracts and inputs corroborated by observable market data, including interest rate curves. The Company considers contingent consideration included within deferred purchase price to be a recurring Level 3 fair value measurement (see Note 10).

Effective January 1, 2019, for both the Successor and Predecessor Companies, revenues are recognized under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 606, Revenue from _Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), when control of these products is transferred to customers, in an amount that_ reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those products, which is usually upon delivery to customers. As the Company typically bills and ships on the same day, the vast majority of performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time with an insignificant amount, if any, being satisfied over time. Revenue from related maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreements and is insignificant. There was no contract liability (deferred revenue) related to maintenance contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company’s sole performance obligation in the net product sales revenue stream is the sale of goods. Payment terms typically range from due upon receipt to 120 days from invoice. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company recognizes variable consideration in the form of prompt pay discounts, customer rebates, and customer returns. The Company estimates variable consideration based on its history, adjusted for known or anticipated events or circumstances that may affect the estimate, and consideration of whether it is probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of the revenue recognized will not occur in the future. The Company will update its estimates of variable consideration at each reporting date until the prompt pay discount, customer rebate, or customer return related to a contract with a customer, as applicable, is resolved. The liability for sales returns is not significant. The Company offers a basic ----- warranty against defects, which is not considered a separate performance obligation. The Company records contract liabilities representing customer rebates due to customers within accounts payable and accrued expenses (see Note 6). Accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets represent receivables recorded under ASC 606. There were no other contract assets recorded under ASC 606 and/or ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred _Costs – Contracts with Customers, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Sales and other taxes the_ Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are reported within revenue. Other revenues for 2020 and 2019 in both the Successor and Predecessor Periods primarily include income generated from subleasing arrangements related to the Company’s leased properties (see Note 9), which is not considered to be revenue from contracts with customers. Prior to January 1, 2019, revenue was recognized under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, the risk of loss passed to the customer (generally upon delivery), the price was fixed or determinable, and collectability was reasonably assured. Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of sales tax, trade discounts, customer rebates, and customer returns. Net product sales represent revenues from the sale of products. Other revenues for 2018 primarily include income generated from subleasing arrangements related to the Company’s leased properties where the Company is the primary obligor. As discussed above, ASC 606 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605. However, given the nature of the Company’s products and the terms and conditions applicable to sales to its customers, the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on the underlying principles of ASC 606 are consistent with the Company’s revenue recognition policy under ASC 605.

In addition, the pronouncement dealing with stock-based compensation requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and disclosures regarding the cash flow effects resulting from stock-based payment arrangements.

The fair value measurements of intangible assets and contingent consideration were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value _Measurement. The income approach was primarily used to value the intangible assets, consisting primarily of trade_ names (relief-from-royalty method) and customer lists (multi-period excess earnings method). The income approach indicates value for an asset based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money. The discount rates utilized to value the intangible assets ranged from 9% to 23%. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for property and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation. The Company is currently assessing the identification and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisitions of P&R, GSW, Jackson Newell, Industrial Soap, and Paper Chemical as discussed above. The preliminary results, which are summarized above, will be finalized within 12 months following the close of each acquisition. When the valuations are finalized, any changes to the preliminary valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may result in adjustments to the preliminary fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and goodwill. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,248

Using this approach, expected future cash flows are calculated over the expected lives of each agreement and then are discounted. Some of the more significant assumptions made in the valuation include (i) the estimated net revenue forecasts for the relevant acquired companies and (ii) the discount rate. The discount rate utilized to fair value the deferred purchase price at December 31, 2020, ranged from 6.6% to 9.7%. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are included on the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss as selling, general, and administrative expenses. Changes in the fair value of the deferred purchase price in 2020 and the 2019 Successor Period were insignificant. Changes in the fair value of the deferred purchase price liability resulted in an decrease of $355 and $267 to selling, general, and administrative expense during the 2019 Predecessor period and the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively. These liabilities have been classified as Level 3, as the valuation and related inputs require judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market.

Certain provisions of the CARES Act impact the 2019 income tax computations of the Company and will be reflected in the period of enactment. The CARES Act contains modifications on the limitation of business interest for tax years beginning in 2019. The modifications to Section 163(j) increase the allowable business interest deduction from 30% of adjusted taxable income to 50% of adjusted taxable income. This modification would impact the allowable interest expense deduction of the Company and the taxable income for the years ended 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $58,477 and $13,221, respectively. Approximately $58,477 of the federal net operating losses do not expire. Approximately $13,221 of the state net operating losses will begin to expire in 2039. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. Based on this evaluation, no valuation allowance has been recorded. Management has evaluated all significant tax positions at December 31, 2020, and 2019 and concluded that there are no material uncertain tax positions. The Company would recognize both interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Since the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions, there has been no interest or penalties on any unrecognized tax benefits during 2020, the 2019 Successor Period, the 2019 Predecessor Period, or 2018. Tax years 2016 through 2019 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.

States and cities have taken various measures in response to COVID-19, including mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings. The Company’s operations are and have been continuously open for business since we are among businesses that generally have been considered essential by federal, state, or local authorities. One of the highest Company priorities is the health, safety and security of its employees. Management has adapted its operations and implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer environment for both customers and employees, which includes following best practices and guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Company continues to monitor developments to minimize potential exposures and facilitate safe and healthy environments in its branches, warehouses, and other facilities. Although the Company has experienced operational and other challenges to date, there has been no material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as a result of COVID-19. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity on hand to continue business operations during this volatile period. In March 2020, the Company borrowed against its asset-based revolver further enhancing cash position and increasing financial flexibility. In December 2020, the last of these borrowed amounts were repaid, and as of December 31, ----- 2020, the total asset-based revolver is available. Between March 2020 and June 2020, the Company took steps to reduce operating costs by reducing its workforce by approximately 12%. However, as of December 31, 2020, employee workforce is up 22% compared to March 2020, due to management’s response to COVID-19 as well as a result of the Company’s fiscal year 2020 acquisitions. Management continues to access management’s discretionary spending on a routine basis and may take additional steps to reduce operating costs. Certain of the Company’s customers continue to have limitations on their ability to conduct their business and pay for product previously purchased, and management has considered these factors in the allowance for doubtful accounts. However, the Company has not recorded any impairments of tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill. Management continues to actively monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter the Company’s business operations if required by federal, state, or local authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of its associates, customers, and suppliers. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material impact to the Company increases the longer the virus impacts the level of economic activity in the United States. For this reason, management cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2021,248
