We have deeply entrenched supplier relationships and serve as the critical link between hundreds of suppliers and thousands of customers. Our complementary product offering provides a one-stop shop for customers across a broad range of growing end markets including grocery and convenience stores, foodservice, hospitality, healthcare, and education. Our core FSP products include food containers and trays, paper and plastic bags, cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, films, wraps, while our core Jan-San products include a broad range of cleaning supplies and chemicals, as well as personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and food safety products. Due to our unparalleled scale and flexibility, we are able to provide eco-friendly alternatives across a wide range of our products allowing us to stay at the forefront of legislation and industry trends. Additionally, we offer private label products through our Victoria Bay brand, comprising over 1,300 SKUs.

We have a highly experienced sales team of over 650 personnel and 40 equipment technicians.

1085,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our financial performance.,13.1.1,,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and continues to spread in the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. Related government and private sector responsive actions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation is rapidly evolving and variant strains of the virus have led to increased uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain, affected consumer preferences and the demand for our products and may also cause disruptions to our operations if a significant number of employees are quarantined or if they are otherwise limited in their ability to work at our locations or travel. In addition, certain of our customers continue to have limitations on their ability to conduct their business and pay for products previously purchased. As a result, in 2020 we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $3.8 million related to these specific customers. Any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the unknown potential impact of variant strains, and any future actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by federal, state or local authorities, including those that order the shutdown of non-essential businesses or limit the ability of our employees to travel to work, could impact our ability to take or fulfill our customers’ orders and operate our business. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our personnel are working remotely, and it is possible that this could have a negative impact on the execution of our business plans and operations. The increase in remote working may also result in consumer privacy, IT security and fraud concerns, as well as an increase in our exposure to potential wage and hour issues. Further, as a result of COVID-19, the operations of our distribution centers may be substantially disrupted by additional federal or state mandates ordering shutdowns of non-essential services or by the inability of our employees to travel to work. Our plans to open new distribution centers or to expand the capacity of our existing distribution centers over the next few years may also be delayed or become more costly as a result of the continuing spread of COVID-19 and its variant strains. Disruptions to the operations of our distribution centers and delays or increased costs in the expansion of our distribution center capacity may negatively impact our financial performance and slow our future growth. The uncertainty around the duration of business disruptions and the extent of the spread of the virus in the United States and to other areas of the world will likely continue to adversely impact the national or global economy and negatively impact consumer spending. The duration of the pandemic itself and the market and workplace disruptions it has caused, including disruptions imposed by federal, state and local actions, as well as the potential for new government regulations, and the long-term effects on the economy and our customers are uncertain and as yet unknowable. These factors, as they become more certain, could adversely affect our workforce, sales and overall business The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our operations and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact on capital and financial markets and any new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, its spread to other regions as well as the actions taken to contain it, among others.

At any given time, we may be evaluating one or more acquisitions or engaging in acquisition negotiations. We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to identify acquisition candidates or joint venture partners on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the success of any acquisition, including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies, depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen operating, contract and supply chain difficulties, such as the failure to retain existing clients or attract new clients, maintain relationships with suppliers and other contractual parties, or retain and integrate acquired personnel and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention and our financial and other resources. If management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer. In addition, cost savings that we expect to achieve, for example, from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale or synergies, may take longer than expected to realize or may ultimately be smaller than we expect. Likewise, we cannot be sure we will be able to obtain necessary financing for acquisitions.

During periods of declining pulp and paper prices, customers may alter purchasing patterns and defer paper purchases or deplete inventory levels until long-term price stability occurs. Alternatively, if prices for raw materials rise and we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers, our results of operations and profits may also be negatively impacted.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Because we are using the proceeds from this offering in part to fund a return of capital to our equityholders, a court could conclude that we did not receive reasonably equivalent value. If a court were to void the issuance of the notes you would no longer have any claim against us. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received in respect of the notes. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making such a determination. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (a) the holder of notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (b) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of notes and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

We provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging. These reserves range from approximately 2% for amounts currently due to up to 100% for specific accounts more than 120 days past due. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.0 million and $6.5 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, an increase of $4.5 million. Accounts receivable balances greater than 120 days past due as a percent of accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 increased to 10.5% from 6.2% at December 31, 2019. These increases were primarily attributable to slower collections related to active customers within the foodservice packaging business. In addition, we believe there is increased risk associated with collections on certain outstanding receivables as a result of COVID-19, and as a result, we have incurred an additional allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.8 million in fiscal year 2020 for customers who have stopped making payments. This $3.8 million represents approximately 85% of the total accounts receivables balances related to customers who are inactive. During the year, we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. These write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts. In the past three years, write-offs have averaged less than 0.12% of net sales annually. We expect that write-offs will not materially increase as a percentage of net sales in 2021. Although we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is within a range of acceptable estimates, a decline in economic conditions could lead to the deterioration in the financial condition of our customers, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments and requiring additional allowances that could materially impact our consolidated results of operations.

We serve as a mission-critical partner to approximately 65,000 customers, providing product expertise and technical know-how across a portfolio of over 60,000 SKUs. We have deeply entrenched supplier relationships and serve as the critical link between hundreds of suppliers and thousands of customers. Our complementary product offering provides a one-stop shop for customers across a broad range of growing end markets including grocery and convenience stores, foodservice, hospitality, healthcare, and education. Our core FSP products include food containers and trays, paper and plastic bags, cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, films, wraps, while our core Jan-San products include a broad range of cleaning supplies and chemicals, as well as PPE and food safety products. Due to our unparalleled scale and flexibility, we are able to provide eco-friendly alternatives across a wide range of our products allowing us to stay at the forefront of legislation and industry trends. Additionally, we offer private label products through our Victoria Bay brand, comprising over 1,300 SKUs. We are a critical, value-added partner to both our suppliers and customers that leverages our unique perspective across endcustomer preferences, behavior changes and regulatory developments to help them make important decisions about their businesses. We have a national footprint of 60 warehouses and 20 cross-docks, strategically located across the United States, totaling over 4.5 million square feet of warehouse space. We have a highly experienced sales team of over 650 personnel and 40 equipment technicians. We continue to realize significant efficiencies as we migrate our footprint to a single ERP system, S2K, and consolidate selected smaller facilities into larger supersites. We also operate a fleet of over 1,000 delivery vehicles and trailers, delivering over 3.5 million orders annually on a next day basis. Our fleet can profitably serve customers within approximately 150 miles of a warehouse and 50 miles of a cross-dock. With a structurally advantaged business model, we believe that our customers choose us for a number of reasons, including breadth and availability of our competitively priced products, technical expertise and support, geographic footprint, and consistent and timely delivery.

We serve as a mission-critical partner to approximately 65,000 customers, providing product expertise and technical know-how across a portfolio of over 60,000 SKUs. We have deeply entrenched supplier relationships and serve as the critical link between hundreds of suppliers and thousands of customers. Our complementary product offering provides a one-stop shop for customers across a broad range of growing end markets including grocery and convenience stores, foodservice, hospitality, healthcare, and education. Our core FSP products include food containers and trays, paper and plastic bags, cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, films, wraps, while our core Jan-San products include a broad range of cleaning supplies and chemicals, as well as PPE and food safety products. Due to our unparalleled scale and flexibility, we are able to provide eco-friendly alternatives across a wide range of our products allowing us to stay at the forefront of legislation and industry trends. Additionally, we offer private label products through our Victoria Bay brand, comprising over 1,300 SKUs. We are a critical, value-added partner to both our suppliers and customers that leverages our unique perspective across endcustomer preferences, behavior changes and regulatory developments to help them make important decisions about their businesses. We have a national footprint of 60 warehouses and 20 cross-docks, strategically located across the United States, totaling over 4.5 million square feet of warehouse space. We have a highly experienced sales team of over 650 personnel and 40 equipment technicians. We continue to realize significant efficiencies as we migrate our footprint to a single ERP system, S2K, and consolidate selected smaller facilities into larger supersites. We also operate a fleet of over 1,000 delivery vehicles and trailers, delivering over 3.5 million orders annually on a next day basis. Our fleet can profitably serve customers within approximately 150 miles of a warehouse and 50 miles of a cross-dock. With a structurally advantaged business model, we believe that our customers choose us for a number of reasons, including breadth and availability of our competitively priced products, technical expertise and support, geographic footprint, and consistent and timely delivery.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable law as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. Any Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor or the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor, to a Person other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture; (2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary; (3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; (4) to the extent that such Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of clause (i) of the definition of “Immaterial Subsidiary,” upon the release of the guarantee referred to in such clause; (5) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of (i) its obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Issuer of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Guarantor (each, an “Other Guarantee”) as a result of its guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees,” by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor of the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release ----- as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release); (6) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (7) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that such Note Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and (8) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.” Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders of the Notes.

1085,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.11,Change of Control,21.11.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and the Issuer. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

A sale, lease or other disposition by the Issuer of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of the assets retained by the Issuer exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuer that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with respect to such assets. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Issuer’s sales, leases or other dispositions of less than substantially all of its assets. ----- The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",,as_expected,2021,248,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under \u201c\u2014Optional Redemption,\u201d the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the \u201cChange of Control Offer\u201d) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Issuer\u2019s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and the Issuer. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under \u201c\u2014Certain Covenants\u2014Limitation on Indebtedness\u201d and \u201c\u2014Certain Covenants\u2014 Limitation on Liens.\u201d Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption \u201c\u2014Optional Redemption,\u201d unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of \u201cChange of Control\u201d includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase \u201csubstantially all,\u201d there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of \u201call or substantially all\u201d of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. A sale, lease or other disposition by the Issuer of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of the assets retained by the Issuer exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuer that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with respect to such assets. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Issuer\u2019s sales, leases or other dispositions of less than substantially all of its assets. ----- The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer\u2019s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

(2) additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness may later be reclassified as having been Incurred pursuant to any type of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to such provision and any related Liens are permitted to be Incurred at the time of reclassification (it being understood that any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of such clause but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries could have incurred such Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on such clause); (3) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall be deemed to have been Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant; (4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall not include the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including, without limitation, tender premiums), defeasance costs, fees and other costs and expenses (including, without limitation, original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (8) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; ----- (9) for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, in connection with the incurrence, issuance or assumption of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second paragraph above or the incurrence or creation of any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens” or otherwise, the Issuer may elect, at its option, to treat all or any portion of the committed amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such Lien, as the case may be (any such committed amount elected until revoked as described below, the “Reserved Indebtedness _Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,_ the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other provision of the Indenture, as applicable, is complied with (or satisfied) with respect thereto on such election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to be permitted under this covenant or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other provision of the Indenture, as applicable, at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default); (10) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions), in each case, at the option of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event), or (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent announcement in another jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and any related pro forma adjustments, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed, issued, assumed or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense ----- for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by the Issuer; For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or Total Assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction; (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the ----- applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.",,as_expected,2021,248,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Limitation on Indebtedness\nText: The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that (x) the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), in an aggregate outstanding principal amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $50 million and (b) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA, (y) the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than OpCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries) may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), either (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 or (ii) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Issuer would have been no greater than 7.00 to 1.00, and (z) OpCo and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), either (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for OpCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 or (ii) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of OpCo would have been no greater than 7.00 to 1.00.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or Total Assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing);

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this \u201c\u2014Limitation on Indebtedness.\u201d If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this \u201c\u2014Limitation on Indebtedness,\u201d the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the ----- applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith. In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating to an Investment, the Issuer or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Investment as having occurred on the date of the commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating thereto (such date, the \u201cElection Date\u201d) if, after giving pro forma effect to such Investment and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma adjustments, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment on the relevant Election Date in compliance with the Indenture, and any related subsequent actual making of such Investment will be deemed for all purposes under the Indenture to have been made on such Election Date, including for purposes of calculating any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable) and Consolidated EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of Default (and all such calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission, retraction or rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be made on a pro forma basis giving effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith).

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes or, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered pursuant to any Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination.

The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, any other Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Disposition Offer made with Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) is less than the amount offered in an Asset Disposition Offer, the Issuer may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes or, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered pursuant to any Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available Cash or Applicable Percentage of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary or a CFC Holding Company (a \u201cForeign Disposition\u201d) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative ----- impediments from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or agreements or other impediments will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Issuer hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the Issuer\u2019s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or other impediments to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other impediment, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly (and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of, or an obligation to repatriate, any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates and/or direct or indirect equity owners would incur a Tax liability, including receipt of a Tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding Tax, the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this covenant shall require the Issuer to cause any amounts to be repatriated to the United States (whether or not such amounts are used in or excluded from the determination of the amount of any mandatory prepayments hereunder). The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $40 million and 17.5% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). ----- To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Issuer\u2019s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer\u2019s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, any Guarantor may (a) consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to another Guarantor or the Issuer, (b) consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor, reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Guarantor, (c) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, (d) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if the Issuer determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Issuer and (e) complete any Permitted Tax Restructuring. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, the Issuer may contribute Capital Stock of any or all of its Subsidiaries to any Guarantor. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. A sale, lease or other disposition by the Issuer of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of the assets retained by the Issuer exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuer that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with respect to such assets. Such fair market value shall be established by the delivery to the Trustee of an independent expert’s certificate stating the independent expert’s opinion of such fair market value as of a date not more than 90 days before or after such sale, lease or other disposition.

1085,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.15,Events of Default,21.15.1,,"Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture: (1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days; (2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants— Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has been given; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default: (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross acceleration provision”); and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the greater of $60 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such non-payment or acceleration) or more at any one time outstanding; (5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”); (6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of $60 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such judgment) other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, ----- undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”); or (7) any Guarantee of the Notes by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect, other than (1) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (2) a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture or (3) in connection with the bankruptcy of a Guarantor, so long as the aggregate assets of such Guarantor and any other Guarantor whose Note Guarantee ceased or ceases to be in full force as a result of a bankruptcy are less than the greater of $60 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such bankruptcy). However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default (with a copy to the Trustee, if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clause (6), the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered to the Trustee), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. ----- Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture and shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because of an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; ----- (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60- day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”",,as_expected,2021,248,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture: (1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer\u2019s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a \u201cNotice of Default.\u201d\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expenses reductions and synergies resulting from such transactions which is being given pro forma effect. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness).

The acquisition and/or holding of notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer or the initial purchasers are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. ----- In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84–14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90–1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91–38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95–60 respecting life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96–23 respecting transactions determined by in–house asset managers.

Each of the above–noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

This summary is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this document, and all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. As a result, the tax considerations of purchasing, owning, or disposing of the notes could differ from those described below. We have not sought any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. This summary deals only with beneficial owners of notes (referred to in this section as “Holders”) that purchase the notes for cash in this offering at their initial “issue price” (generally, the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money to investors, not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers), which we assume is the offering price on the first page of this offering memorandum, and that will hold the notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment).

Other intangible assets consist primarily of trade names and customer lists, which were all determined to be definite-lived intangible assets. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.

Effective January 1, 2019, for both the Successor and Predecessor Companies, revenues are recognized under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 606, Revenue from _Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), when control of these products is transferred to customers, in an amount that_ reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those products, which is usually upon delivery to customers. As the Company typically bills and ships on the same day, the vast majority of performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time with an insignificant amount, if any, being satisfied over time. Revenue from related maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreements and is insignificant. There was no contract liability (deferred revenue) related to maintenance contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company’s sole performance obligation in the net product sales revenue stream is the sale of goods. Payment terms typically range from due upon receipt to 120 days from invoice. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company recognizes variable consideration in the form of prompt pay discounts, customer rebates, and customer returns. The Company estimates variable consideration based on its history, adjusted for known or anticipated events or circumstances that may affect the estimate, and consideration of whether it is probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of the revenue recognized will not occur in the future. The Company will update its estimates of variable consideration at each reporting date until the prompt pay discount, customer rebate, or customer return related to a contract with a customer, as applicable, is resolved. The liability for sales returns is not significant. The Company offers a basic ----- warranty against defects, which is not considered a separate performance obligation. The Company records contract liabilities representing customer rebates due to customers within accounts payable and accrued expenses (see Note 6). Accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets represent receivables recorded under ASC 606. There were no other contract assets recorded under ASC 606 and/or ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred _Costs – Contracts with Customers, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Sales and other taxes the_ Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are reported within revenue. Other revenues for 2020 and 2019 in both the Successor and Predecessor Periods primarily include income generated from subleasing arrangements related to the Company’s leased properties (see Note 9), which is not considered to be revenue from contracts with customers. Prior to January 1, 2019, revenue was recognized under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, the risk of loss passed to the customer (generally upon delivery), the price was fixed or determinable, and collectability was reasonably assured. Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of sales tax, trade discounts, customer rebates, and customer returns. Net product sales represent revenues from the sale of products. Other revenues for 2018 primarily include income generated from subleasing arrangements related to the Company’s leased properties where the Company is the primary obligor. As discussed above, ASC 606 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605.

The Company estimates variable consideration based on its history, adjusted for known or anticipated events or circumstances that may affect the estimate, and consideration of whether it is probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of the revenue recognized will not occur in the future. The Company will update its estimates of variable consideration at each reporting date until the prompt pay discount, customer rebate, or customer return related to a contract with a customer, as applicable, is resolved. The liability for sales returns is not significant. The Company offers a basic ----- warranty against defects, which is not considered a separate performance obligation. The Company records contract liabilities representing customer rebates due to customers within accounts payable and accrued expenses (see Note 6). Accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets represent receivables recorded under ASC 606. There were no other contract assets recorded under ASC 606 and/or ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred _Costs \u2013 Contracts with Customers, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Sales and other taxes the_ Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are reported within revenue. Other revenues for 2020 and 2019 in both the Successor and Predecessor Periods primarily include income generated from subleasing arrangements related to the Company\u2019s leased properties (see Note 9), which is not considered to be revenue from contracts with customers. Prior to January 1, 2019, revenue was recognized under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, the risk of loss passed to the customer (generally upon delivery), the price was fixed or determinable, and collectability was reasonably assured. Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of sales tax, trade discounts, customer rebates, and customer returns. Net product sales represent revenues from the sale of products. Other revenues for 2018 primarily include income generated from subleasing arrangements related to the Company\u2019s leased properties where the Company is the primary obligor. As discussed above, ASC 606 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605. However, given the nature of the Company\u2019s products and the terms and conditions applicable to sales to its customers, the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on the underlying principles of ASC 606 are consistent with the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy under ASC 605. Adoption of ASC 606 resulted in minimal changes to the Company\u2019s accounting policies for revenue recognition, trade and other receivables, contract costs, contract liabilities, and deferred costs.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

1085,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2161,REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,2161.52,Determination of the Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed,2161.52.1,,"For all business combinations completed during the year ended December 31, 2020, the 2019 Successor Period, the 2019 Predecessor Period and the year ended December 31, 2018 by the Company, the fair values of the net assets acquired were determined using either the income, cost or market approaches. The fair value measurements of intangible assets and contingent consideration were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value _Measurement. The income approach was primarily used to value the intangible assets, consisting primarily of trade_ names (relief-from-royalty method) and customer lists (multi-period excess earnings method). The income approach indicates value for an asset based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money. The discount rates utilized to value the intangible assets ranged from 9% to 23%. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for property and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation. The Company is currently assessing the identification and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisitions of P&R, GSW, Jackson Newell, Industrial Soap, and Paper Chemical as discussed above. The preliminary results, which are summarized above, will be finalized within 12 months following the close of each acquisition.

[$ ] 1,216,231 $ 888,280 (a) On July 21, 2020, the Company entered in an amendment to the inter-creditor agreement for a revolver loan entered into by the Successor. The Amendment increased the existing revolver amount by $70,000 to a total of $245,000. The incremental increase of the revolver loan has identical terms to the existing inter-creditor agreement as described below. The Company drew $162,500 on the revolver loan which was used to fund the P&R and GSW acquisitions totaling $35,000 and $12,500, respectively, in addition to a $115,000 draw for liquidity and general business purposes associated with the uncertainty during COVID-19 (Note 17). These amounts have been repaid. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding loans on this facility. The Company was in compliance with all bank covenants at December 31, 2020. Successor – On June 11, 2019, and in connection with the Transaction, the Successor Company entered into an inter-creditor agreement for a Revolver loan. The inter-creditor agreement for a Revolver loan provided for up to $175,000 in availability. The inter-creditor agreement for the Revolver loan matures on June 10, 2024. Advances are based on percentages applied to eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The loan bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus the applicable rate, as defined, or the alternative base rate (ABR) plus the applicable base rate, as defined. There are no regularly scheduled principal repayments until maturity. The loan may, depending on the amount drawn, require the Company to meet certain terms and conditions as well as certain financial covenants (including maintenance of certain fixed charge and debt to EBITDA ratios) on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding loans on this facility. The Company was in compliance with all bank covenants at December 31, 2019. (b) During 2020, the Company drew $113,500 and $43,750 on its First Lien and Second Lien term loans, respectively, to help fund the APP, Wagner, P&R and Great Southwest acquisitions. On December 15, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment of the First Lien Loan entered into by the Successor requesting the Term Loan Lenders provide $180,000 of New Term Loans. The Company used the proceeds to repay $162,500 outstanding on the revolver loan. The New Term Loan shall constitute a separate class of term loan than the previous First Lien Loan and is payable in quarterly installments of 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the New Term Loans outstanding on the Amendment’s effective date. The New Term Loan is currently payable in equal quarterly installments of $450 as of December 31, 2020. Interest was being charged based on the higher of (i) 0.75% or (ii) LIBOR + 4.25%. The maturity date for the New Term Loan shall be the Initial Term Loan maturity date of June 11, 2026.
