Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Net Debt, Working Capital and related ratios should not be considered in isolation and are not measures of our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity as derived in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS and non-GAAP financial measures do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash requirements and may not be indicative of our results of operations.

Therefore, estimates provided by Metal Beverage Packaging regarding these markets, as well as estimated market shares of Metal Beverage Packaging or its competitors, are largely based on Metal Beverage Packaging’s knowledge of these markets, developed primarily from analysis of public information, third-party reports to the extent available, competitors’ public announcements and regulatory filings and information gathered in the course of acquisitions. The data relating to market sizes, market share and market position are based on the most recent data available. This information has not been confirmed by an independent organization, nor can there be assurance that third parties would arrive at the same results were they to employ different methods for gathering, analyzing and calculating such data. Breakdowns of market shares were established on the basis of Metal Beverage Packaging’s consolidated revenues and these data. Market positions and percentage shares are those that Metal Beverage Packaging believes it holds in terms of revenues. They are based on industry market sectors on which Metal Beverage Packaging’s group business is arranged. xii ----- Certain additional information regarding the global packaging industry, generally, and the metal can packaging sector, specifically, has been sourced from Smithers Pira. Any third-party information described above and incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum has been accurately reproduced and as far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from the information published by such third parties, the reproduced information is accurate and no facts have been omitted which would render such information inaccurate or misleading. Market share data is subject to change, however, and such third-party information has been prepared for statistical and other informational purposes, which is limited by the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey of market share.",N/A,as_expected,2020,152

Industry publications generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have not independently verified such data. Similarly, while we believe that our internal surveys are reliable, they have not been verified by independent sources and we cannot assure you of their accuracy. Moreover, information and quantitative statements regarding our market position relative to our competitors are not based on published statistical data or information obtained from third parties. Rather, such information and statements reflect our best estimates based upon our internal records and surveys, statistics published by providers of industry data, information published by our competitors, and information obtained from trade and business organizations and associations and other sources within the industry in which we operate. We believe that such data are useful in helping investors understand the industry in which we operate and our position within the industry. However, we do not have access to the facts and assumptions underlying the numerical data and other information extracted from publicly available sources and have not independently verified any data provided by third parties or industry or general publications.

Overall demand has remained resilient to date, reflecting our focus on the beverage and food end use categories. Operationally, we are a core part of the supply chain and all our production facilities have continued to operate normally. Our supply chains have also continued to function satisfactorily to date. We ended the quarter with total cash and committed liquidity of $1.1 billion, including approximately $950 million in cash on hand. This includes proceeds from the Credit Facility (as defined below), drawn in full on March 23, 2020, and does not include proceeds of the Offering. Pro forma for the Offering, total cash and committed liquidity would increase to $1.3 billion, including approximately $1.15 billion in cash. _The above information is based on preliminary results and estimates and is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for the first quarter of 2020.

In addition, while we believe these estimates to be reasonable, our actual results may vary from our preliminary results and estimates above, and such variations could be material.

This is expected to include an adverse effect from reduced global economic activity and resulting demand for our customers’ products and, therefore, the products we manufacture. It may also adversely affect our ability to operate our business, including potential disruptions to our supply chain and workforce. The COVID-19 impact on capital markets could also impact our cost of borrowing. Although it is currently too early to estimate, we expect the ultimate significance of the impact of these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will be determined by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic.

The summary historical financial data as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 has been derived from the Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. The balance sheet information as of December 31, 2017 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements of Ardagh Group S.A. not included or incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. The summary financial data and other data should be read in conjunction with Item 5 ‘‘Operating and Financial Review’’ in the Form 20-F and the Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, both incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future expected results. On October 31, 2019, the Group completed the combination of its Food & Specialty Metal Packaging business with the metal packaging business of the Exal group, to form Trivium Packaging B.V., a global leader in metal packaging (the ‘‘Disposition’’). As a result of the completion of the Disposition, the Food & Specialty Metal Packaging business has been reported as a discontinued operation. As required, the income statement information for the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 has been restated retrospectively in accordance with IFRS 5—Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, to present the results of the continuing operations of the Group. The Group holds approximately 42% of the ordinary shares of Trivium Packaging B.V. As the Group jointly controls both the financial and operating policy decisions of Trivium Packaging B.V., the investment is accounted for as a joint venture under the equity method. The pro forma financial data in respect of pro forma net interest expense, pro forma net debt, ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma net interest expense and ratio of pro forma net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 presented and described in the notes thereto reflects the impact of (i) savings resulting from the repayment of certain notes during the year ended December 31, 2019, (ii) the impact after giving effect to the Credit Facility, and (iii) the impact after giving effect to the Offering.

398_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.1,The outbreak of COVID-19 may have a negative impact on worldwide economic activity and our business.,"The outbreak of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines and prolonged closures of workplaces and other businesses, including hospitality, leisure and entertainment outlets, and the related cancellation of events, will impact our business in a number of ways. This is expected to include an adverse effect from reduced global economic activity and resulting demand for our customers’ products and, therefore, the products we manufacture. It may also adversely affect our ability to operate our business, including potential disruptions to our supply chain and workforce. Although our plants are currently operational and have been to date, they may in the future be required to curtail or cease production in response to the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 impact on capital markets could also impact our cost of borrowing. In addition, our customers, distribution partners, service providers or suppliers may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the outbreak of COVID-19 which would have a negative impact on our business. At this point, the extent of the impact on our results as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain. Although it is currently too early to estimate, we expect the ultimate significance of the impact of these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will be determined by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic. It is expected that the continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown and potentially a recession or depression which would adversely affect the demand for our products or cause other unpredictable events, each of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any future epidemics may also have similar, or more severe, effects on global economic activity and on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 12 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,152

398_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,"Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees",13.2.1,Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes.,"We have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2019, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had (i) total debt of $6,442 million, of which $500 million would have been debt incurred in this offering and (ii) $3,621 million of debt which will mature prior to the maturity of the Notes. As of December 31, 2019, we had additional availability under our main credit facilities of up to $664 million, and all of these borrowings would effectively rank senior to the Notes. Our indirect parent ARD Finance has $1,130 million and A1,000 million aggregate principal amount of Toggle Notes outstanding and is dependent on dividends from us to service the Toggle Notes. Our substantial debt could have important negative consequences for us and for you as a holder of the Notes. For example, our substantial debt could: - require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and fund repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; - increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; - limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future; - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; - make it difficult for us to pay interest or principal on the Notes and our other debt; and - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

These limitations arise under various provisions or principles of corporate law which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective, as well as thin capitalization, unfair consideration, financial assistance, corporate purpose or similar law affecting the rights of creditors generally, and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations were not observed, the Guarantees and the grant of Security Interests by these Subsidiary Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge. In some jurisdictions, the Guarantees will contain language limiting the amount of debt guaranteed or secured so that applicable local law restrictions will not be violated. Certain of the Security Documents will contain similar limitations. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a Subsidiary Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions or seek to enforce a Security Interest in Collateral granted by a Subsidiary Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions, your claims are likely to be limited. In some cases, where the amount that can be guaranteed or secured is limited by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the Subsidiary Guarantor or by reference to the outstanding debt owed by the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor to the Issuers under intercompany loans that amount might have reached zero or close to zero at the time of any insolvency or enforcement.

Most of the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of a number of different jurisdictions outside the United States. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees, limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantee against a Guarantor. The court or an insolvency administrator may also in certain circumstances avoid the Guarantee where the company is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee; - direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee is found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. Also, there is a possibility that the Guarantees may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. 19 ----- In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued, the relevant Guarantor: - issued such Guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Guarantee in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee on the basis that the Guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. - Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; and/or - the present salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the offering of the Notes, there can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was ‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date the Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.",N/A,as_expected,2020,152

There is no assurance that such a 21 ----- structure will be effective before French, German, Polish or Dutch courts as there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. The Security Documents submitted to Italian law provide that the rights with respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes. Under Italian law, a security interest created pursuant to a pledge may not be validly enforceable for the benefit of the beneficiaries who are not a party to the relevant pledge agreement creating the security interest. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not have any security interest in respect of the pledge of our Italian subsidiaries and must rely on the waterfall in the Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,152

Not all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will likely be required to repay financial and trade creditors before distributing any assets to the Issuers or a Guarantor.

If either Issuer, a Guarantor or other applicable withholding agent is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes imposed or levied on behalf of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, such Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay additional amounts (‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each beneficial owner of the Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction in respect of any Additional Amounts) will not be less than the amount the beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted. None of the Issuers or Guarantors will, however, pay Additional Amounts in respect or on account of: (a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the holder’s or beneficial owner’s present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership, holding or disposition of Notes, or by reason of the receipt of any payments in respect of any Notes or any Guarantee, or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Notes or any Guarantee); (b) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes, following the Issuers’ written request addressed to the holder or beneficial owner, to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements (to the extent such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so), whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, such Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a 41 ----- certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction); (c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes; (d) any Tax which is payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee; (e) any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment by any of the Issuers or Guarantors to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that such Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such beneficial owner been the holder of such Note; (f) any Tax that is imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Notes to another paying agent in a member state of the European Union or the United Kingdom; (g) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period); (h) any U.S. federal withholding Taxes or equivalent thereof imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or other official administrative interpretations thereof and any agreements entered into pursuant to current Section 1471(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version described above), and including (for the avoidance of doubt) any intergovernmental agreements (and any law, regulation, rule or practice implementing any such intergovernmental agreement) in respect of the foregoing; or (i) any combination of the foregoing.

The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. The Issuers will promptly publish a notice in accordance with the provisions set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’ stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts. In addition, the Issuers and the Guarantors will pay any present or future stamp, issuance, registration, court, documentary, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including without limitation, interest, penalties and other similar liabilities with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of (i) the execution, issue, delivery or registration of the Notes or any Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder, or (ii) the receipt of any payments under or with respect to, or enforcement of, the Notes or any Guarantee. 42 ----- Upon written request, any of the Issuers or a Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee or a holder within a reasonable time certified copies of tax receipts evidencing any payment by such Issuer or Guarantor (as the case may be) of any Taxes imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, in accordance with the procedures described in ‘‘—Notices’’ hereafter, in such form as provided in the normal course by the taxing authority imposing such Taxes. If, notwithstanding the efforts of such Issuer or Guarantor to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, such Issuer or Guarantor will provide the Trustee or such holder with other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or holder of such payments by such Issuer or Guarantor. If requested by the Trustee, the Issuers and (to the extent necessary) any Guarantors will provide to the Trustee such information as may be reasonably available to such Issuer and the Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee) to enable determination of the amount of any withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder(s). Whenever the Indenture or this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note (including payments thereof made pursuant to a Guarantee), such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts, if applicable.

For the purposes of this paragraph, it will be sufficient for the holder to certify that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of the Required Currency been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of the Required Currency on that date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would have been possible).

Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the Indenture. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor will: (a) cause a notice of the Change of Control Offer to be (i) delivered to holders of the Notes electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid; and (ii) if at the time of such notice the Notes are listed on Euronext Dublin and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, published in _The Irish Times (or another leading newspaper of general circulation in Ireland or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of Euronext Dublin, posted on the official website of Euronext Dublin); and 46 ----- (b) send notice of the Change of Control Offer by first class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each holder of Notes to the address of such holder appearing in the security register, which notice will state: (i) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred; (ii) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control (including, but not limited to, applicable information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization after giving effect to the Change of Control); (iii) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a business day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations; (iv) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid; (v) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and (vi) any other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance (which procedures may also be performed at the office of the paying agent in Ireland as long as the Notes are listed on Euronext Dublin). The Trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated Notes; provided that each such new Note or Notes will be in a total principal amount of at least $200,000 and in minimum denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. The Issuers or the Parent Guarantor will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The ability of the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a Change of Control could constitute a default under certain of our Credit Facilities or could constitute a change of control under the Existing Ardagh Bonds. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under certain of our Credit Facilities or the Existing Ardagh Bonds may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The Parent Guarantor’s future indebtedness and the future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may also require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor of such repurchase. If a Change of Control Offer is made, neither the Issuers nor the Parent Guarantor can provide any assurance that they will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. If the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor fails to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the holders of the Notes the rights described under ‘‘—Events of Default.’’ 47 ----- Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the distribution of such funds or the prepayment of the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor were not able to prepay any indebtedness containing any such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the Issuers and the Parent Guarantor would be unable to fulfill their repurchase obligations to holders of Notes who exercise their right to redeem their Notes following a Change of Control, which would cause a Default under the Indenture. A Default under the Indenture, unless waived by holders, would result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’ Neither the Issuers nor the Parent Guarantor will be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the provisions of the Indenture will not give holders the right to require the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor to repurchase the Notes in the event of certain highly leveraged transactions, or certain other transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction and, in certain circumstances, an acquisition by the Parent Guarantor’s management or its Affiliates, that may adversely affect holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt.’’ The existence of a holder of the Notes’ right to require the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor to repurchase such holder’s Notes upon a Change of Control may deter a third party from acquiring the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries in a transaction which constitutes a Change of Control.

After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, Regulation S Book-entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-entry Interest without compliance with these certification requirements. Rule 144A Book-entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act). In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Notes and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes. Any Book-entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-entry Interest.",N/A,as_expected,2020,152

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the registrar or transfer agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; _provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than $200,000, will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the applicable series of Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the applicable series of Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the applicable series of Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the applicable Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the applicable Indenture and the applicable series of Notes. 104 ----- If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the registrar or at the office of the transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an authentication order, will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. Either Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect us, the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by either Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, such Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations such as the Initial Purchaser. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and clearing corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Note only through DTC participants.

The rules applicable in order to calculate this tax are generally the same as those applicable to a regular trading company except in relation to certain payments of interest. Interest on the Notes would be deductible for Irish tax purposes, where certain conditions are met. All expenses that are not capital in nature and are wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the Irish Issuer’s activities and are not specifically prohibited by statute will be deductible from income in order to determine taxable profits.

Under Section 64 of the TCA 1997 no withholding for or on account of Irish income tax will be required to be made on interest arising on quoted Eurobonds provided they meet the following criteria: (a) they are held in a recognized clearing system, (b) the interest is paid by or through a person who is not in Ireland (‘‘non-Irish paying agent’’), or (c) the beneficial owner of the Notes is not resident in Ireland and has made all necessary declarations in the prescribed form.

In the case of persons that are individuals, interest will be liable to income tax at the marginal rate (up to 40%). Such income will also be liable to the Universal Social Charge at rates of up to 11% depending on the individual’s circumstances. Irish Pay Related Social Insurance contributions may also be payable. In the case of corporate entities, the rate of corporation tax applying to the interest income is 25% (unless the income constitutes trading income). Interest paid by an Irish resident company to persons resident outside Ireland and who are resident in a ‘‘relevant territory’’ is exempt from Irish income tax where the Notes constitute ‘‘quoted Eurobonds.’’ A ‘‘relevant territory’’ for this purpose is a Member State of the European Union (other than Ireland), or a territory with which Ireland has entered into a double tax treaty. Where interest is paid to or income, gains or discounts are realized by a person tax resident outside a relevant territory, such Irish source income may be chargeable to Irish income tax. However, a company (wherever resident) under the control of persons who are resident in a relevant territory and not under the control of Irish residents should not be liable to Irish tax on interest arising on quoted Eurobonds. A company (wherever resident) whose principal class of shares are quoted on a recognized stock exchange is also not taxable on such interest on quoted Eurobonds. Ireland operates a self-assessment system in respect of income taxes, corporation taxes, social insurance and the universal social charge.

The Irish and U.S. governments signed an intergovernmental agreement (‘‘Irish IGA’’) on December 12, 2012. Under the Irish IGA, information about relevant U.S. investors will be provided on an annual basis by each Irish FI (unless the FI is exempted from the FATCA requirements) directly to the Irish Revenue Commissioners, who will then provide such information to the U.S. tax authorities. _CRS_ The Common Reporting Standard (‘‘CRS’’) requires participating jurisdictions to exchange certain information held by financial institutions regarding their non-resident customers. Over 100 jurisdictions, including Ireland, have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and the first data exchanges took place in September 2017. CRS does not impose any additional requirements to withhold tax on payments to investors. _Reporting Obligations under FATCA and the CRS_ A common feature of both FATCA and the CRS is that entities that are classified as ‘‘Financial Institutions’’ are required to identify their investors and in certain circumstances report information to their local tax authorities (for onward reporting to overseas tax authorities, in the case of CRS, and for onward reporting to the U.S. tax authorities, in the case of FATCA). The Irish Revenue Commissioners have issued regulations and guidance notes making compliance with the Irish provisions implementing CRS and FATCA mandatory. As a result, Irish entities that are classified as ‘‘Financial Institutions’’ in accordance with FATCA and CRS have obligations in respect of the Irish law implementing CRS and FATCA. On the basis that the Irish Issuer does not fall within the definition of ‘‘Financial Institution’’ for FATCA and CRS purposes, it should not have any reporting obligations under FATCA or CRS. However, there may be still FATCA or CRS reporting applicable to the Notes by persons other than the Irish Issuer but this will be dependent upon various factors such as the entities from which the Noteholders will directly receive interest on the Notes, the rules applicable in the jurisdictions of these entities, where the ultimate beneficial owners of the Notes are resident and their FATCA and CRS status.",N/A,as_expected,2020,152

However, a registration duty may be due in case where (i) any document in relation to the Notes amongst other issue or transfer agreement, is either enclosed (annex´e) to a deed subject to a mandatory registration in Luxembourg (e.g., public deed) or lodged with a notary’s records (d´epos´e au rang des _minutes d’un notaire), or (ii) a registration of the Notes or any document in relation therewith (e.g., issue or_ transfer agreement) is made on a voluntary basis. Depending on the nature of the documents, an ad valorem or a fixed registration duty may be due. Generally, under the current Luxembourg administrative practice, no ad valorem registration duties are levied on the transfer of a bond or any other negotiable security (excluding a transfer of interest in a partnership holding Luxembourg real estate property). In the event the Notes are presented voluntarily or mandatorily to a Luxembourg Court or to an ‘autorit´e constitu´ee’, registration may be required, which is subject to registration duty on the document. Depending on the nature of the documents, the registration of the Notes would be subject to an ad valorem registration duty of 0.24 per cent, calculated on the amounts mentioned therein. If the Notes are annexed or referred to in a deed signed before a Luxembourg notary public that will be registered, the Luxembourg authorities may decide to levy the 0.24 per cent duty if the conditions to levy the duty are fulfilled.

Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding would apply no earlier than two years after issuance of final regulations by the IRS defining the term ‘‘foreign passthru payment’’. A foreign financial institution resident in an IGA jurisdiction must comply with specific due diligence procedures to identify its account holders and provide the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (directly or indirectly through its local tax authority) with information on financial accounts held by U.S. persons and recalcitrant account holders. Consequently, holders of the Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications to any financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made.

In particular, the summary does not take account of the application of any double taxation treaty that may apply in any given situation.

However, the clearing systems require us to designate only one Issuer for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes, and we intend to designate Ardagh Holdings USA as the issuer of the Notes for this purpose. As such, an applicable withholding agent likely will treat all interest payments on the Notes as U.S. source for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,152

United States Federal Income Taxation,557.3.2,U.S. Holders,"_Payments of Stated Interest_ Stated interest paid on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For most U.S. Holders, interest income with respect to the Notes will constitute ‘‘passive category’’ income, which may be relevant in calculating the U.S. Holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances. _Disposition of the Notes_ Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such disposition (except to the extent any amount realized is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which is taxable as described under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will be the cost at which the U.S. Holder acquires such Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will include the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any other property received for such Note. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of a Note will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year at the time of its disposition. For certain non-corporate holders (including individuals), any such long-term capital gain is subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. _Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_ Certain U.S. Holders may be required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for notes held in accounts maintained by certain U.S. financial institutions). U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, of this 115 ----- legislation on their ownership and disposition of the Notes including the significant penalties for non-compliance with this requirement. _Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_ In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments to U.S. Holders of interest on the Notes and to the proceeds of a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note. Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) may be required on such amounts if the U.S. Holder fails (i) to furnish the U.S. Holder’s taxpayer identification number, (ii) to certify that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding as a result of a prior failure to report interest or dividends or (iii) to otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain exempt U.S. Holders (including, among others, corporations) are not subject to the backup withholding and information reporting requirements. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, _provided that the required information is timely furnished to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’).",N/A,as_expected,2020,152

United States Federal Income Taxation,557.3.3,Non-U.S. Holders,"_Payments of Stated Interest_ As discussed above under ‘‘—Source of Interest Payments,’’ an applicable withholding agent likely will treat all payments on the Notes as U.S. source. Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, to the extent that payments of interest on the Notes are treated as paid from U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes, neither U.S. federal income tax nor the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax on U.S. source interest will apply to any payment of interest on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder provided that: - interest paid on a Note is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; - the Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Ardagh Holdings USA’s stock that are entitled to vote within the meaning of section 871(h)(3) of the Code; - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank whose receipt of interest on a Note is described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to Ardagh Holdings USA (actually or constructively) through stock ownership; and - (1) the Non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address, and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S. person (which certification may be made on an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other applicable form) or (2) the Non-U.S. Holder holds the Note through certain foreign intermediaries or certain foreign partnerships, and the Non-U.S. Holder and the foreign intermediary or foreign partnership satisfies the certification requirements of applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest (to the extent treated as paid from U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will be subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides us with a properly executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or 116 ----- other applicable form) stating that interest paid on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, then, although the Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax (provided the requirement to deliver an IRS Form W-8ECI, or other appropriate IRS Form W-8, is satisfied), the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis generally in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if a Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, it may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lesser rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the portion of its earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to adjustments, that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States. _Disposition of the Notes_ Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or U.S. federal withholding tax on any gain recognized unless: (1) that gain is effectively connected with a Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or (2) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition and certain other conditions are met. If a Non-U.S. Holder is described in clause (1) above, it will be subject to tax on the net gain derived from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (and possible branch profits tax) in generally the same manner as discussed above with respect to effectively connected interest. If a Non-U.S. Holder is an individual described in clause (2) above, such holder will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise). _Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_ Generally, the amount of U.S. source interest paid to Non-U.S. Holders and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments must be reported annually to the IRS and to Non-U.S. Holders. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest and withholding also may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to payments of interest on the Notes, provided the statement described above in the last bullet point under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’ has been received and we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person, as defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient. In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding with respect to payments of the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless the statement described above has been received, and we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that a holder is a U.S. person, as defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient, or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a Non-U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S. 117 ----- Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",N/A,as_expected,2020,152

This summary applies only to holders who purchase Notes for cash in this offering at the applicable price indicated on the cover of this Offering Memorandum and who will hold such notes as capital assets. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes. In particular, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that may be subject to special tax rules including, without limitation, the following: (i) banks or other financial institutions; (ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in securities; (iv) tax-exempt entities; (v) persons who will hold a Note as part of a ‘‘hedging’’ or ‘‘conversion’’ transaction or as a position in a ‘‘straddle’’ or as part of a ‘‘synthetic security’’ or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (vi) U.S. Holders (as defined below) who have a ‘‘functional currency’’ other than the U.S. 113 ----- dollar; (vii) regulated investment companies; (viii) partnerships and other pass-through entities (and investors therein); (ix) persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States; (x) U.S. Holders who hold Notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary; and (xi) persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an ‘‘applicable financial statement’’ (as defined in Section 451 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’)). Further, this summary does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences (such as, U.S. federal estate and gift tax consequences, or the Medicare tax on certain investment income) or any U.S. state and local or foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of the Notes. This summary is based on the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. All of the foregoing are subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below. For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996 and has properly elected to continue to be treated as a U.S. person. For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘Non-U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership (or other entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds a Note, the tax treatment of a partner in or owner of the partnership or other pass-through entity will generally depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the activities of the entity. A person that is a partner in a partnership or other pass-through entity that is considering investing in a Note should consult its own tax adviser. Each prospective investor should consult its own tax adviser with respect to the U.S. federal (including income, Medicare, estate and gift), state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of a Note. Holders should also review the discussion under ‘‘—Ireland Taxation’’ for the Irish tax consequences to a holder of the ownership of the Notes. In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated principal on a Note or retire the Notes before their stated maturity dates, see for instance ‘‘Description of the Notes— Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control.’’ Notwithstanding these possibilities, we do not believe that the Notes are contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and, consequently, we do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments. If, notwithstanding our view, the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally would be required to accrue ordinary income at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate on the Notes and to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion assumes that the Notes will be issued with no more than a _de minimis amount of original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This will be the case if the excess, if any, of the stated principal amount of the Notes over the issue price of the Notes is less than .25% of the 114 ----- stated principal amount of the Notes, multiplied by the number of complete years from the issue date to maturity of the Notes. U.S. Holders of Notes issued with more than a de minimis amount of OID generally will be required to include such OID in income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of any cash attributable to such OID, regardless of their regular method of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchaser for its own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. It may also cause the price of the Notes, as applicable, to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions.

Upon issuance, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and on or prior to the date required by the Indenture, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Parent Guarantor and most of the Subsidiary Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of one of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and such Guarantors live outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Ardagh Packaging Finance and the Guarantors (other than the Subsidiary Guarantors in Delaware (United States)), and substantially all of the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. In addition, local counsel have informed us that it is questionable whether a foreign court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against any Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. We have been advised by counsel that there is doubt that a lawsuit based upon United States federal or state securities laws could be brought in an original action in such foreign jurisdictions and that a foreign judgment based upon United States federal or state securities laws would be enforced in such jurisdictions. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not based on United States federal or state securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in such countries. You should consult with your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.
