The Co-Issuers may redeem the Notes in whole or in part on or after July 15, 2022 at the redemption
prices specified herein. Prior to July 15, 2022 we may also redeem the Notes by paying a ‘‘make-whole’’

approved by the Irish Stock Exchange and for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Irish Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market. There is no assurance that the Notes will
be listed and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange.

#### Investing in the Notes involves risks. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ beginning on page 11.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Securities Act’’), or any state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes are

the U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’) and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in accordance with

hereby notified that the seller of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the registration
requirements under the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.

This Offering Memorandum includes:

  - the unaudited condensed combined pro forma income statement information for the year ended
December 31, 2016 for Ardagh Group S.A. that gives effect to the Transactions as more fully
described in ‘‘Unaudited Condensed Combined Pro Forma Financial Information’’ as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2016; and

  - the unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2017 that gives effect to the Balance
Sheet Transactions as more fully described in ‘‘Unaudited Condensed Combined Pro Forma
Financial Information’’ as if they had occurred on March 31, 2017 (collectively, the ‘‘Pro Forma
Financial Information’’).

The financial statements of Ardagh Group S.A. as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016
and for the three years ended December 31, 2016 incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS in effect as of December 31, 2016. The
interim financial information of Ardagh Group S.A. as of and for the three months ended March 31,
2017 also incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance
with IFRS in effect as of March 31, 2017. The Rexam Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements and the Rexam Interim Combined Carve-out Financial Statements incorporated by
reference in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS in effect as of
December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The Ball Audited Annual Combined Financial
Statements and the Ball Interim Combined Financial Statements incorporated by reference in this
Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in effect as of
December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively. In making an investment decision, you must rely
upon your own examination of Ardagh, the terms of the offering of the Notes and the financial
information contained as incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult
your own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP
and how those differences could affect the financial information contained as incorporated by reference
in this Offering Memorandum.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS and U.S. GAAP requires the use
of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the
process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity,
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are
disclosed in the financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements for Ardagh Group S.A. have been prepared based on a
calendar year and are presented in euro rounded to the nearest million. The Ball Combined Financial
Statements have been prepared based on a calendar year and are presented in U.S. dollars rounded to
the nearest million. The Rexam Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements have been prepared based
on a calendar year and are presented in pounds sterling rounded to the nearest million. Therefore,
discrepancies in the tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may occur due to such
rounding.

Unless stated otherwise, debt balances are presented before deducting deferred financing costs.

**Ball Combined Financial Statements**

The Ball Combined Financial Statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows of certain metal beverage packaging operations of Ball Corporation in conformity with
U.S. GAAP. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts among the carve-out operations
have been eliminated. The Ball Combined Financial Statements may not be indicative of the future
performance of those operations and may not reflect what the combined results of operations, financial
position and cash flows would have been had those operations operated as an independent company

xiii


-----

during all of the periods presented in part because the metal beverage packaging operations of Ball
Corporation reflected in the Ball Combined Financial Statements include certain assets and certain
liabilities (namely, certain pension liabilities) that were retained by Ball Corporation and therefore do
not comprise part of the Ball Carve-Out Business acquired by us in the Beverage Can Acquisition.

For a further description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Ball Audited
Annual Combined Financial Statements, see Note 1 ‘‘Description of Business and Basis of
Presentation’’ and Note 2 ‘‘Critical and Significant Accounting Policies’’ to the Ball Audited Annual
Combined Financial Statements incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum.

**Rexam Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements**

The Rexam Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements reflect certain wholly-owned beverage can
operations of Rexam PLC that have not in the past formed a separate accounting group. These
businesses do not constitute a separate legal group. The Rexam Audited Annual Combined Carve-Out
Financial Statements have been prepared specifically for the purpose of facilitating the divestment of
the Rexam Carve-Out Business and on a basis that combines the results and assets and liabilities of
each of the manufacturing plants, warehouses and operations constituting the Rexam Carve-Out
Business by applying the principles underlying the consolidation procedures of IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated
_Financial Statements’. The Rexam Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements have been prepared on a_
carve-out basis in accordance with IFRS from the consolidated financial statements of Rexam PLC and
include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that management of Rexam PLC has determined
are attributable to the Rexam Carve-Out Business.

For a further description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Rexam Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements, please see Note 1 ‘‘Nature of operations and basis of presentation’’
and Note 3 ‘‘Principal accounting policies’’ to the Rexam Audited Annual Combined Carve-Out
Financial Statements incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. This basis of
preparation sets out the method used in identifying the financial position, performance and cash flows
in relation to each of the plants that has been included in Rexam Combined Carve-Out Financial
Statements. These notes explain that the businesses included in the Rexam Combined Carve-Out
Financial Statements have not operated as a single entity. The Rexam Combined Carve-Out Financial
Statements are, therefore, not necessarily indicative of results that would have occurred if the Rexam
Carve-Out Business had operated as a single business during the periods presented or of future results
of the Rexam Carve-Out Business.

**Pro Forma Financial Information**

Under IFRS 3, Revised ‘‘Business Combinations,’’ all business combinations should be accounted
for by applying the purchase method of accounting. This involves measuring the cost of the business
combination and allocating, at the acquisition date, the cost of the business combination to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information in respect of the acquisition of the
Beverage Can Business is provisional and will differ from the final acquisition accounting for a number
of reasons, including the fact that the estimates of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are
provisional and subject to change when the formal valuations and other studies are finalized. The
differences that will occur between the provisional estimates and the final acquisition accounting could
have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma combined financial information, including the
impact on pro forma amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and
equipment. The differences that will occur between the provisional estimates and the final acquisition
accounting could have a material impact on pro forma combined financial information.

xiv


-----

The unaudited pro forma income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2016
gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016.

This unaudited pro forma financial information is based on available information and various
assumptions that management believe to be reasonable. The actual results may differ significantly from
those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information for a number of reasons, including,
but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma
combined financial information and actual amounts. The unaudited pro forma financial information is
provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated
results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it
necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial position.

The historical income statement of Ardagh Group S.A. and its subsidiaries for the year ended
December 31, 2016 includes the results of both the Ball Carve-Out Business and the Rexam Carve-Out
Business for the post acquisition period from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016.

The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects a number of adjustments made to the
financial information of the Ball Carve-Out Business and the Rexam Carve-Out Business. The
compilation of the unaudited pro forma financial information and the adjustments reflected therein are
explained as follows:

  - Adjustments have been made to the Ball Combined Financial Statements to eliminate the results
of operations and assets and liabilities associated with certain assets (namely, three plants in
Europe and certain other ancillary assets) and certain liabilities (namely, certain pension
liabilities) that were retained by Ball Corporation and therefore do not comprise part of the Ball
Carve-Out Business acquired by us in the Beverage Can Acquisition. The income statement data
has been adjusted generally (i) in the case of revenue on the basis of actual sales of the various
plants and (ii) in the case of cost items on the basis of allocations, including, for example, on
relative sales volumes.

  - Adjustments have been made to convert the underlying U.S. GAAP financial information set
forth in the Ball Combined Financial Statements to IFRS and in alignment with the IFRS
accounting policies of Ardagh. These adjustments are based on management’s analysis of the
major GAAP and accounting policy differences between Ardagh and the Ball Combined
Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that a full IFRS conversion of the financial
information set forth in the Ball Combined Financial Statements to IFRS would not result in
different numbers, and such differences may be material.

  - The underlying financial information of both the Ball Carve-Out Business and the Rexam
Carve-Out Business has been adjusted to align the presentation of certain income statement
items with the presentation of such financial information in the financial statements of Ardagh.
However, the underlying financial information of the Ball Carve-Out Business and the Rexam
Carve-Out Business has not been adjusted to fully align the classification of certain income
statement items with their treatment in the financial information of Ardagh. Further, an exercise
will need to be performed to align the accounting policies of the Ball Carve-Out Business and
the Rexam Carve-Out Business with those of Ardagh under IFRS. Adjustments arising from this
exercise could also be material.

The basis for the adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information and the
key assumptions made are explained in the notes to the information accompanying the tables.

The financial information of the Ball Carve-Out Business has been translated by Ardagh from U.S.
dollars into euros, and the financial information of the Rexam Carve-Out Business has been translated
from pounds sterling into euros. For all income statement items an average rate for the period
presented has been used. Based on its review of the historical financial information and understanding

xv


-----

of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, Ardagh is not aware of any further material
adjustment that it would need to make to the Ball Carve-Out Business’s historical financial information
or the Rexam Carve-Out Business’s historical financial information relating to foreign currency
translation.

The summary pro forma financial information set forth below may not be fully compliant with the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
‘‘Exchange Act’’) or U.S. GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial
information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(United Kingdom and Ireland) or auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). The summary unaudited pro forma combined financial and other data set forth
below should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto of Ardagh and the Ball Combined Financial Statements and the Rexam Combined Carve-Out
Financial Statements, incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum and ‘‘Operating and
Financial Review and Prospects.’’

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

We present in this Offering Memorandum Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and
related ratios, which are supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity that are not required
by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS and, in relation to the Ball Carve-Out Business, U.S. GAAP.
We define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’ as operating profit before depreciation, amortization, non-exceptional
impairment and exceptional operating items, and ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA margin’’ as Adjusted EBITDA
divided by revenue. In this Offering Memorandum, we present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
margin and related ratios for Ardagh Group S.A. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and related ratios should not be considered in
isolation and are not measures of our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be
considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period or any other performance measures derived
in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing or financing
activities as a measure of our liquidity as derived in accordance with IFRS. These non-GAAP financial
measures do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash
requirements and may not be indicative of our results of operations. In addition, such measures as we
define them may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

**Industry and Market Data**

**_Metal Packaging_**

Given the specialized nature of the metal packaging markets in which Metal Packaging operates,
there does not exist a relevant and reliable third-party source of much of the relevant market
information incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. Therefore, estimates provided by
Metal Packaging regarding these markets, as well as estimated market shares of Metal Packaging or its
competitors, are largely based on Metal Packaging’s knowledge of these markets, developed primarily
from analysis of public information, third-party reports to the extent available, competitors’ public
announcements and regulatory filings and information gathered in the course of acquisitions. The data
relating to market sizes, market share and market position are based on the most recent data available.
This information has not been confirmed by an independent organization, nor can there be assurance
that third parties would arrive at the same results were they to employ different methods for gathering,
analyzing and calculating such data. Breakdowns of market shares were established on the basis of
Metal Packaging’s consolidated revenues and these data. Market positions and percentage shares are
those that Metal Packaging believes it holds in terms of revenues. They are based on industry market
sectors on which Metal Packaging’s group business is arranged.

xvi


-----

Certain additional information regarding the global packaging industry, generally, and the metal
can packaging sector, specifically, has been sourced from Smithers Pira.

Any third-party information described above and incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum has been accurately reproduced and as far as we are aware and are able to ascertain
from the information published by such third parties, the reproduced information is accurate and no
facts have been omitted which would render such information inaccurate or misleading. Market share
data is subject to change, however, and such third-party information has been prepared for statistical
and other informational purposes, which is limited by the availability and reliability of raw data, the
voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any
statistical survey of market share.

**_Glass Packaging_**

We have used industry and market data obtained from independent industry publications, market
research, internal surveys and other publicly available information. In particular, we have obtained
information or other statements incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum relating to
market share and industry data relating to our business from providers of industry data, including the
British Glass Manufacturers Confederation, Fachvereinigung Beh¨alterglasindustrie e.V. (Germany),
Forum Opakowan Szklanych (Poland) and the European Container Glass Federation (‘‘FEVE’’).

Industry publications generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from
sources believed to be reliable but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not
guaranteed. We have not independently verified such data. Similarly, while we believe that our internal
surveys are reliable, they have not been verified by independent sources and we cannot assure you of
their accuracy.

Moreover, information and quantitative statements regarding our market position relative to our
competitors are not based on published statistical data or information obtained from third parties.
Rather, such information and statements reflect our best estimates based upon our internal records and
surveys, statistics published by providers of industry data, information published by our competitors,
and information obtained from trade and business organizations and associations and other sources
within the industry in which we operate. We believe that such data are useful in helping investors
understand the industry in which we operate and our position within the industry. However, we do not
have access to the facts and assumptions underlying the numerical data and other information extracted
from publicly available sources and have not independently verified any data provided by third parties
or industry or general publications. In addition, while we believe our internal data and surveys to be
reliable, such data and surveys have not been verified by any independent sources.

We refer to ‘‘Northern Europe’’ to include collectively Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland,
Benelux and the Nordic region. We refer to the ‘‘Nordic region’’ to include collectively Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. We refer to ‘‘Benelux’’ to include collectively Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference herein) includes
statements that are, or may be deemed to be, ‘‘forward-looking statements’’ within the meaning of the
securities laws of certain jurisdictions, statements of future expectations and other forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology
such as ‘‘aim,’’ ‘‘anticipate,’’ ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘continue,’’ ‘‘could,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’ ‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘forecast,’’
‘‘guidance,’’ ‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘plan,’’ ‘‘potential,’’ ‘‘predict,’’ ‘‘projected,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘suggests,’’
‘‘targets,’’ ‘‘will’’ or ‘‘would’’ or similar expressions or the negatives thereof, or other variations thereof,
or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. These forward-looking
statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places
throughout this Offering Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference herein) and
include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, amongst other
things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the
industry in which we operate.

We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that
our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry
in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking
statements contained in this Offering Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference
herein). In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the
development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this Offering Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference herein),
those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in
the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The development of the industry in which we
operate, may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the
forward-looking statements contained (or incorporated by reference) in this Offering Memorandum.

These statements are based on management’s current views and assumptions and involve known
and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ
materially from those anticipated by such statements. Factors that could cause such differences in actual

**EXCHANGE RATES**

The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a ‘‘best market’’ calculation. At any point in time, the bid rate
is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications, while the ask rate is set to the
lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between
the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate.

The average rate for a year means the average of the closing Bloomberg Composite Rate on each
business day during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average
of the closing Bloomberg Composite Rate of each business day during that month, or during any
shorter period, as the case may be.

Unless otherwise specified herein, all U.S. dollar amounts have been translated into euro at an
exchange rate of A1.00 = $1.0691, the exchange rate used in preparing Ardagh’s balance sheet on
March 31, 2017.

(5) Net debt is comprised of total borrowings and derivative financial instruments used to hedge foreign currency and interest
rate risk, net of cash and cash equivalents.

(6) To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following additional financial
measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.
We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial
performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating
performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business.
We use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to
that of our competitors.

Adjusted EBITDA consists of (loss)/profit before tax, net finance expense, depreciation and amortization and exceptional
operating items. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin are presented because we believe that they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors
and other interested parties in evaluating companies in the packaging industry. However, other companies may calculate
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in a manner different from ours. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative
to profit/(loss) as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with
IFRS.

The reconciliation of (loss)/profit before tax for the year to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

(7) Depreciation, amortization, and impairment of property, plant and equipment.

(8) Capital expenditure is the sum of purchase of property, plant and equipment and software and other intangibles, net of
proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment.

(9) Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 consists of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2016 plus (a) Adjusted EBITDA of Ardagh Group S.A. for the three months ended
March 31, 2017, less (b) pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of Ardagh Group S.A. for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
For a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA of Ardagh Group S.A. for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 see
footnote 6 above. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of Ardagh Group S.A. for the three months ended March 31, 2016 has
been derived by adding the estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the Beverage Can Business for the three months ended
March 31, 2016 to the historical Adjusted EBITDA for Ardagh Group S.A. for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA of the Beverage Can Business for the three months ended March 31, 2016 has been prepared by

-----

allocating Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2016 between the three months ended March 31, 2016 and
the three months ended June 30, 2016 based on estimated quarterly volumes and other available information as estimated
and deemed appropriate by management. Neither the volumes nor the Adjusted EBITDA have been audited or reviewed.
These results are for illustrative purposes only and have not been subject to audit or review.

(10) Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 is calculated as pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA divided by pro forma revenue, in each case for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017. Pro forma revenue for
the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 consists of pro forma revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016
plus (a) revenue of Ardagh Group S.A. for the three months ended March 31, 2017, less (b) pro forma revenue of Ardagh
Group S.A. for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Pro forma revenue of Ardagh Group S.A. for the three months
ended March 31, 2017 has been derived in a manner consistent with the corresponding Adjusted EBITDA. See footnote 9
above.

(11) The ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to net interest expense is calculated based on pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2017 and pro forma net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. While the
company estimates that pro forma net interest expense for the twelve months year ended December 31, 2016 would be
substantially consistent with pro forma net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, there can be no
assurance that pro forma net interest expense for the twelve months year ended December 31, 2016 represents what net
interest expense would have been if the Transactions had occurred on April 1, 2016.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following_
_risks, together with other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether to_
_invest in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could materially adversely affect_
_our business, financial condition or results of operations. If these events occur, the trading prices of the_
_Notes could decline, and we may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and_
_you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now_
_deem immaterial may also harm us and affect your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements._
_Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’_

**Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_Certain of our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling_**
**_our obligations under the Notes._**

We have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. As of March 31,
2017, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the offering, we would have had (i) total debt of
A7,572 million, of which A468 million would have been debt incurred in this offering and
(ii) A7,104 million of debt which will mature prior to the maturity of the Notes. As of March 31, 2017,
we had additional availability under our main credit facilities of up to A264 million, and all of these
borrowings would effectively rank senior to the Notes.

Our substantial debt could have important negative consequences for us and for you as a holder of
the Notes. For example, our substantial debt could:

   - require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund
repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working
capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

   - increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;

   - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in
which we operate;

   - limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future;

   - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

   - make it difficult for us to pay interest or principal on the Notes and our other debt; and

  - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

In addition, a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing
market interest rates. Although we may hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates by
entering into interest rate swaps, we cannot assure you that we will do so in the future. As a result, an
increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations,
which would exacerbate the risks associated with our leveraged capital structure.

Negative developments in our business, results of operations and financial condition due to the
current difficult global economic conditions or other factors could cause the ratings agencies to lower
the credit ratings, or ratings outlook, of our short- and long-term debt and, consequently, impair our
ability to raise new financing or refinance our current borrowings and increase our costs of issuing any
new debt instruments.

11


-----

**_Certain of our credit facilities contain financial covenants which we could fail to meet._**

Certain of our existing credit facilities require, and our future credit facilities may require, the
Parent Guarantor and certain of its subsidiaries to satisfy specified financial tests and maintain
specified financial ratios and covenants regarding a minimum level of EBITDA to net interest expense,
a minimum level of EBITDA to total debt, and a maximum amount of capital expenditures, all as
defined in such credit facilities. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’

The ability of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these ratios and to meet
these tests may be affected by events beyond their control and we cannot assure you that they will
continue to meet these tests. The failure of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with
these obligations could lead to a default under these credit facilities unless we can obtain waivers or
consents in respect of any breaches of these obligations under these credit facilities. We cannot assure
you that these waivers or consents will be granted. A breach of any of these covenants or the inability
to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under these credit facilities. In the
event of any default under these credit facilities, the lenders under these facilities will not be required
to lend any additional amounts to us or our operating subsidiaries and could elect to declare all
outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, fees and other amounts due thereunder, to be
immediately due and payable. In the event of a default, the relevant lenders (and, potentially, the
trustee under any of the Existing Notes or the Notes) could also require us to apply all available cash
to repay the borrowings or prevent us from making debt service payments on the Existing Notes and
the Notes, any of which would be an event of default under these notes. If the debt under our credit
facilities or the Existing Notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be
sufficient to repay such debt in full.

**_We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt._**

Subject to the restrictions in our credit facilities, the Indenture, the Existing Indentures and other
outstanding debt, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could also be
secured.

As of March 31, 2017, we had additional availability under our main credit facilities of up to
A264 million, and all of these borrowings would rank senior to the Subsidiary Guarantees. Although the
terms of these credit facilities, the Indenture and the Existing Indentures and other outstanding debt
contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of
significant qualifications and exceptions, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could
be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the substantial
leverage-related risks described above would increase.

**_Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to_**
**_generate cash required to service our debt._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on the Notes and to meet our other debt service
obligations or refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and
ability to generate cash. This will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business
strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, technical and other factors
beyond our control. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund
our other business needs, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt,
including the Notes, obtain additional financing, delay planned acquisitions or capital expenditures or
sell assets. There can be no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of
the foregoing. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets
on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect
to our debt, including the Notes.

12


-----

We expect to be able to repay or refinance the principal amounts outstanding under our
outstanding notes (including the Notes) upon maturity of each such series of notes between 2021 and
2027. We may, however, be unable to repay or refinance such principal amounts on terms satisfactory
to us or at all.

**_Restrictions imposed by the Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the HSBC Securitization Program, the_**
**_Bank of America Facility and certain of our other credit facilities limit our ability to take certain actions._**

The Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the HSBC Securitization Program and certain of our other
credit facilities limit our flexibility in operating our business. For example, these agreements restrict or
limit the ability of the Parent Guarantor and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - borrow money;

   - pay dividends or make other distributions;

   - create certain liens;

   - make certain asset dispositions;

  - make certain loans or investments;

   - issue or sell share capital of our subsidiaries;

  - guarantee indebtedness;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates; or

   - merge, consolidate or sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

There can be no assurances that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the
Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the HSBC Securitization Program and certain of our other credit
facilities will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage
in other business activities that may be in our interest. Any future indebtedness may include similar or
other restrictive terms. In addition, the management believes that the future expansion of our
packaging business is likely to require participation in the consolidation of the packaging industry by
the further acquisition of existing businesses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to participate in
such consolidation or that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the Indenture, the
Existing Indentures, the HSBC Securitization Program and certain of our other credit facilities will
permit us to do so.

In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, a breach of the covenants in the
Indenture could cause a default under the terms of our other financing agreements, including the
HSBC Securitization Program, causing all the debt under those agreements to be accelerated. If this
were to occur, we can make no assurances that we would have sufficient assets to repay our debt.

**_We may be unable to repurchase the Notes as required upon a Change of Control._**

If we experience a Change of Control, we would be required to make an offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date of repurchase. However, we may be unable to do so because we might not have enough available
funds, particularly since a Change of Control could in certain circumstances cause part or all of our
other debt to become due and payable.

See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control.’’

**_The insolvency laws of Ireland and other local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S._**
**_bankruptcy laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar._**

Ardagh Packaging Finance, one of the co-issuers of the Notes, is incorporated in Ireland, Ardagh
Holdings USA, one of the co-issuers of the Notes, is incorporated in the State of Delaware (United
States), and the Parent Guarantor is incorporated in Luxembourg. Most of the Subsidiary Guarantors
of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of a number of different jurisdictions. The insolvency
laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States
or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that the Co-Issuers, the Parent
Guarantor or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**_The Co-Issuers’ ability to pay principal and interest on the Notes may be affected by our organizational_**
**_structure. The Co-Issuers are dependent upon payments from other members of our corporate group to_**
**_fund payments to you on the Notes, and such other members might not be able to make such payments_**
**_in some circumstances._**

The Co-Issuers do not themselves conduct any business operations and do not have any assets or
sources of income of their own, other than the intercompany notes made to on-lend the net proceeds
from the offering of the Notes as described below. As a result, the Co-Issuers’ ability to make payments
on the Notes is dependent directly upon interest or other payments they receive from other members
of our corporate group. Initially, the proceeds of the Notes will be loaned to other members of our
corporate group pursuant to intercompany notes. These intercompany notes may be subordinated to
senior debt of the relevant intercompany borrowers. The Indenture does not require the maintenance
of these intercompany notes. Accordingly, you should only rely on the Guarantees of the Notes, and
not these intercompany notes, to provide credit support in respect of payments of principal or interest
on the Notes. The ability of other members of our corporate group to make payments to the
Co-Issuers will depend upon their cash flows and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the
factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors’’ or those Risk Factors incorporated by reference herein.

Furthermore, some of our credit facilities contain certain restrictions on the borrowers thereunder
from making certain distributions or payments of capital or income to their members. As a result, the
amounts that the Co-Issuers expect to receive from other members of our corporate group may not be
forthcoming or sufficient to enable the Co-Issuers to service their obligations on the Notes.

The Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. The Subsidiary
Guarantors are either intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries of the Parent
Guarantor.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees across multiple jurisdictions may_**
**_prove difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Co-Issuers, one of which is incorporated under the laws of Ireland
and the other of which is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (United States), and
will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor, which is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg.
Most of the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of a number of
different jurisdictions. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be
initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and
costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the
enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the
insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will

14


-----

be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Co-Issuers’ and the
Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each
other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of
governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the
proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether
any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under
the Notes and the Guarantees in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Subsidiary Guarantors are organized limit the
ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a sister company. See ‘‘—Corporate benefit, capital
maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and
enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes.’’

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against the independent accountants._**

See ‘‘Independent Accountants’’ for a description of the reports of the independent accountants of
the Rexam Carve-Out Business. The independent accountants’ reports state that they were made solely
to the directors, as a body, of the Rexam Carve-Out Business; and the independent accountants do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the directors, as a body, of the Rexam Carve-Out
Business for its audit work, for its reports or for the conclusions or opinions it has formed. The
independent accountants’ reports on the non-statutory combined financial statements of the Rexam
Carve-Out Business, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, were unqualified and are
incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was the auditor
of the Rexam Carve-Out Business for these accounting periods.

Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, the respective
independent accountant confirmed that it does not accept or assume any responsibility to parties (such
as the purchasers of the Notes) other than to the directors, as a body, of Ardagh with respect to their
reports and to the independent accountants’ audit work, conclusions and opinions. The SEC would not
permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in
connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act or in a report filed
under the Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting
language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent accountant based
on its report or the consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited.

**_An active trading market may not develop for the Notes._**

The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no existing market. Although application
will be made for listing particulars to be approved by the Irish Stock Exchange and for the Notes to be
admitted to the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on its Global
Exchange Market, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or will remain listed. We cannot
assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Notes, the ability of holders of
the Notes to sell them or the price at which the holders of the Notes may be able to sell them. The
liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes, prevailing
interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions
and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as recommendations by securities
analysts. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt, such as the Notes, has been subject to
disruptions that have caused substantial price volatility. There can be no assurances that if a market for
the Notes were to develop, such a market would not be subject to similar disruptions. We have been
informed by the Initial Purchasers that they intend to make a market for the Notes after the offering is

15


-----

completed. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so and may cease their marketmaking activity at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to
limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result,
we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or, if one does develop,
that it will be maintained.

**_The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer._**

The Notes have not been and, will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S.
state securities laws. You may not offer the Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption
from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. We have not
undertaken to register the Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the future.
Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other country’s securities laws. It is your
obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**_Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or
holders of Notes. The common depository (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream Banking will be the registered holder of the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A
Global Notes (as such terms are defined in ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form’’). After payment to the
common depository we, the Trustee, and the Principal Paying Agent will have no responsibility or
liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream Banking, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking, on the
procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations of a holder under the Indenture. See ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.’’

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you
have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking or, if
applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting
of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until
definitive registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking. We, the
Trustee, and the Principal Paying Agent cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented
through Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights
under the Notes. See ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.’’

**_You may be unable to serve process on us or our directors and officers in the United States and enforce_**
**_U.S. judgments based on the Notes._**

Ardagh Packaging Finance, one of the Co-Issuers of the Notes, is incorporated under the laws of
Ireland, and the Parent Guarantor of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Most of
the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of a number of different
jurisdictions. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of the Co-Issuers and such
Guarantors live outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Ardagh Packaging Finance

16


-----

and the Guarantors (other than the Subsidiary Guarantors in Delaware (United States)), and
substantially all of the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United
States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons in the United States
or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of
the securities laws of the United States.

In addition, local counsel have informed us that it is questionable whether a foreign court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. See
‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.’’

**_Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect_**
**_the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes._**

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Subsidiary Guarantors are organized limit the
ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a related company. These limitations arise under
various provisions or principles of corporate law which include rules governing capital maintenance,
under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee need to be reasonable and
economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s perspective, as well as thin capitalization,
unfair consideration, financial assistance, corporate purpose or similar law affecting the rights of
creditors generally, and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations were not observed, the
Guarantees could be subject to legal challenge. In some jurisdictions, the Guarantees will contain
language limiting the amount of debt guaranteed so that applicable local law restrictions will not be
violated. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Subsidiary Guarantees by a Subsidiary Guarantor in
one of these jurisdictions, your claims are likely to be limited. In some cases, where the amount that
can be guaranteed is limited by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the Subsidiary
Guarantor or by reference to the outstanding debt owed by the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor to the
Co-Issuers under intercompany loans that amount might have reached zero or close to zero at the time
of any insolvency or enforcement. Furthermore, although we believe that the Guarantees by these
Subsidiary Guarantors will be validly given in accordance with local law restrictions, there can be no
assurance that a third-party creditor would not challenge these Subsidiary Guarantees and prevail in
court.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of an
insolvency event, the holders of senior debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in
full from the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such
Subsidiary Guarantor’s Subsidiary Guarantee. Until the senior debt of a Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in
full, any distribution to which holders of the Notes would be entitled but for the subordination
provisions shall instead be made to holders of senior debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor as their
interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Subsidiary Guarantor, holders of
senior debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of the Notes, in
respect of the Subsidiary Guarantor’s Subsidiary Guarantee in respect thereof.

In addition, the subordination provisions relating to the Subsidiary Guarantees will provide:

   - customary turnover provisions by the Trustee for the holders of the Notes and the holders of the
Notes for the benefit of the holders of senior debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

  - that if a payment default on any senior debt of a Subsidiary Guarantor has occurred and is
continuing, such Subsidiary Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Subsidiary
Guarantee until such default is cured or waived;

   - that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness that
permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such
default, such Subsidiary Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Notes, or

17


-----

pursuant to its Subsidiary Guarantee, until the earlier of the default is cured or waived or
179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and

   - that the holders of the Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the
applicable senior agent, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such Guarantee,
except in certain circumstances.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, holders of indebtedness
of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing
agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these
assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholders.

Accordingly, in the event that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates
or otherwise reorganizes:

   - the creditors of the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to
proceed against such subsidiary’s assets; and

   - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any
Guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from
such subsidiary.

As of March 31, 2017, on a historical basis, Ardagh’s non-guarantor subsidiaries had no debt
outstanding and A117 million of trade payables and deferred taxes, all of which would have ranked
structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_**
**_adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

Our obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. The Subsidiary Guarantors
of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of a number of different jurisdictions.

Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees, limitations on
the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of
the Guarantee against a Guarantor. The court or an insolvency administrator may also in certain
circumstances avoid the Guarantee where the company is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The
following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview,
describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s
fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed
insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and intercompany obligations generally, as
fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it
makes certain findings, to:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee;

  - direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security to
the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and

   - take other action that is detrimental to you.

18


-----

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee is found to be a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever
repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor
under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a
fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount
recoverable from the Guarantors will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what
standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. Also, there
is a possibility that the Guarantees may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished.

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles,
courts would need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued, the relevant Guarantor:

   - issued such Guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future
creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its
insolvency;

  - issued such Guarantee in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such
Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor; or

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the
Guarantee on the basis that the Guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the
Guarantor’s benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of
the issuance of the Guarantee or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was
engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were
unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability
to make required payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in
different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee if:

   - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

  - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; and/or

   - the present salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the offering of the
Notes, there can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a
Guarantor was ‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date the Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the method
of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court
would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee
was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

**_We do not present separate financial statements for each Subsidiary Guarantor._**

We have not presented in this Offering Memorandum separate financial statements for each
Subsidiary Guarantor, and we are not required to do so in the future under the Indenture.

**Additional Risks Relating to the Notes**

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be unsecured and the claims of secured creditors will have priority._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be unsecured obligations of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors,
respectively. Debt under the Existing Secured Notes and several of our facilities are secured by liens on

19


-----

the property and assets of material operating subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor, as well as shares
held by the Parent Guarantor or the Subsidiary Guarantors in their material operating subsidiaries. In
addition, subject to the restrictions in our senior secured credit facilities, in the indentures governing
our Existing Notes and in other outstanding debt, we may be able to incur substantial additional
secured debt. The secured creditors of the Guarantors will have priority over the assets securing their
debt to the extent of the value of such assets. In the event that any of such secured debt becomes due
or a secured lender proceeds against the assets that secure the debt, the assets would be available to
satisfy obligations under the secured debt before any payment would be made on the Notes or under
any of the Guarantees. Any assets remaining after repayment of our secured debt may not be sufficient
to repay all amounts owing under the Notes.

**_The right of holders of Notes to receive payment under the Guarantees is contractually subordinated to_**
**_senior debt._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor (other than the
Parent Guarantor) under the Guarantees will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full in cash of all obligations in respect of senior debt of such Guarantor (other than
the Parent Guarantor). This senior debt includes, in respect of a Guarantor that is a guarantor of the
Existing Secured Notes and certain credit facilities, such Guarantor’s obligations thereunder and under
its hedging arrangements. As of March 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the
Transactions, all of the Guarantors (other than the Parent Guarantor) would have had outstanding
A2,801 million of senior debt, which would rank senior in right of payment to the Guarantees. See
‘‘Capitalization.’’ Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to
incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and senior to the Guarantees.
For a complete summary of the terms of, and subordination provisions relating to, the Notes and the
Guarantees, see ‘‘Description of the Notes—Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees; Subordination.’’

**_You will not have the benefit of the guarantees from any of the Subsidiary Guarantors on the Issue Date._**

The Guarantees, other than the Parent Guarantee by the Parent Guarantor, may not be in effect
until 90 days following the issue date with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantees by the Subsidiary
Guarantors that at the time guarantee the Existing Secured Notes.

**_The dual class structure of the common shares of Ardagh Group S.A. has the effect of concentrating_**
**_voting control with the parent company of Ardagh Group S.A., limiting other shareholders’ ability to_**
**_influence corporate matters and could result in corporate actions that do not necessarily advance the_**
**_interests of creditors, including the holders of the Notes._**

ARD Holdings S.A. (‘‘ARD Holdings’’) owns directly or indirectly all Class B common shares of
Ardagh Group S.A. (which represent approximately 99.15% of the voting power of the issued and
outstanding share capital of Ardagh Group S.A. ARD Holdings will have the ability to control the
outcome of most matters requiring Ardagh Group S.A. shareholder approval. In exercising such
control, ARD Holdings may take actions in the interests of the shareholders as a whole that are not
necessarily consistent with the interests of creditors, including the holders of the Notes.

In addition, as a result of the issuance by ARD Finance S.A. of the Toggle Notes and the interest
service obligations thereof, we intend to pay dividends to our shareholders in amounts that will, at a
minimum, be sufficient to enable ARD Finance S.A. to satisfy the cash interest payment obligations
under the Toggle Notes. Our ability to pay such dividends is subject to compliance with applicable law,
any obligations imposed by applicable contracts and our articles of incorporation, including the
requirement that any dividends be approved by our shareholders. In order to preserve our ability to pay
such dividends, we have agreed that so long as the Toggle Notes are outstanding, we shall not, and

20


-----

shall not permit any member of the Ardagh Group to, agree to restrictions on the payment of
dividends that are materially more restrictive than the restrictions in place under any contract or
agreement existing on March 20, 2017 (the closing date of the Initial Public Offering).

We have established several committees, including an audit committee and a remuneration
committee, in order to ensure that the control exercised by our major shareholders is exercised through
appropriate corporate governance structures.

**_The results of the United Kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a_**
**_negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and demand for our business, which_**
**_could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

Structural stresses in the European Union have been a source of continuing global economic and
market uncertainty over several years. With a majority of the United Kingdom’s electorate having
voted, in a June 2016 referendum, for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union
(‘‘Brexit’’), and the official triggering by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, of the Brexit process
in March 2017, those uncertainties have become more pronounced.

The economic outlook could be further adversely affected by the risk that one or more European
Union member states could themselves come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union
as well, the risk of a greater push for independence by Scotland or Northern Ireland, or the risk that
the Euro as the single currency of any or all of the Eurozone member states could cease to exist. These
developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on
global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce
global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial
markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to
increased market volatility. If the United Kingdom and the European Union are unable to negotiate
acceptable withdrawal terms or if other EU member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access to the
markets between the United Kingdom and other EU member states or among the European economic
area overall could be diminished or eliminated.

Depending on the terms of Brexit, if any, the United Kingdom could also lose access to the single
EU market resulting in an impact on the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom.
Additionally, political instability in the European Union as a result of Brexit may result in a material
negative effect on credit markets and foreign direct investments in Europe. This deterioration in
economic conditions could result in increased unemployment rates, increased short- and long-term
interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, a decline in the strength of national and
local economies, and other results that negatively impact household incomes. These negative impacts
could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

**UNAUDITED CONDENSED COMBINED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Under IFRS 3, Revised ‘‘Business Combinations,’’ all business combinations should be accounted
for by applying the purchase method of accounting. This involves measuring the cost of the business
combination and allocating, at the acquisition date, the cost of the business combination to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information may not be fully compliant
with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the ‘‘Exchange Act’’) or U.S. GAAP. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information in
respect of the acquisition of the Ball Carve-Out Business and the Rexam Carve-Out Business
(collectively the ‘‘Beverage Can Business’’) is provisional. Under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, the
measurement period for finalization of business combination accounting extends to a maximum of one
year after the acquisition date. The identification and valuation of acquired assets and liabilities will be
finalized by no later than June 30, 2017. The differences that will occur between the provisional
estimates and the final acquisition accounting could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma
combined financial information, including the impact on pro forma amortization of intangible assets
and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. The differences that will occur between the
provisional estimates and the final acquisition accounting could have a material impact on pro forma
combined financial information.

The following unaudited pro forma income statement information for the year ended

This unaudited pro forma financial information is based on available information and various
assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The actual results may differ significantly from
those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information for a number of reasons, including,
but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma
combined financial information and actual amounts. The unaudited pro forma financial information is
provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated
results of operations would have been had the transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it
necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial position.

The Ardagh historical income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the result
of both the Ball Carve-Out Business and the Rexam Carve-Out Business for the post-acquisition period
from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The pro forma income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2016 has been adjusted to include the results of both the Ball Carve-Out Business and
the Rexam Carve-Out Business for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects a number of adjustments made to the
financial information of the Ball Carve-Out Business and the Rexam Carve-Out Business. The
compilation of the unaudited pro forma financial information and the adjustments reflected therein are
explained as follows:

  - Adjustments have been made to the Ball Combined Financial Statements to eliminate the results
of operations and assets and liabilities associated with certain assets (namely, three plants in
Europe and certain other ancillary assets) and certain liabilities (namely, certain pension
liabilities) that were retained by Ball Corporation and therefore do not comprise part of the Ball
Carve-Out Business acquired by Ardagh in the Beverage Can Acquisition. The income statement
data has been adjusted generally (i) in the case of revenue on the basis of actual sales of the
various plants and (ii) in the case of cost items on the basis of allocations, including, for
example, on relative sales volumes.

  - Adjustments have been made to convert the underlying U.S. GAAP financial information set
forth in the Ball Combined Financial Statements to IFRS and in alignment with the IFRS
accounting policies of Ardagh. These adjustments are based on management’s analysis of the
major GAAP and accounting policy differences between Ardagh and the Ball Combined
Financial Statements.

  - The underlying financial information of both the Ball Carve-Out Business and the Rexam
Carve-Out Business has been adjusted to align the presentation of certain income statement
items with the presentation of such financial information in the financial statements of Ardagh.

The basis for the adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information and the
key assumptions made are explained in the notes to the information accompanying the tables.

The financial information of the Ball Carve-Out Business has been translated by Ardagh from U.S.
dollars into euros, and the financial information of the Rexam Carve-Out Business has been translated
from pounds sterling into euros. For all income statement items an average rate for the period
presented has been used. Based on its review of the historical financial information and understanding
of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, Ardagh is not aware of any further material
adjustment that it would need to make to the Ball Carve-Out Business’s historical financial information
or the Rexam Carve-Out Business’s historical financial information relating to foreign currency
translation.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial and other data set forth below should be read in
conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Ardagh and the
Ball Combined Financial Statements and the Rexam Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements, and

**_January 2017 Senior Notes_**

In January 2017, the January 2017 Senior Notes were issued in an offering not subject to the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

The January 2017 Senior Notes are governed by an indenture between, inter alios, the Co-Issuers,
Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee for the holders, and the Guarantors.

that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; rank senior in right of payment to any and
all of the existing and future indebtedness of each Co-Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to
the Notes; and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of each Co-Issuer to the extent

At any time on or prior to February 15, 2020, the Co-Issuers may redeem any or all of the January
2017 Senior Notes at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus the
applicable ‘‘make-whole’’ redemption premium. On or after February 15, 2020, the Co-Issuers may
redeem any or all of the January 2017 Senior Notes initially at 104.500% of their principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date (excluded) with the premium declining after
that date.

If an event treated as a change of control occurs, then the Co-Issuers or Ardagh Group S.A. must
make an offer to repurchase the January 2017 Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash in an amount
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
purchase.

The January 2017 Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary covenants and events of
default.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The intercreditor agreement is between, among others, Ardagh Group S.A. and certain of its
subsidiaries, the security agents, and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, in its capacity as trustee for the
Existing Notes (the ‘‘Intercreditor Agreement’’).

The Intercreditor Agreement establishes the ranking among certain of the Group’s senior debt
obligations, including the Unicredit Working Capital and Performance Guarantee Credit Lines, the
Existing Secured Notes and certain hedging obligations. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides for the subordination, in right of payment and enforcement, of all intercompany debt to all of
the aforementioned senior debt and to the Existing Senior Notes and the Notes offered hereby and the
respective guarantees thereof. With respect to the ranking of the guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the senior guarantees by the guarantors of the Existing Secured Notes will
rank pari passu with each other and each guarantor’s obligations under other senior debt and certain
hedging obligations and will rank senior to each Subsidiary Guarantor’s senior subordinated guarantees
of the Existing Senior Notes and the Notes offered hereby. However, any claim by the holders of the
Existing Secured Notes, hedging counterparties, the holders of the Existing Senior Notes and the
holders of the Notes offered hereby have in respect of the Guarantee from Heye International GmbH
will be subordinated to any claim UniCredit Bank AG has under the Unicredit Working Capital and
Performance Guarantee Credit Lines.

**HSBC Securitization Program**

On March 1, 2012, Ardagh Receivables Finance Designated Activity Company (‘‘ARF’’) entered
into a trade receivables securitization program providing for secured loans of an amount of up to

39


-----

A150 million from Regency Assets Designated Activity Company, an issuer of asset-backed commercial
paper that is sponsored by HSBC Bank plc.

The HSBC Securitization Program is designed to be used as the primary committed revolving
credit facility for the Ardagh Group. The actual amount of permitted borrowings outstanding at any
particular time depends on ARF maintaining the required borrowing base of eligible receivables to
support such borrowings. The HSBC Securitization Program has been amended from time to time and
currently matures in December 2019. The aggregate available commitment of the facility under the
HSBC Securitization Program is for an amount up to A150 million.

Under the HSBC Securitization Program, all trade receivables originated by certain operating
subsidiaries of Ardagh Group S.A. who have acceded to the HSBC Securitization Program as sellers
are sold by those sellers to ARF unless ARF and HSBC have agreed that receivables owed by certain
debtors are excluded (for example, if those receivables are to be sold into a supply chain finance
program relating to that debtor). To the extent not financed by borrowings under the HSBC
Securitization Program, ARF finances the purchase of receivables from the operating subsidiaries by
using subordinated loans from Ardagh Group S.A. ARF has granted security under the HSBC
Securitization Program over all of its receivables and collection accounts.

The HSBC Securitization Program contains incurrence-type covenants that are substantially similar
to the covenants contained in our Existing Indentures. In addition, it contains certain other covenants
that are customary for programs of this nature.

**Bank of America Facility**

On April 11, 2014, Ardagh Glass Inc. entered into a $200 million asset-based revolving loan and
security agreement with Bank of America, N.A. The $200 million four-year facility, including a
$80 million letter of credit sub-limit, was put in place to support the working capital needs of our
North American glass business after the VNA Acquisition. It may be increased by $50 million with a
proportional increase in the letter of credit sub-facility if certain conditions are met. The Bank of
America Facility is secured by a first priority lien over inventory and accounts receivable of Ardagh
Glass Inc. Although it contains affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions on transactions and
related events of default, it does not contain any maintenance covenants other than a minimum
collateral requirement.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The definitions of certain terms used in this description are set forth under the subheading
‘‘—Certain Definitions.’’ In this ‘‘Description of the Notes,’’ the term ‘‘Ardagh Holdings USA’’ refers
only to Ardagh Holdings USA Inc., a Delaware corporation, the term ‘‘Ardagh Packaging Finance’’
refers only to Ardagh Packaging Finance plc, the term ‘‘Issuers’’ refers only to Ardagh Holdings USA
and Ardagh Packaging Finance collectively, and the term ‘‘Parent Guarantor’’ refers only to Ardagh
Group S.A. and not to any of its Subsidiaries, except for the purpose of financial data determined on a
consolidated or combined basis, as the case may be. In addition, the term ‘‘Subsidiary Guarantors’’
refers only to any Restricted Subsidiary that incurs a Guarantee and the term ‘‘Guarantors’’ refers to
the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors collectively. Each of the Issuers and each
Subsidiary Guarantor will be a direct or indirect Restricted Subsidiary. In this ‘‘Description of the
Notes’’ the word ‘‘Notes’’ refers to ‘‘book-entry interests’’ in the Notes, as defined herein.

The Issuers will issue and the Guarantors will guarantee £400,000,000 aggregate principal amount
of senior notes due 2027 under an indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’) among, _inter alios, the Issuers, the_
Guarantors, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee (in such capacity, the ‘‘Trustee’’), and certain
other agents thereto. The Indenture is not required to be nor will it be qualified under, or be subject
to, the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) of such Act.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Indenture. It does not,
however, restate the Indenture in its entirety, and where reference is made to particular provisions of
the Indenture, such provisions, including the definitions of certain terms, are qualified in their entirety
by reference to all of the provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. You should read the Indenture
because it contains additional information and because it and not this description defines your rights as
a holder of the Notes. A copy of the form of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement may be
obtained by requesting it from the Issuers at the address indicated under ‘‘Listing and General
Information.’’

The Issuers will make an application for the Notes to be listed on the Global Exchange Market of
the Irish Stock Exchange. The Issuers can provide no assurance that this application will be accepted.

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The Notes:

(a) will be each of the Issuers’ general and unsecured obligations;

(b) mature on July 15, 2027;

(c) will initially be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Parent Guarantor; and

(d) subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by
the Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (other than the Issuers) that guarantee the Existing
Ardagh Bonds within the periods and to the extent required by ‘‘—Post-Closing Matters’’
below.

**Post-Closing Matters**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent Guarantor shall be required to ensure that all
subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (other than the Issuers) that guarantee the Existing Ardagh Bonds
become Subsidiary Guarantors no later than 90 days following the Issue Date.

41


-----

**The Guarantees**

The Guarantors will jointly and severally guarantee the due and punctual payment of all amounts
payable under the Notes, including principal, premium, if any, and interest payable under the Notes.

The obligations of a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor to issue a Guarantee of the Notes, if
required by the Indenture, will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The obligations of each
Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor without resulting in its obligations under
its Guarantee being voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent transfer, or
under similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or the maximum amount otherwise
permitted by law. In particular, each Guarantee will be limited as required to comply with corporate
benefit, maintenance of capital and other laws applicable in the jurisdiction of the relevant Subsidiary
Guarantor. By virtue of these limitations, a Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee
could be significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Notes, or a Subsidiary Guarantor may
have effectively no obligations under its Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Debt, the
Notes and the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the
Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes.’’

Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee will be entitled to
contribution from any other Guarantor.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

All of the Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon shall
terminate and be discharged and be of no further force and effect) upon Legal Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance as described under ‘‘—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’ or if all
obligations under the Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, in each
case in accordance with the terms and conditions in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, a Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee (and the Guarantee, if any, of any Subsidiary of
such Subsidiary Guarantor) will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon shall
terminate and be discharged and be of no further force and effect):

(a) upon any sale or disposition of (i) Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor following which
such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or
after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary that
does not violate the covenant described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of
Certain Assets’’;

(b) in the event that all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor is sold or otherwise
disposed of pursuant to an enforcement of the security over the Capital Stock of such
Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) upon the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(d) in the circumstances set forth in the third paragraph of ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Consolidation,
Merger and Sale of Assets’’; and

(e) as described under the caption ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers.’’

42


-----

**Release of Ardagh Holdings USA’s Obligations**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, upon the sale or disposition directly or
indirectly of the Capital Stock of Ardagh Holdings USA pursuant to an enforcement by a Security
Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (and/or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and the indentures and/or agreements governing Senior Debt (a ‘‘Holdings USA
Disposition’’), the obligations of Ardagh Holdings USA under the Notes and the Indenture will be
automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon shall terminate and be discharged and be of
no further effect); provided that each other guarantee by Ardagh Holdings USA in respect of any
Credit Facility and any other capital markets debt of the Parent Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries has
been released (or is released simultaneously upon such Holdings USA Disposition). Upon a Holdings
USA Disposition, Ardagh Packaging Finance shall be the sole Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture, and the Notes and the Indenture will remain in full force and effect and any reference in
the Indenture, the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement (and/or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) to the ‘‘Issuers’’ or Ardagh Holdings USA shall be deemed to be references only to the
‘‘Issuer’’ or Ardagh Packaging Finance, mutatis mutandis.

The Parent Guarantor will publish a notice of a Holdings USA Disposition described in the
immediately preceding paragraph in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under
‘‘—Notices’’ and, so long as the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, notify such exchange of a
Holdings USA Disposition.

**Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees; Subordination**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

(a) will be each of the Issuers’ general and unsecured obligations;

(b) will rank senior in right of payment to any and all of each of the Issuers’ existing and future
indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

(c) will rank equally in right of payment with all of each of the Issuers’ existing and future
unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

(d) will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of the Parent
Guarantor’s subsidiaries that do not provide Guarantees; and

(e) will be effectively subordinated to all of each of the Issuers’ existing and future secured
indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.

**_The Parent Guarantor’s Guarantee_**

The Parent Guarantor’s Guarantee:

(a) will be the Parent Guarantor’s general unsecured obligation;

(b) will rank senior in right of payment to any and all of the Parent Guarantor’s existing and
future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee;

(c) will rank equally in right of payment with any and all of the Parent Guarantor’s existing and
future unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee;

(d) will be effectively subordinated to all of the Parent Guarantor’s existing and future secured
indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and

43


-----

(e) will not be subject to the restrictions on enforcement described below applicable to each
Subsidiary Guarantee.

**_The Subsidiary Guarantors’ Guarantees_**

Each Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee will:

(a) be such Guarantor’s general unsecured obligation;

(b) be subordinated in right of payment to any and all of such Subsidiary Guarantor’s existing and
future Senior Debt;

(c) rank equally in right of payment with any and all of such Subsidiary Guarantor’s existing and
future unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated and is not senior in right of payment
of its Guarantee;

(d) rank senior in right of payment to any and all of such Subsidiary Guarantor’s existing and
future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee; and

(e) be subject to the restrictions on enforcement described below.

At March 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Subsidiary
Guarantors would have had on a consolidated basis:

(a) total debt of A7,572 million;

(b) total debt that is senior in right of payment to the Subsidiary Guarantees of A2,801 million;
and

(c) A4,771 million of debt that would rank equally with the Subsidiary Guarantees.

In addition, on a historical basis, at March 31, 2017, Ardagh’s non-guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries had (i) no debt outstanding and (ii) aggregated trade payables and deferred taxes of
A117 million.

Not all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will likely be required to repay financial and trade creditors before distributing any assets
to the Issuers or a Guarantor.

Ardagh Packaging Finance is a finance subsidiary without operations and Ardagh Holdings USA is
a holding company with no independent operations. Therefore, each Issuer depends on the cash flow of
the Parent Guarantor’s operating Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the
Notes. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries.’’
However, under the circumstances described below under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ the Parent Guarantor will be permitted to
designate certain of its Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’ Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Parent Guarantor will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Debt that the Issuers,
the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, the amount of such additional Debt
could be substantial. The Indenture will permit all Senior Debt to be secured.

As a result of the enforcement standstills and the various subordination provisions described
below, in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any Subsidiary

44


-----

Guarantor, holders of Notes may recover less, ratably, than other creditors of the Subsidiary
Guarantors (including trade creditors).

**_Enforcement Standstills in Relation to the Subsidiary Guarantors’ Guarantees_**

The Indenture will provide that no Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee may become due, and that
neither the holders of the Notes nor the Trustee may take any Enforcement Action against a Subsidiary
Guarantor without the prior consent of the applicable Senior Agent or Senior Agents unless:

(a) certain insolvency or reorganization events have occurred in relation to such Subsidiary
Guarantor;

(b) the holders of Designated Senior Debt have taken any Enforcement Action in relation to such
Subsidiary Guarantor; or

(c) a default has occurred under the Notes; and

(i) the holders of the Notes or the Trustee has notified the applicable Senior Agents;

(ii) a period of not less than 90 days (in the case of a payment default) or 179 days (in the
case of a non-payment default) has passed from the date the applicable Senior Agents
were notified of the default (a ‘‘Standstill Period’’); and

(iii) at the end of the Standstill Period, the default is continuing and has not been waived by
the holders of the Notes.

**_Subordination on Insolvency_**

The Indenture will provide that, in the event of any distribution to the creditors of a Subsidiary
Guarantor:

(a) in a liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

(b) in an insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, composition, receivership, administration,
voluntary arrangement or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor or its
property;

(c) in an assignment for the benefit of the creditors of such Subsidiary Guarantor; or

(d) in any marshaling of such Subsidiary Guarantor’s assets and liabilities,

the holders of Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor will be entitled to receive payment in full
in cash of all obligations in respect of such Senior Debt (including interest after the commencement of
any proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt whether or not allowed or allowable
in any such proceeding) before the holders of Notes will be entitled to receive any payment with
respect to the Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor (except that holders of Notes may receive and
retain Permitted Junior Securities and payments made from the trust (if any) described under ‘‘—Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’).

**_Payment Blockage Provisions_**

The Indenture will also provide that a Subsidiary Guarantor may not make any payment in respect
of its Guarantee (except in Permitted Junior Securities or from the trust (if any) described under
‘‘—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’) if:

(a) a payment default on Designated Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor has occurred and
is continuing beyond any applicable grace period; or

45


-----

(b) any other default occurs and is continuing on any Designated Senior Debt of such Subsidiary
Guarantor that permits the holders of that Designated Senior Debt to accelerate its maturity
and the Trustee receives a notice of such default (a ‘‘Payment Blockage Notice’’) from the
Issuers or the holders of such Designated Senior Debt.

Payments on any such Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor may and will be resumed:

(i) in the case of a payment default on Designated Senior Debt, when such default is cured or
waived; or

(ii) in the case of a non-payment default on Designated Senior Debt, upon the earlier of the date
on which such non-payment default is cured or waived and 179 days after the date on which
the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received, unless the maturity of any Designated
Senior Debt has been accelerated.

No new Payment Blockage Notice may be delivered unless and until (x) 360 days have elapsed
since the delivery of the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice and (y) all scheduled payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes that have come due have been paid in full in
cash.

No non-payment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of a Payment
Blockage Notice to the Trustee will be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage
Notice.

**_Turnover_**

If the Trustee for or on behalf of the holders of the Notes receives a payment in respect of the
Notes (except in Permitted Junior Securities or from the trust (if any) described under ‘‘—Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’) when:

(a) the payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of the Indenture described in this
‘‘—Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees; Subordination’’ section; and

(b) the Trustee or the holder of the Note has actual knowledge that payment is so prohibited;

then the Trustee will hold the payment on trust for the benefit of the holders of the relevant
Senior Debt and, upon the proper written request of the holders of the relevant Senior Debt, the
Trustee will deliver the amounts in trust to the Senior Agent or any other proper representative of the
holders of the relevant Senior Debt.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the holders of Designated Senior
Debt of the Subsidiary Guarantors to give effect to the preceding subordination provisions of the
Indenture described in this ‘‘—Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees; Subordination’’ section. For a
description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
Agreement.’’

**Limitations Under Guarantees**

The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount
not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor without
resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee being voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws
relating to fraudulent transfer or under similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or the
maximum amount otherwise permitted by law. In particular, each Guarantee will be limited as required

46


-----

to comply with corporate benefit, maintenance of capital and other laws applicable in the jurisdiction of
the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor. By virtue of these limitations, a Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations
under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Notes, or a
Subsidiary Guarantor may have effectively no obligations under its Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance
laws and other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees of the Notes.’’

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will mature on July 15, 2027, and 100% of the principal amount of the Notes shall be
payable on the applicable maturity date thereof, unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein.
The Issuers will issue an aggregate principal amount of £400 million Notes in this offering. Subject to
the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt’’ and ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the Issuers are permitted to issue additional Notes as part of a
further issue under the Indenture (‘‘Additional Notes’’) from time to time; _provided that, if any_
Additional Notes are not fungible with any series of original Notes for U.S. income tax purposes, such
Additional Notes will have a separate ISIN and/or Common Code number, as the case may be. The
Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single
class for all purposes of the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase, except for certain waivers and amendments. Unless the context otherwise requires, references
to the ‘‘Notes’’ for all purposes of the Indenture and in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ include
references to any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of 4.750% per annum. Interest on the Notes will be
payable semi-annually in arrears from the Issue Date. Interest will be payable on each Note on
January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2018. The Issuers will pay interest on
each Note to holders of record of each Note in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as
of the immediately preceding January 1 or July 1, as the case may be. Interest will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and will be paid on overdue principal and
other overdue amounts at the same rate.

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be issued on the issue date of the Notes only in fully registered form without
coupons and only in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess
thereof.

The Notes will be initially in the form of one or more global notes (the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The
Global Notes will be deposited with a custodian for Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking. Ownership
of interests in the Global Notes, referred to as ‘‘book-entry interests,’’ will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Clearstream Banking and Euroclear. Book-entry interests will be shown on, and
transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear
and/or Clearstream Banking and its participants. The terms of the Indenture provide for the issuance
of definitive registered Notes in certain circumstances. See ‘‘Book-entry; Delivery and Form.’’

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Global Notes may be transferred in accordance with the Indenture. All transfers of book-entry
interests between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking will be effected by Euroclear
and/or Clearstream Banking pursuant to customary procedures and subject to applicable rules and
procedures established by Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking and it’s respective participants. See
‘‘Book-entry; Delivery and Form.’’

47


-----

The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as
described under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent**

The Issuers will make all payments, including principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
Notes, through an agent in London that it will maintain for these purposes. Initially that agent will be
Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The Issuers may change the paying agents without prior notice to the
holders of the Notes. In addition, the Issuers or any of their Subsidiaries may act as paying agent in
connection with the Notes other than for the purposes of effecting a redemption described under
‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ or an offer to purchase the Notes described under ‘‘—Purchase of Notes
upon a Change of Control’’ or ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets.’’ The
Issuers will make all payments in same-day funds. The Issuers undertake that they will maintain a
paying agent in the United Kingdom or an EU Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct
tax pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the
conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings
income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, any such
Directive. That paying agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch in London.

No service charge will be made for any registration of a transfer, exchange or redemption of the
Notes, but the Issuers may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar
governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange (but not
for a redemption).

**Additional Amounts**

All payments that the Issuers make under or with respect to the Notes or that the Guarantors
make under or with respect to the Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without withholding
or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other
governmental charge (including, without limitation, penalties, interest and other similar liabilities
related thereto) of whatever nature (collectively, ‘‘Taxes’’) imposed or levied on such payments by or on
behalf of any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia)
in which any Issuer or Guarantor is organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes or from or
through which any of the foregoing (or its agents, including the Paying Agent) makes any payment on
the Notes or by or within any department, political subdivision or governmental authority of or in any
of the foregoing having power to tax (each, a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’), unless such Issuer or
Guarantor or other applicable withholding agent, as the case may be, is required to withhold or deduct
Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration of law. If either Co-Issuer, Guarantor or other
applicable withholding agent is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes
imposed or levied on behalf of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with
respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, such Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay
additional amounts (‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
received by each beneficial owner of the Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any
withholding or deduction in respect of any Additional Amounts) will not be less than the amount the
beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted.

None of the Issuers or Guarantors will, however, pay Additional Amounts in respect or on account
of:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by
reason of the holder’s or beneficial owner’s present or former connection with such Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership, holding or disposition of Notes,

48


-----

or by reason of the receipt of any payments in respect of any Note or any Guarantee, or the
exercise or enforcement of rights under any Notes or any Guarantee);

(b) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the
holder or beneficial owner of Notes, following the Issuers’ written request addressed to the
holder or beneficial owner, to comply with any certification, identification, information or
other reporting requirements (to the extent such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible
to do so), whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of
deduction or withholding of, such Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident
in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax which is payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payments made
under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(e) any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment by any of the Issuers or Guarantors to the
holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial
owner of such payment to the extent that such Taxes would not have been imposed on such
payment had such beneficial owner been the holder of such Note;

(f) any Tax that is imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner
who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant
Notes to another paying agent in a member state of the European Union;

(g) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first
made available to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(h) any withholding or deduction in respect of any Taxes where such withholding or deduction is
imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to European
Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the
ECOFIN Council meetings of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or
any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, any such
Directive;

(i) any U.S. federal withholding Taxes or equivalent thereof imposed pursuant to Sections 1471
through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as of the Issue Date (or any amended or
successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply
with), any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or other official
administrative interpretations thereof and any agreements entered into pursuant to current
Section 1471(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as of the Issue Date (or any
amended or successor version described above), and including (for the avoidance of doubt)
any intergovernmental agreements (and any law, regulation, rule or practice implementing any
such intergovernmental agreement) in respect of the foregoing; or

(j) any combination of the foregoing.

The Issuers and the Guarantors, if the applicable withholding agents, will (i) make such
withholding or deduction as is required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law.

49


-----

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the
Notes or any Guarantee is due and payable, if the Issuers or a Guarantor will be obligated to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to such payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises after the 30th day prior to the date on which payment under or with respect to the Notes or any
Guarantee is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuers will deliver to
the Trustee, with a copy to the Paying Agent, an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information
necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date.
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. The Issuers will promptly publish a notice in
accordance with the provisions set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’ stating that such Additional Amounts will be
payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

In addition, the Issuers and the Guarantors will pay any present or future stamp, issuance,
registration, court, documentary, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes, charges and duties,
including without limitation, interest, penalties and other similar liabilities with respect thereto,
imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of (i) the execution, issue, delivery or
registration of the Notes or any Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to
thereunder, or (ii) the receipt of any payments under or with respect to, or enforcement of, the Notes
or any Guarantee.

Upon written request, any of the Issuers or a Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee or a holder
within a reasonable time certified copies of tax receipts evidencing any payment by such Issuer or
Guarantor (as the case may be) of any Taxes imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, in
accordance with the procedures described in ‘‘—Notices’’ hereafter, in such form as provided in the
normal course by the taxing authority imposing such Taxes. If, notwithstanding the efforts of such Issuer
or Guarantor to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, such Issuer or Guarantor will
provide the Trustee or such holder with other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or holder
of such payments by such Issuer or Guarantor. If requested by the Trustee, the Issuers and (to the
extent necessary) any Guarantors will provide to the Trustee such information as may be reasonably
available to such Issuer and the Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee) to
enable determination of the amount of any withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder(s).

Whenever the Indenture or this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ refers to, in any context, the payment
of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note
(including payments thereof made pursuant to a Guarantee), such reference includes the payment of
Additional Amounts, if applicable.

The preceding provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture
and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or
the District of Columbia) in which any successor person to any of the Issuers or Guarantors is
organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which any
such person (or its agents, including the Paying Agent) makes any payment on the Note (or any
Guarantee) and any department, political subdivision or governmental authority of or in any of the
foregoing having the power to tax.

**Currency Indemnity**

Pounds sterling is the required currency (the ‘‘Required Currency’’) of account and payment for all
sums payable under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture. Any amount received or recovered
in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees in a currency other than the Required Currency (whether as
a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the
winding-up or dissolution of each Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Trustee or a holder of the

50


-----

Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such holder from the Issuers or the Guarantors will
constitute a discharge of their obligation only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency
which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in such other currency
on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to purchase the Required Currency on
that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If the amount of the Required Currency to
be recovered is less than the amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due to the recipient
under any Note, the Issuers or the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making
any further purchase of the Required Currency in an amount equal to such difference. For the
purposes of this paragraph, it will be sufficient for the holder to certify that it would have suffered a
loss had the actual purchase of the Required Currency been made with the amount so received in that
other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of the Required Currency on that
date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would have been possible). These indemnities,
to the extent permitted by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ other
obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder of a Note; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

**Optional Redemption**

**_Optional Redemption prior to July 15, 2020 upon Public Equity Offering_**

At any time prior to July 15, 2020, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the
Issuers may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes at a redemption price of 104.750% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to (but excluding) the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant
record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date), with the net cash proceeds from
one or more Public Equity Offerings. The Issuers may only do this, however, if:

(a) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that were initially issued would
remain outstanding immediately after the proposed redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 120 days after the closing of such Public Equity Offering.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent.

**_Optional Redemption prior to July 15, 2022_**

At any time prior to July 15, 2022, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the
Issuers may also redeem all or part of the Notes, as the case may be, at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus the Applicable Redemption Premium
and accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the redemption date.

‘‘Applicable Redemption Premium’’ means with respect to the Notes on any redemption date, the
greater of:

(1) 1.0% of the principal amount of the Notes; and

51


-----

(2) the excess of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of (x) the redemption price of the Note at
July 15, 2022 (such redemption price being set forth in the table appearing below under
the caption ‘‘—Optional Redemption on or after July 15, 2022’’), plus (y) all required
interest payments due on such Note through July 15, 2022 (excluding accrued but unpaid
interest), computed using a discount rate equal to the Gilt Rate as of such redemption
date plus 50 basis points; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Note.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of the Applicable Redemption Premium shall not be a duty
or obligation of the Trustee or any Paying Agent.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent.

**_Optional Redemption on or after July 15, 2022_**

At any time on or after July 15, 2022 and prior to maturity, upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ notice, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the Notes. These redemptions will be in amounts
of £1,000 or integral multiples thereof at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the
redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on July 15 of the years set
forth below. This redemption is subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record
date that is prior to the redemption date to receive interest due on an interest payment date.

more conditions precedent.

**_Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

If, as a result of:

(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which is announced and becomes effective after the Issue
Date (or, where such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at a
later date, after such later date); or

(b) any change which is announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, where such
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at a later date, after such
later date) in the official application or official interpretation of such laws, regulations or
rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court competent jurisdiction)
of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a ‘‘Change in
Tax Law’’),

the Issuers would be obligated to pay, on the next date for any payment and as a result of that
amendment or change, Additional Amounts as described above under ‘‘—Additional Amounts’’ with
respect to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, which the Issuers cannot avoid by the use of reasonable

52


-----

measures available to it, then the Issuers may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes, at any
time thereafter, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (which notice shall be irrevocable
and given in accordance with the procedures described under ‘‘—Notices’’), at a redemption price of
100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the
redemption date. Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption described in this paragraph, the
Issuers will deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be
avoided by the Issuers’ taking reasonable measures available to it; and

(b) a written opinion of independent tax counsel to the Issuers of recognized standing qualified
under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
to the effect that the Issuers have or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts
as a result of a Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will
be conclusive and binding on holders of the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days
prior to the earliest date on which the Issuers would be obliged to make such payment of Additional
Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes, were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is
given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent.

**Notice of Optional Redemption**

The Issuers will publish a notice of any optional redemption of the Notes described above in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Notices.’’ These notice provisions
include a requirement to publish any such notice in a newspaper having general circulation in Ireland
(which is expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of
the Irish Stock Exchange, posted on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie) if and
so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require.
The Issuers will inform the Irish Stock Exchange of the principal amount of the Notes that have not
been redeemed in connection with any optional redemption. If fewer than all the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, the Notes will be selected by a method that complies with the requirements, as
certified to the Trustee by the Issuers, of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes
are listed at such time, and in compliance with the requirements of the relevant clearing system or, if
the Notes are not listed on a securities exchange, or such securities exchange prescribe no method of
selection and the Notes are not held through a clearing system or the clearing system prescribes no
method of selection, by lot; provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion
of the principal amount of a Note not redeemed to less than £100,000. Neither the Trustee nor the
Registrar shall be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent.

**Sinking Fund; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuers are not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor may
be required to offer to purchase the Notes as described under ‘‘—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of
Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets.’’ The Parent Guarantor and

53


-----

any Restricted Subsidiaries, including the Issuers, may at any time and from time to time purchase
Notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs at any time, then the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must make an
offer (a ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) to each holder of Notes to purchase such holder’s Notes, at a
purchase price (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Price’’) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the
‘‘Change of Control Purchase Date’’) (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant regular
record dates that are prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on an
interest payment date). Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other
procedures set forth in the Indenture.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor will:

(a) cause a notice of the Change of Control Offer to be (i) delivered to holders of the Notes
electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid; and (ii) if at the time of such
notice the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock
Exchange so require, published in The Irish Times (or another leading newspaper of general
circulation in Ireland or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Irish
Stock Exchange, posted on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie)); and

(b) send notice of the Change of Control Offer by first class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to
each holder of Notes to the address of such holder appearing in the security register, which
notice will state:

(i) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred;

(ii) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control (including, but not
limited to, applicable information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow
and capitalization after giving effect to the Change of Control);

(iii) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which
will be a business day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the
Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations;

(iv) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease
to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of
Control Purchase Price is not paid;

(v) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(vi) any other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control
Offer or to withdraw such acceptance (which procedures may also be performed at the
office of the paying agent in Ireland as long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock
Exchange).

The Trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes equal in principal amount
to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Notes in global form or to
each holder of certificated Notes; provided that each such new Note or Notes will be in a total
principal amount of at least £100,000 and in minimum denominations of £1,000 or integral multiples
thereof. The Issuers or the Parent Guarantor will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control
Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

54


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of
Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of
Control Offer is made.

The ability of the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that
would constitute a Change of Control could constitute a default under certain of our Credit Facilities
or could constitute a change of control under the Existing Ardagh Bonds. In addition, certain events
that may constitute a change of control under certain of our Credit Facilities, the Existing Ardagh
Bonds may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The Parent Guarantor’s future
indebtedness and the future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may also require such indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their
right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under such
indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the
Issuers or the Parent Guarantor of such repurchase.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, neither the Issuers nor the Parent Guarantor can provide
any assurance that they will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price
for all the Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of
Control Offer. If the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor fails to make or consummate a Change of
Control Offer or pay the Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an
Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the holders of the Notes the rights described under
‘‘—Events of Default.’’

Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the Parent
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the distribution of such funds or the prepayment of the
Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor were not able to prepay
any indebtedness containing any such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the Issuers and the
Parent Guarantor would be unable to fulfill their repurchase obligations to holders of Notes who
exercise their right to redeem their Notes following a Change of Control, which would cause a Default
under the Indenture. A Default under the Indenture, unless waived by holders, would result in a crossdefault under certain of the financing arrangements described under ‘‘Description of Other
Indebtedness.’’

Neither the Issuers nor the Parent Guarantor will be required to make a Change of Control Offer
if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions described above will
be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described
above with respect to a Change of Control, the provisions of the Indenture will not give holders the
right to require the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor to repurchase the Notes in the event of certain
highly leveraged transactions, or certain other transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring,
merger or similar transaction and, in certain circumstances, an acquisition by the Parent Guarantor’s
management or its Affiliates, that may adversely affect holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a
transaction defined as a Change of Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Debt.’’ The existence of a holder of the Notes’ right to require the Issuers
or the Parent Guarantor to repurchase such holder’s Notes upon a Change of Control may deter a
third party from acquiring the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries in a transaction which constitutes a
Change of Control.

55


-----

The Issuers and the Parent Guarantor will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations (including
those of Ireland) in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers and the Parent
Guarantor will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached their obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

‘‘Change of Control’’ means the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) the consummation of any transaction (including a merger or consolidation) the result of which
is that (i) any person or group, other than one or more Permitted Holders, is or as a result of
such transaction becomes, the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 35% of the
total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Parent Guarantor and (ii) the Permitted
Holders, individually or in the aggregate, do not beneficially own, directly or indirectly, a
larger percentage of the total voting power of such Voting Stock than such other person or
group;

(b) the sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, consolidation
or transfer of the Parent Guarantor’s Voting Stock or in connection with a Permitted
Reorganization) of all or substantially all of the assets (other than Capital Stock, Debt or
other securities of any Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the
Restricted Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, to any person or group other than one or
more Permitted Holders; or

(c) the Parent Guarantor or either Issuer is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation
or dissolution other than in a transaction which does not violate the provisions described
under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets’’ or in connection
with a Permitted Reorganization.

(d) the Parent Guarantor or any Surviving Entity ceases to beneficially own, directly or indirectly,
100% of the Voting Stock of either Issuer, other than director’s qualifying shares and other
shares required to be issued by law.

For the purposes of this definition, (i) ‘‘person’’ and ‘‘group’’ have the meanings they have in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act; (ii) ‘‘beneficial owner’’ is used as defined in Rules 13d-3
and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, except that a person shall be deemed to have ‘‘beneficial
ownership’’ of all securities that such Person has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable
immediately or only after the passage of time; and (iii) a Person or group will be deemed to
beneficially own all Voting Stock of an entity held by a parent entity, if such Person or group is or
becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 35% of the total voting power of the
Voting Stock of such parent entity and the Permitted Holders, individually or in the aggregate, do not
beneficially own, directly or indirectly, a larger percentage of the total voting power of such Voting
Stock than such Person or group.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, issue,
incur, assume, guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to
or otherwise become responsible for, contingently or otherwise, the payment of (individually
and collectively, to ‘‘incur’’ or, as appropriate, an ‘‘incurrence’’), any Debt (including any
Acquired Debt); provided that the Parent Guarantor, each Issuer and any Restricted

56


-----

Subsidiary will be permitted to incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if in each case (a) after
giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, on a
pro forma basis, no Default or Event of Default would occur or be continuing and (b) at the
time of such incurrence and after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and the
application of the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available
immediately preceding the incurrence of such Debt, taken as one period, would be greater
than 2.0 to 1.0.

(2) This covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(a) the Notes issued on the Issue Date;

A265,000,000 and 3.5% of Total Assets;

(s) Debt of any Person (i) Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person

the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to provide all or any

(t) Contribution Debt.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization

Debt of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Debt for purposes of this
covenant.

(3) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Debt in
euros where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Debt will be the
Euro Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided that if any such Debt
denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to
euros) covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed
in euros will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. The principal
amount of any Permitted Refinancing Debt incurred in the same currency as the Debt being
refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the Debt refinanced determined on the date such
Debt being refinanced was initially incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant,
increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies will not be

59


-----

deemed to exceed the maximum amount that an Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or a Subsidiary
Guarantor may incur under this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant.

(4) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’
covenant:

(a) obligations with respect to letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting
Debt otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount will not be
included;

(b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions described under
‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ will not be treated as Debt;

(c) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the obligation to
pay commitment fees and the payment of interest in the form of additional preferred
stock or Debt will not be treated as Debt; and

(d) the reclassification of preferred stock as Debt due to a change in accounting principles
will not be treated as Debt.

(5) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Debt
described in this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, the Parent Guarantor, in its sole discretion,
will classify items of Debt and will only be required to include the amount and type of such
Debt in one of such clauses and the Parent Guarantor will be entitled to divide and classify an
item of Debt in more than one of the types of Debt described in this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’
covenant, and may change the classification of an item of Debt (or any portion thereof) to any
other type of Debt described in this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant at any time.

(6) The amount of any Debt outstanding as of any date will be:

(a) in the case of any Debt issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in
respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS;

(b) the principal amount of the Debt, in the case of any other Debt; and

(c) in respect of Debt of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Debt of the other Person.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

indirectly, take any of the following actions (each of which is a ‘‘Restricted Payment’’ and

Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with
any merger or consolidation involving the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary)
(other than (i) to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) to all holders

would receive on a pro rata basis; provided that any amount so paid or distributed to
holders of Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary other than the Parent Guarantor or a

an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee) resolving that such transaction complies with clause (a)
above and that the fairness of such transaction has been approved by a majority of the

advantageous group contribution made pursuant to applicable legislation provided, however,
that any such payments do not exceed the amounts of such tax that would have been payable
by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis and the
related tax liabilities of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved
thereby;

otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture that are fair to the Parent
Guarantor or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of
the Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor or the senior management thereof, or are on
terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated Person;

(xiii) any transaction effected as part of a Permitted Receivables Financing;

(xiv) pledges of equity interests of Unrestricted Subsidiaries; and

(xv) any employment agreement, consultancy agreement or employee benefit arrangement with

The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind (except for Permitted Liens) or
assign or otherwise convey any right to receive any income, profits or proceeds on or with respect to
any of the Parent Guarantor’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s property or assets, including any shares of
stock or any Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary but excluding any Capital Stock, Debt or other

66


-----

securities of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, whether owned at or acquired after the Issue Date, or any
income, profits or proceeds therefrom unless:

(a) in the case of any Lien securing Subordinated Debt, the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the
Notes (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Debt of a Guarantor) are
directly secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to the
Lien securing the Subordinated Debt until such time as the Subordinated Debt is no longer
secured by a Lien; and

(b) in the case of any other Lien, the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the Notes (or a Guarantee
in the case of Liens securing Debt of a Guarantor), and all other amounts due under the
Indenture are equally and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien.

**_Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets_**

(1) The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate
any Asset Sale unless:

(a) the consideration the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such
Asset Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold (as determined in
good faith by the Parent Guarantor’s board of directors);

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary
receives in respect of such Asset Sale consists of (i) cash (including any Net Cash
Proceeds received from the conversion within 90 days of such Asset Sale of securities,
notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset Sale); (ii) Cash
Equivalents; (iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) the Parent Guarantor’s Debt or
Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt) as a result of which
neither the Parent Guarantor nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in
respect of such Debt or (y) Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, if the Parent Guarantor and each other
Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Debt as a result of such
Asset Sale; (iv) Replacement Assets; (v) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received
by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an
aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash
Consideration received pursuant to this clause (b), not to exceed the greater of
A100,000,000 and 1.25% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated
Non-cash Consideration, with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated
Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value or (vi) a combination of the consideration specified in
clauses (i) to (v); and

(c) the Parent Guarantor delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee certifying that such
Asset Sale complies with the provisions described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b).

(2) If the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net
Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale, within 360 days after the consummation of such Asset
Sale, may be used by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary to (i) permanently
repay or prepay any then outstanding Debt (other than Debt that is subordinated to the Notes
or the Guarantees of the Notes) of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary (and to
effect a corresponding commitment reduction if such Debt is revolving credit borrowings)
owing to a Person other than the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) invest in
any Replacement Assets, (iii) acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or any Capital Stock
of, another Similar Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the

67


-----

Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or (iv) any combination of the
foregoing; provided that in the case of clause (ii), if the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, has entered into a binding commitment in definitive form
within such 360-day period to so apply such Net Cash Proceeds with the good faith
expectation that such Net Cash Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within
180 days of such commitment (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’), such binding commitment shall
be treated as a permitted application of such Net Cash Proceeds; provided, further, that if any
Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Cash
Proceeds are applied and after such initial 360-day period, then such Net Cash Proceeds shall
constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below). The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so
used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ The Parent Guarantor
may reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any
manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

(3) The Parent Guarantor or the Issuers may also at any time, and the Parent Guarantor or the
Issuers will within 20 Business Days after the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
A50,000,000, make an offer to purchase (an ‘‘Excess Proceeds Offer’’) from all holders of the
Notes and from the holders of any Pari passu Debt, to the extent required by the terms
thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or
the agreements governing any such Pari passu Debt, the maximum principal amount
(expressed as an integral multiple of £1,000) of the Notes and any such Pari passu Debt that
may be purchased with the amount of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price as to each Note
and any such Pari passu Debt will be payable in cash in an amount equal to (solely in the case
of the Notes) 100% of the principal amount of such Note and (solely in the case of Pari passu
Debt) no greater than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such
Pari passu Debt, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari passu Debt
tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to
purchase the Notes and Pari passu Debt for general corporate purposes that are not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and any such Pari
passu Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari passu Debt to be purchased will be
selected by the Trustee on a pro rata basis (based upon the principal amount of the Notes and
the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari passu Debt tendered by each Holder).
Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be
reset to zero.

(4) If the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers are obligated to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the
Parent Guarantor or the Issuers will purchase the Notes and Pari passu Debt, at the option of
the holders thereof, in whole or in part (as an integral multiple of £1,000), on a date that is
not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Excess
Proceeds Offer is given to such holders, or such later date as may be required under the
Exchange Act; provided that Notes of £100,000 will be purchased in full.

If the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers are required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the
Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations,
including any securities laws of Ireland and the requirements of any applicable securities
exchange on which Notes or the Existing Ardagh Bonds are then listed. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, we
will comply with such securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
our obligations described in this covenant by virtue thereof.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Parent Guarantor will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Issuer or a
Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable
for the payment of any Pari passu Debt or Subordinated Debt of either Issuer (other than the
Notes), the Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(a) such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture
to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee of payment of the Notes by such Restricted
Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such Debt; and

(b) with respect to any guarantee of Subordinated Debt by such Restricted Subsidiary, any
such guarantee shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee with
respect to the Notes at least to the same extent as such Subordinated Debt is
subordinated to the Notes.

This paragraph (1) will not be applicable to any guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary:

(i) existing on the Issue Date, guaranteeing Debt under Credit Facilities permitted to be
incurred pursuant to paragraphs (2)(b) and 2(m) of the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’ or guaranteeing Debt in an aggregate principal amount that is
less than A75,000,000;

(ii) that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee was
not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a
Restricted Subsidiary; or

(iii) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided
profits of not less than A500 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee
was given, of at least BBB+ or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least Baa1 or the
equivalent thereof by Moody’s, in connection with the operation of cash management
programs established for the Parent Guarantor’s benefit or that of any Restricted
Subsidiary.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantee of the Notes created pursuant to the provisions
described in paragraph (1) above may provide by its terms that it will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(a) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person who is not the Parent Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary of all of the Capital Stock owned by the Parent Guarantor and its
other Restricted Subsidiaries in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted
Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is not prohibited by the Indenture); or

(b) (with respect to any Guarantee created after the Issue Date) the release by the holders of
the applicable Issuer’s, the Parent Guarantor’s or the Subsidiary Guarantor’s Debt
described in paragraph (1) above, of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
(including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Debt
other than as a result of payment under such guarantee), at a time when:

(i) no other Debt of either Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor
has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(ii) the holders of all such other Debt that is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary
also release their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed
release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Debt other than as a result
of payment under such guarantee); or

69


-----

(c) the release of the Guarantees on the terms and conditions and in the circumstances
described in ‘‘—Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees; Subordination’’ and in ‘‘—The
Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees.’’

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Guarantor shall not be obligated to cause any such
Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee would reasonably be
expected to give rise to or result in (A) any violation of applicable law, rule, regulation or order that
cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Parent
Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, (B) personal liability for the officers, directors or shareholders
of such Restricted Subsidiary or (C) any significant cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with
respect to any Taxes but excluding any reasonable guarantee or similar fee payable to the Parent
Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary) other than any governmental or regulatory filings required as a
result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (A) undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee,
which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Parent Guarantor or the
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that any Restricted Subsidiary who directly or indirectly,
guarantees, assumes or in any other manner become liable for the payment of any obligations under
the Existing Ardagh Bonds shall also be required to Guarantee payment of the Notes on the same
terms as the guarantee of such obligations.

Each such additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose and corporate benefit, thin capitalization,
distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

**_Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual
encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its
Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Parent Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Parent Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Parent Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary.

(2) The provisions of the covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to:

(a) encumbrances and restrictions imposed by the Notes, the Existing Ardagh Bonds, the
Indenture, any Credit Facility, the indentures governing the Existing Ardagh Bonds, the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), and the security
documents related thereto or by other indentures or agreements governing other Debt we
incur ranking equally with the Notes;

(b) any customary encumbrances or restrictions created under any agreements with respect to
Debt of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be incurred
subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ including encumbrances or restrictions imposed by Debt
permitted to be incurred under Credit Facilities or any guarantees thereof in accordance
with such covenant; _provided that such agreements do not prohibit the payment of interest_

70


-----

with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees absent a default or event of default under
such agreement;

(c) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement in effect on the Issue Date
(other than an agreement described in another clause of this paragraph (2));

(d) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above,
encumbrances and restrictions that restrict in a customary manner the subletting,
assignment or transfer of any properties or assets that are subject to a lease, license,
conveyance or other similar agreement to which the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted
Subsidiary is a party;

(e) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement or other instrument of a Person
(including its Subsidiaries) acquired by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary
in effect at the time of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which
encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of
any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired
(including its Subsidiaries);

(f) encumbrances or restrictions contained in contracts for sales of Capital Stock or assets
permitted by the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets’’ with
respect to the assets or Capital Stock to be sold pursuant to such contract or in
customary merger or acquisition agreements (or any option to enter into such contract)
for the purchase or acquisition of Capital Stock or assets or any of the Parent
Guarantor’s Subsidiaries by another Person;

(g) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, any
customary encumbrances or restrictions pertaining to any asset or property subject to a
Lien to the extent set forth in the security document or any related document governing
such Lien;

(h) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by applicable law or regulation or by governmental
licenses, concessions, franchises or permits;

(i) encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by
customers under contracts entered into the ordinary course of business;

(j) customary limitations on the distribution or disposition of assets or property in joint
venture agreements entered into the ordinary course of business and in good faith by any
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such encumbrance or restriction is applicable only to
such Restricted Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries;

(k) in the case of clause (1)(d) above, customary encumbrances or restrictions in connection
with purchase money obligations, mortgage financings and Capitalized Lease Obligations
for property acquired in the ordinary course of business;

(l) any encumbrance or restriction arising by reason of customary non-assignment provisions
in agreements;

(m) encumbrances or restrictions with respect to any Permitted Receivables Financing;
_provided that such encumbrances or restrictions are customarily required by the_
institutional sponsor or arranger of such Permitted Receivables Financing in similar types
of documents relating to the purchase of similar receivables in connection with the
financing thereof;

(n) encumbrances or restrictions with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to
a Permitted Joint Venture;

71


-----

(o) encumbrances or restrictions incurred in accordance with the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’; or

(p) any encumbrances or restrictions existing under any agreement that extends, renews,
amends, modifies, restates, supplements, refunds, refinances or replaces the agreements
containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (2)(a) through (o);
_provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are not_
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the holders of the Notes than those under
or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, amended, modified, restated,
supplemented, refunded, refinanced or replaced.

**_Limitation on Layered Debt_**

The Subsidiary Guarantors will not incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become
liable for any Debt that is subordinate or junior in right of payment to any Senior Debt of the
Subsidiary Guarantors and senior in any respect in right of payment to the Guarantees or any other
Pari passu Debt of the Subsidiary Guarantors; provided that the foregoing limitation will not apply to
distinctions between categories of Senior Debt that exist by reason of any Liens or guarantees arising
or created in respect of some but not all of such Senior Debt or pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement (and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement).

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request and direction of the Parent Guarantor and without
the consent of the holders of the Notes, in connection with the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor or
its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Permitted Debt, the Parent Guarantor, the relevant Restricted
Subsidiaries and the Trustee shall enter into with the holders of such Debt (or their duly authorized
representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement, in each case on
substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement or terms not violating the terms of the
Indenture (for such matters covered by the Indenture) or terms not affecting adversely the rights of the
holders of the Notes in material respects (for such matters not covered by the Indenture), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees; provided that such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the
opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under
the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the request and direction of the Parent Guarantor and
without the consent of the holders of the Notes, the Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or
more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Debt covered by any such
agreement that may be incurred by an Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to any such agreement
(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Debt ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add
Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with
the terms thereof or (5) make any other change to any such agreement that does not violate the terms
of the Indenture. The Parent Guarantor shall not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders of the majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
‘‘Amendments and Waivers,’’ and the Parent Guarantor may only direct the Trustee to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or,

72


-----

in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities
under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders of the Notes to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any
obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided, however, that such transaction would comply_
with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be
deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee to enter into any such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any
Business Day upon prior written request at the offices of the Listing Agent.

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent Guarantor’s board of directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired
or newly established Subsidiaries) to be an ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’ only if no Default has occurred
and is continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such designation.

In the event of any such designation, the Parent Guarantor will be deemed to have made an
Investment constituting a Restricted Payment pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation
on Restricted Payments’’ for all purposes of the Indenture in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the
net book value of the Parent Guarantor’s interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with
IFRS or (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Parent Guarantor’s interest in such Subsidiary.

The Parent Guarantor’s board of directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a
Restricted Subsidiary if (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time
of or will occur and be continuing after giving effect to such designation and (ii) (x) the Parent
Guarantor could incur at least A1.00 of additional Debt under the first paragraph of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation of Indebtedness’’ or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such designation, in each case,
on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation.

Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Parent
Guarantor’s board of directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Parent
Guarantor’s board of directors with the Trustee giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the foregoing conditions, and giving the
effective date of such designation. Any such filing with the Trustee must occur within 45 days after the
end of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal quarter in which such designation is made (or, in the case of a
designation made during the last fiscal quarter of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal year, within 90 days
after the end of such fiscal year).

**_Reports to Holders_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor will furnish to the
Trustee:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal year’s annual reports
containing the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Parent
Guarantor as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent Guarantor for the two most recent fiscal

73


-----

years, including footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the Parent
Guarantor’s independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) an operating and financial
review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material
commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (c) a description of the
business and management of the Parent Guarantor; and (d) material recent developments to
the extent not previously reported;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of
the Parent Guarantor’s quarterly reports containing the following information: (a) an
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the quarterly and year-to-date periods
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods
for the Parent Guarantor, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the
consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Parent Guarantor and any
material change between the current quarterly period and the corresponding period of the
prior year; and (c) material recent developments to the extent not previously reported; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the
Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any change of the
entire board of directors, chairman of the board of directors, chief executive officer or chief
financial officer at the Parent Guarantor or change in auditors of the Parent Guarantor, a
press release containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor shall furnish to the holders of the Notes and to
prospective investors, upon the requests of such holders, any information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are not freely transferable
under the Exchange Act by Persons who are not ‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

The Issuers or the Parent Guarantor will also make available copies of all reports furnished to the
Trustee (a) on the website of the Ardagh group of companies; and (b) through the newswire service of
Bloomberg, or, if Bloomberg does not then operate, any similar agency.

**_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_**

The Parent Guarantor will not, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions,
consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by the Parent Guarantor’s board of
directors or shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to which the Parent
Guarantor would dispose of, all or substantially all of the Parent Guarantor’s properties and assets
(other than Capital Stock, Debt or other securities of any Unrestricted Subsidiary) to any other Person
or Persons and the Parent Guarantor will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into any such
transaction or series of transactions if such transaction or series of transactions, in the aggregate, would
result in the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all
of the properties and assets (other than Capital Stock, Debt or other securities of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary) of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to any other
Person or Persons. The previous sentence will not apply if:

(a) at the time of, and immediately after giving effect to, any such transaction or series of
transactions, either (i) the Parent Guarantor will be the continuing corporation or (ii) the
Person (if other than the Parent Guarantor) formed by or surviving any such consolidation or
merger or to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or
substantially all the properties and assets of the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted

74


-----

Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis has been made (the ‘‘Surviving Entity’’) (x) will be a
corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any member state of the
European Union or the European Economic Area, the United States of America, any state
thereof, the District of Columbia, Canada, Switzerland, Australia or Bermuda and (y) will
expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the Parent
Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, and the Notes and the Indenture
will remain in full force and effect as so supplemented;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma
basis (and treating any obligation of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary
incurred in connection with or as a result of such transaction or series of transactions as
having been incurred by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of
such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing;

(c) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of
transactions on a pro forma basis (on the assumption that the transaction or series of
transactions occurred on the first day of the four-quarter fiscal period immediately prior to
the consummation of such transaction or series of transactions with the appropriate
adjustments with respect to the transaction or series of transactions being included in such pro
forma calculation), the Parent Guarantor (or the Surviving Entity if the Parent Guarantor is
not the continuing obligor under the Indenture) could incur at least A1.00 of additional Debt
under the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’;

(d) any Subsidiary Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, will
have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee will apply to such Person’s
obligations under the Indenture and the Notes;

(e) any of the Parent Guarantor’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s property or assets would
thereupon become subject to any Lien, the provisions of the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ are complied with; and

(f) the Parent Guarantor or the Surviving Entity will have delivered to the Trustee, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate (attaching the computations to
demonstrate compliance with clause (c) above) and an opinion of independent counsel, each
stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other
disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction,
such supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements of the Indenture and that the
Indenture and the Notes constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the continuing
person, enforceable in accordance with their terms.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, the Parent Guarantor may designate any
Person as a successor parent guarantor (the ‘‘Successor Parent Guarantor’’), _provided that the Parent_
Guarantor could have merged or amalgamated in-to such Person in accordance with the provisions of
this covenant, at the time of, and immediately after giving effect to such designation; provided, further
that such Successor Parent Guarantor expressly assumes, by a supplemental indenture in form
satisfactory to the Trustee, the Parent Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture.

The Surviving Entity or Successor Parent Guarantor, as applicable, will succeed to, and be
substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Parent Guarantor under the Indenture,
but, in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of the Parent Guarantor’s assets or in the case of
the designation of a Successor Parent Guarantor in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the
Parent Guarantor will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest, on the Notes.

75


-----

Nothing in the Indenture will prevent (i) any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with,
merging into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Parent Guarantor
or any other Restricted Subsidiary; (ii) any Subsidiary Guarantor from consolidating with, merging into
or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Parent Guarantor, either Issuer
or another Subsidiary Guarantor (and upon any such transfer, the Guarantee of the transferring
Subsidiary Guarantor shall automatically be released); or (iii) the Parent Guarantor from appointing
any Person as Successor Parent Guarantor that such appointment is made in accordance with the
second paragraph of this covenant above.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there
is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

The Parent Guarantor will publish a notice of any consolidation, merger or sale of assets described
above in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Notices’’ and, so long as
the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, notify such exchange of any such consolidation,
merger or sale.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ‘‘Suspension Event’’), then, beginning on
that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under
the following captions will not apply to such Notes: ‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ ‘‘—Limitation on
Restricted Payments,’’ ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,’’
‘‘—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates,’’ ‘‘—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets,’’ ‘‘—Limitation
on Guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ ‘‘—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ and the provisions of clause (c) of the first paragraph of
the covenant described under ‘‘—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets,’’ and, in each case, any
related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the
Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will
again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in
effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Parent
Guarantor properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the ‘‘—Limitation on
Restricted Payments’’ covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the
Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted
Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred during
the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Parent Guarantor’s option, as having
been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’
or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Debt
would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Debt
Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such
Debt would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ such Debt will be deemed to have been outstanding on the
Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (2)(c) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt.’’

**Events of Default**

(1) Each of the following will be an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts
on any Note;

(b) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at its Maturity
(upon acceleration, optional or mandatory redemption, if any, required repurchase or
otherwise), whether or not prohibited by the subordination provisions of the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement (and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement);

(c) failure to comply with the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets’’;

(d) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Parent Guarantor or of any
Restricted Subsidiary that is contained in the Indenture or any Guarantees (other than
specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) above) and such failure continues for a period of
60 days or more, in each case after the written notice specified in clause (2) below;

(e) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing the Debt of the Parent
Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary having an outstanding principal amount in excess
of A75,000,000, in each case, individually or in the aggregate, if that default: (x) results in
the acceleration of the payment of such Debt or (y) is caused by the failure to pay such
Debt at final maturity thereof after giving effect to the expiration of any applicable grace
periods and other than by regularly scheduled required prepayment, and such failure to
make any payment has not been waived or the maturity of such Debt has not been
extended, and in either case the total amount of such Debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds
A75,000,000 or its equivalent at the time;

(f) any Guarantee ceases to be, or shall be asserted in writing by any Guarantor, or any
Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, not to be in full force and effect or
enforceable in accordance with its terms (other than as provided for in the Indenture, any
Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement);

(g) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal and not covered by
insurance) shall be rendered against the Parent Guarantor or any Material Subsidiary,
either individually or in an aggregate amount, in excess of A75,000,000 or its equivalent at
the time, and either a creditor shall have commenced an enforcement proceeding upon
such judgment, order or decree or there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days
or more during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, order or decree was not
(by reason of pending appeal or otherwise) in effect; and

(h) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization
with respect to the Parent Guarantor or any Material Subsidiary.

(2) If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (1)(h) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding by written notice to the Issuers and the Parent Guarantor (and to
the Trustee if such notice is given by the holders) may, and the Trustee, upon the written
request of such holders, shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and any Additional
Amounts and accrued interest on all of the outstanding Notes immediately due and payable,
and upon any such declaration all such amounts payable in respect of the Notes will become
immediately due and payable.

77


-----

(3) If an Event of Default specified in clause (1)(h) above occurs and is continuing, then the
principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all
of the outstanding Notes shall become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of Notes.

(4) At any time after a declaration of acceleration under the Indenture, but before a judgment or
decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee, the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, by written notice to the
Issuers, the Parent Guarantor and the Trustee, may rescind such declaration and its
consequences if:

(a) the Parent Guarantor or either Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay:

(i) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts on all Notes then outstanding;

(ii) all unpaid principal of and premium, if any, on any outstanding Notes that has
become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon
at the rate borne by the Notes;

(iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest
and overdue principal at the rate borne by the Notes; and

(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel;

(b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction; and

(c) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of amounts of principal of, premium, if
any, and any Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes that has become due solely
by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

(5) The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes may, on behalf of the holders of all the Notes, waive any past defaults under the
Indenture, except a default:

(a) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest
on any Note; or

(b) in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or
amended without the consent of the holders of 90% of the outstanding Notes.

(6) No holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the
Indenture or any remedy thereunder, unless the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes have made a written request to, and offered indemnity
and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) reasonably satisfactory to, the Trustee to
institute such proceeding as trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed
to institute such proceeding within 30 days after receipt of such notice and indemnity or
security and the Trustee within such 30-day period has not received directions inconsistent
with such written request by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a
Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional

78


-----

Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such
Note.

(7) If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and is known to a responsible
officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will mail to each holder of the Notes notice of the Default
or Event of Default within 15 Business Days after its occurrence. Except in the case of a
Default or an Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, and Additional
Amounts or interest on any Notes, the Trustee may withhold the notice to the holders of such
Notes if its trust officers in good faith determine that withholding the notice is in the interests
of the holders of the Notes. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of
the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or
direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee, and the
Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory
to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense.

(8) The Issuers and the Parent Guarantor are required to furnish to the Trustee annual
statements as to the performance of the Issuers, the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted
Subsidiaries under the Indenture and as to any default in such performance. The Issuers and
the Parent Guarantor are also required to notify the Trustee within 15 Business Days of the
occurrence of any Default stating what action, if any, they are taking with respect to that
Default.

(9) In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default as
described in clause (e) of paragraph (1) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to such clause (e) shall be remedied or
cured, or waived by the holders of the Debt that gave rise to such Event of Default, or such
Debt shall have been discharged in full, within 20 days after the Event of Default arose and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration (if applicable) of the Notes would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default,
except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on
the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured
or waived.

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuers and the Parent Guarantor may, at their option and at
any time prior to the Stated Maturity of the Notes, elect to have the obligations of the Issuers, the
Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes
(‘‘Legal Defeasance’’). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuers will be deemed to have paid and
discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due;

(b) the Issuers’ obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes,
replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments
in respect of the Notes and segregate and hold such payments in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of either
Issuer, the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

79


-----

In addition, the Issuers and the Parent Guarantor may, at their option and at any time, elect to
have the obligations of the Issuers, the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors released with
respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’), and thereafter any
omission to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under
‘‘—Events of Default’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. These
events do not include events relating to non-payment, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and
reorganization. The Issuers and the Parent Guarantor may exercise their Legal Defeasance option
regardless of whether they previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in trust
with the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in pounds sterling
non-callable U.K. Government Securities, or a combination of cash in pounds sterling and
non-callable U.K. Government Securities, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion
of an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay and discharge
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, on the outstanding Notes on the Stated
Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuers or the
Parent Guarantor must (i) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a
particular redemption date; and (ii) if applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable
notice to redeem all of the outstanding Notes of such principal, premium, if any, or interest;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered to
the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that (x) the
Issuers have received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
a ruling, or (y) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal
income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm
that, the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered
to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that
the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing (i) on the date of such
deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be
applied to such deposit) or (ii) insofar as bankruptcy or insolvency events described in
clause (1)(h) of ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above is concerned, at any time during the period
ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit;

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee for the Notes to
have a conflicting interest as defined in the Indenture;

(f) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the
borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit), the Indenture or any material agreement or
instrument to which the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party or by which
the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary is bound;

80


-----

(g) such defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit
constituting an investment company within the meaning of the U.S. Investment Company Act
of 1940 unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt from registration
thereunder;

(h) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
independent counsel in the country of each Issuer or the Parent Guarantor’s incorporation to
the effect that after the 123rd day following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally and an opinion of independent counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee that the Trustee shall have a perfected security interest in such trust funds for the
ratable benefit of the holders of the Notes;

(i) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor with the intent
of preferring the holders of the Notes over the other creditors of the Issuers or the Parent
Guarantor with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the
Issuers, the Parent Guarantor or others, or removing assets beyond the reach of the relevant
creditors or increasing debts of the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor to the detriment of the
relevant creditors;

(j) no event or condition shall exist that would prevent the Issuers from making payments of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the date of such deposit or at any
time ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit; and

(k) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to
the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with.

If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when due because of any acceleration
occurring after an Event of Default, then the Issuers and the Guarantors will remain liable for such
payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued
thereunder (except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of such Notes as
expressly provided for in the Indenture), when:

(a) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with
the Trustee as funds in trust for such purpose an amount in cash in pounds sterling, U.K.
Government Securities, or a combination of cash in pounds sterling and U.K. Government
Securities, sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Debt on such Notes that have not, prior
to such time, been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any,
and any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes to the date of
such deposit (in the case of Notes which have become due and payable) or to the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be and the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor has
delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of such Notes at Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case
may be and either:

(i) all Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been

81


-----

deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuers and thereafter repaid to
the Issuers or discharged from such trust as provided for in the Indenture) have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become
due and payable (by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise),
(y) will become due and payable at Stated Maturity within one year or (z) are to be
called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the Issuers’ name, and at the Issuers’
expense;

(b) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other amounts payable
by the Issuers under the Indenture; and

(c) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an opinion of counsel, each stating that:

(i) all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of all Notes under the Indenture have been satisfied; and

(ii) such satisfaction and discharge will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, the Indenture or any other agreement or instrument governed by the laws
of the State of New York to which either Issuer or any Subsidiary is a party or by which
either Issuer or any Subsidiary is bound.

**Amendments and Waivers**

The Indenture will contain provisions permitting the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee to
enter into a supplemental indenture without the consent of the holders of the Notes for certain limited
purposes, including, among other things, curing ambiguities, defects or inconsistencies, or making any
change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of the Notes in any material respect.
With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee are permitted to amend or supplement
the Indenture; provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series
of the Notes, only the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required. However, no such modification or amendment
may, without the consent of the holders of 90% of the outstanding Notes (provided, however, that if any
amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the Notes, only the consent of
the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of such series shall be required (and not
the consent of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding)), with
respect to any such Notes held by a non-consenting holder:

(a) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of or Additional Amounts
or interest on, any Note;

(b) reduce the principal amount of any Note (or Additional Amounts or premium, if any) or the
rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(c) change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Note or any premium or any
Additional Amounts or the interest thereon is payable;

(d) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated
Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

(e) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment,
supplement or waiver of provisions of the Indenture;

82


-----

(f) modify any of the provisions relating to supplemental indentures requiring the consent of
holders of the Notes or relating to the waiver of past defaults or relating to the waiver of
certain covenants, except to increase the percentage of outstanding Notes required for such
actions or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or
waived without the consent of the holder of each Note affected thereby;

(g) make any change to the Intercreditor Agreement (and/or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or any provisions of the Indenture affecting the ranking of the Notes or the
Guarantees, in each case in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the holders of the
Notes; or

(h) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Additional Amounts’’
that adversely affects the rights of any holder of the Notes or amend the terms of the Notes
or the Indenture in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Issuers or the Guarantors agree to pay Additional Amounts
(if any) in respect thereof in the supplemental indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of the Notes, the Issuers, the
Guarantors and the Trustee may modify, amend or supplement the Indenture:

(i) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Parent Guarantor and the assumption by
any such successor of the provisions in the Indenture and in the Notes; provided that such
successor Person would have been permitted to so succeed in a transaction that would have
complied with the provisions of ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Consolidation Merger and Sale of
Assets’’; _provided, further, that such transaction need not be of a specific type identified in_
such covenant (it being understood that in the case of any other transaction, the
requirements of such covenant shall apply mutatis mutandis);

(ii) to add to the Issuers’ covenants and those of any Guarantor or any other obligor upon the
Notes for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Issuers or any Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Notes, as
applicable, in the Indenture, in the Notes or in any Guarantees;

(iii) to cure any ambiguity, or to correct or supplement any provision in the Indenture, the Notes
or any Guarantees that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision in the
Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantees or make any other provisions with respect to matters
or questions arising under the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantees; provided that, in each
case, such provisions shall not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes in any
material respect;

(iv) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees or the Notes to any provision of this
‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of the
Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the
Guarantees or the Notes;

(v) to release any Guarantor in accordance with and if permitted by the terms of and limitations
set forth in the Indenture and to add a Subsidiary Guarantor or other guarantor under the
Indenture (which will require execution of the relevant supplemental indenture only by the
Issuers, the Parent Guarantor and such additional Subsidiary Guarantor(s) or other
guarantor(s));

(vi) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the
Indenture;

83


-----

(vii) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Trustee for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes as additional security for the payment and performance of
the Issuers’ and any Guarantor’s obligations under the Indenture, in any property, or assets,
including any of which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
security interest is required to be granted to the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture or
otherwise; or

(viii) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with and if permitted by the
terms of and limitations set forth in the Indenture.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on
such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an opinion of counsel and an Officer’s Certificate.

The consent of the holders of the Notes will not be necessary under the Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment, waiver or consent. It is sufficient if such consent approves
the substance of the proposed amendment, waiver or consent. A consent to any amendment or waiver
under the Indenture by any holder of the Notes given in connection with a tender of such holder’s
Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

The Issuers will inform the Irish Stock Exchange of any material amendment to the Indenture or
any supplement thereto. The Issuers will also publish a notice of any such material amendment in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described immediately below under ‘‘—Notices.’’

**Notices**

Notices regarding the Notes will be:

(a) delivered to holders of the Notes electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage paid, and,
if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules and
regulation of such exchange so require, published in a newspaper having general circulation in
Ireland (which is expected to be The Irish Times or, to the extent and in the manner permitted
by the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange, posted on the official website of the Irish Stock
Exchange (www.ise.ie); and

(b) in the case of certificated Notes mailed to each Holder by first-class mail at such Holder’s
respective address as it appears on the registration books of the Registrar.

Notices given by first class mail will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing and notices
given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made.

**The Trustee**

The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee had written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are
set forth specifically in the Indenture. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from
taking any action enumerated in the Indenture are not construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from
responsibility, including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured
(including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the Parent Guarantor,
either Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor will have any liability for any obligations of the Parent
Guarantor, either Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Notes, any Guarantee or the Indenture

84


-----

or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each holder
by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York, and will provide for the submission of the parties to the
jurisdiction of the courts in the State of New York.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will be represented by a global note in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Notes’’). Notes sold to persons outside
the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by a global note
in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’). The
Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the ‘‘Global
Notes.’’

The Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the ‘‘Rule 144A Book-entry Interests’’) and
in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-entry Interests’’ and, together with the
Rule 144A Book-entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons who have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking or persons who hold interests through such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of
their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-entry Interests
will not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in the book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and their participants. The
laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The
foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-entry Interests. In addition,
while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-entry Interests will not be considered the owners
or ‘‘holders’’ of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking, as applicable
(or their respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream Banking, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream
Banking and the participants through which they own Book-entry Interests, to transfer their interests or
to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, nor the Registrar will have any
responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-entry Interests.

The articles of association of the Co-Issuers do not allow conversion of registered notes into notes
in bearer form.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream
Banking, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-entry Interests in such Global Note
from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption
price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-entry Interests will be equal to the
amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing
practices of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, if fewer than all of a series of Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will credit their respective participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis

108


-----

as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-entry Interest of less than £100,000
may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream
Banking, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary
procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever
nature, except as may be required by law and as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Additional Amounts.’’ If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent
described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts’’ we will pay additional amounts as
may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner
of Book-entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder
or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-entry Interest, as the
case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and
customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-entry Interests held
through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Co-Issuers and the Trustee will treat the registered holder
of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream Banking (or their respective nominees)) as the
owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of
the Co-Issuers, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents
has or will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records of Euroclear or Clearstream
Banking or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a
Book-entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or
Clearstream Banking or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on
account of, a Book-entry Interest, or Euroclear or Clearstream Banking or any participant or indirect
participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the
Global Notes, will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream
Banking in pounds sterling.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream Banking have advised the Co-Issuers that they will take any action
permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as
described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-entry
Interests are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream
Banking will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other
action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Indenture,
each of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for
definitive registered notes in certificated form (‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’) and to distribute
Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

109


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will be effected in
accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream Banking rules and will be settled in immediately available
funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to
sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such Notes,
such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes for Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will have a legend to the effect set forth
under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ Book-entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions
on transfers and certification requirements discussed under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the
Notes and the closing of the offering (the ‘‘Distribution Compliance Period’’), Regulation S Book-entry
Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A
Global Note only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the
Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the
meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and in accordance with
all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, Regulation S Book-entry Interests may
be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-entry Interest without
compliance with these certification requirements.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in
the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the
U.S. Securities Act).

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Notes and a corresponding increase in the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be
a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest in such
other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and
other procedures applicable to Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains
such a Book-entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes:

   - if Euroclear and Clearstream Banking notifies either Co-Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to
continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days;
or

   - if the owner of a Book-entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream Banking following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

110


-----

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered
Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the registrar or transfer agent. In the event of a
partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one
Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of
the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not
transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no
Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than £100,000 will be issued. We will bear the cost of
preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a
period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the applicable
series of Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the applicable series of Notes or (iii) the date
fixed for selection of the applicable series of Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required
to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption. In the event of the transfer
of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the applicable Indenture. We may
require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the applicable Indenture
and the applicable series of Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive
Registered Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is
mutilated and is surrendered to the registrar or at the office of the transfer agent, we will issue and the
Trustee, upon receipt of an authentication order, will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered
Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. Either Co-Issuer or the Trustee may require a
holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient
in the judgment of both to protect us, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent appointed pursuant to
the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced.
The Co-Issuers may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is
about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by either Co-Issuer
pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, such Co-Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a
new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case
may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first
delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Notice to
Investors.’’

So long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so
require, we will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having
general circulation in Ireland (which we expect to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the
manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange
(http://www.ise.ie).

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream Banking**

Our understanding with respect to the organization and operations of Euroclear and Clearstream
Banking is as follows. Euroclear and Clearstream Banking hold securities for participating
organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their
respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants.
Euroclear and Clearstream Banking provide various services to their participants, including the
safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded

111


-----

securities. Euroclear and Clearstream Banking interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream Banking participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers
and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and
Clearstream Banking is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream Banking
participant, either directly or indirectly.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, transfers of
interest in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream Banking will be effected
in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream Banking are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in
order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of Euroclear or
Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to
perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of the
Co-Issuers, the Trustee, the Registrar or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking or their respective participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

112


-----

**TAXATION**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax
consequences, under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes
including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on sale or
redemption of the Notes or any interest thereon.

**Ireland Taxation**

The following general summary describes the material Irish tax consequences of ownership of the
Notes and is based on the Irish tax law and published practice of the Revenue Commissioners as in
effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum and both are subject to change possibly with
retroactive effect. The following summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all Irish tax
considerations relating to the Notes. It relates to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial
owners of the Notes and may not apply to certain classes of persons such as financial institutions,
dealers and certain tax-exempt bodies. Holders of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax
advisers regarding the taxation implications of acquiring, owning and disposing of the Notes.

**_Taxation of the Irish Co-Issuer_**

The Irish Co-Issuer has elected to be taxable as a securitization company pursuant to Section 110
of the Irish Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended) (the ‘‘TCA 1997’’). Profits arising to the Irish
Co-Issuer shall be taxable at a rate of 25%. The rules applicable in order to calculate this tax are
generally the same as those applicable to a regular trading company except in relation to certain
payments of interest. Interest on the Notes would be deductible for Irish tax purposes, where certain
conditions are met.

All expenses that are not capital in nature and are wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the
Irish Co-Issuer’s activities and are not specifically prohibited by statute will be deductible from income
in order to determine taxable profits. Any losses incurred by the Irish Co-Issuer will be available for
set-off against its profits for any subsequent accounting period for so long as the Irish Co-Issuer
continues to be subject to the Section 110 taxation regime.

**_Withholding Tax on Interest_**

In general, withholding tax at the standard rate of tax (currently 20%) must be deducted from
Irish source interest payments made by an Irish company. However, for so long as the Notes are listed
on a recognized stock exchange such as the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange and
the Notes carry a right to interest, the Notes will constitute ‘‘quoted Eurobonds’’ and no withholding
for or on account of Irish income tax will be required to be made on interest arising on the Notes
under Section 64 of the TCA 1997.

There is no obligation to withhold tax on interest arising on quoted Eurobonds provided they meet
the following criteria:

(a) they are held in a recognized clearing system,

(b) the interest is paid by or through a person who is not in Ireland (‘‘non-Irish paying agent’’), or

(c) the beneficial owner of the Notes is not resident in Ireland and has made all necessary
declarations in the prescribed form.

As the Notes will constitute ‘‘quoted Eurobonds’’ and meet the above criteria, there will be no
requirement to withhold tax.

113


-----

There is also an exemption for interest paid by a qualifying company (within the meaning of
Section 110 of the TCA 1997) to a person who is resident in another EU Member State or a country
with which Ireland has a tax treaty, except in a case where the interest is paid to a company in relation
to a business which that company carries on in Ireland through a branch or agency. The Irish Co-Issuer
has applied to be treated as such a qualifying company.

No Irish withholding tax is payable in respect of a repayment of any principal amount of the
Notes. No Irish withholding tax is payable in respect of interest that does not have an Irish source and
does not arise to an Irish resident.

**_Charge to Irish Tax_**

Persons (individuals and companies) tax resident in Ireland are generally liable to Irish tax on their
worldwide income, including any income from the Notes.

In the case of persons that are individuals, interest will be liable to income tax at the marginal rate
(up to 40%). Such income will also be liable to the Universal Social Charge at rates of up to 11%
depending on the individual’s circumstances. Irish Social Security contributions may also be payable. In
the case of corporate entities, the rate of corporation tax applying to the interest income is 25% (unless
the income constitutes trading income).

Interest paid by an Irish resident company to persons resident outside Ireland and who are
resident in a ‘‘relevant territory’’ is exempt from Irish income tax where the Notes constitute ‘‘quoted
Eurobonds.’’ A ‘‘relevant territory’’ for this purpose is a Member State of the European Union (other
than Ireland), or a territory with which Ireland has entered into a double tax treaty.

Where interest is paid to or income, gains or discounts are realized by a person tax resident
outside a relevant territory, such Irish source income may be chargeable to Irish income tax. However,
a company (wherever resident) under the control of persons who are resident in a relevant territory
and not under the control of Irish residents should not be liable to Irish tax on interest arising on
quoted Eurobonds. A company (wherever resident) whose principal class of shares are quoted on a
recognized stock exchange is also not taxable on such interest on quoted Eurobonds. Ireland operates a
self-assessment system in respect of income taxes, corporation taxes, social insurance and the universal
social charge. Any person with Irish source income which is chargeable to Irish income tax comes
within the scope of that system and may have to file a return. A person not tax resident in Ireland
should not be liable to Irish tax on non-Irish source interest income.

**_Payments Under the Guarantee Arrangement_**

Any payments made by the Parent Guarantor under the Guarantee can be made without
deduction of Irish withholding tax where the Notes are quoted Eurobonds and meet the criteria set out
above.

Such payments should not be subject to Irish tax in the hands of a recipient who is not tax resident
in Ireland and is resident in a relevant territory and where the amount received is not connected with a
trade carried on in Ireland by the recipient through a branch or agency. Persons who are resident
outside a relevant territory and in receipt of such payments may be chargeable to Irish tax. Any such
person may come within the scope of the self-assessment system and may have to file a return.

**_Encashment Tax_**

If the Paying Agent is not in Ireland, which is the case, then there is no obligation to deduct
encashment tax. If a person in Ireland were to pay the interest or receive the interest on behalf of a
third-party, then Irish encashment tax (at the standard rate—currently 20%) would apply to amounts

114


-----

belonging to Irish resident holders of the Notes, or non-Irish residents who hold Notes and who had
not completed the requisite nonresident declaration forms.

In general, an automatic exemption from encashment tax exists on foreign dividends belonging to
the following Irish resident persons:

(a) approved charities,

(b) wholly exempt pension schemes,

(c) an Investment Undertaking within the meaning of Section 739B TCA 1997.

**_Deposit Interest Retention Tax_**

The interest on the Notes will not be liable to Deposit Interest Retention Tax.

**_Capital Gains Tax_**

In the case of a person who is either tax resident or ordinarily tax resident in Ireland, the disposal
or redemption of the Notes may be liable to Irish capital gains tax at a rate of 33%. If the person is
neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland, such person will not be liable to Irish capital gains
tax on the disposal or redemption unless the Notes are situated in Ireland and have been used in or for
the purposes of a trade carried on by such person in Ireland through a branch or agency, or which
were used or held or acquired for use by or for the purposes of the branch or agency. Registered
instruments will be deemed to be situated in Ireland if the register is located in Ireland at the time of
the disposal or redemption.

**_Capital Acquisitions Tax_**

A gift or inheritance of the Notes will be within the charge to capital acquisitions tax where the
donor or the beneficiary in relation to the gift/inheritance is tax resident or ordinarily tax resident in
Ireland on the date of the gift or inheritance, or if the Notes are regarded as property situated in
Ireland. Special rules with regard to tax residence apply where an individual is not domiciled in Ireland.
Capital acquisitions tax is charged at a rate of 33% on the taxable value of the gift or inheritance
above a tax-free threshold.

**_Value added Tax_**

There is no Irish Value added Tax (‘‘VAT’’) payable in respect of payments in consideration for the
issue of the Notes or for the transfer of a Note.

**_Stamp Duty_**

_Issuance of Instruments_

No stamp duty arises on the issuance of the Notes.

_Transfer of Notes_

No stamp duty is chargeable on a transfer of Notes as they meet the following conditions for
exemption under Irish tax legislation:

(i) they do not carry a right of conversion into stocks or marketable securities (other than loan
capital) of a company having a register in Ireland or into loan capital having such a right;

(ii) they do not carry rights of the same kind as shares in the capital of the company, including
rights such as voting rights, a share in the profits or a share in the surplus upon liquidation;

115


-----

(iii) they are issued for a price which is not less than 90% of the nominal value; and

(iv) they do not carry a right to a sum in respect of repayment or interest which is related to
certain movements in an index or indices specified in any instrument or other document
relating to such loan capital.

**_FATCA and the CRS_**

_FATCA_

The U.S. developed an intergovernmental approach to the implementation of FATCA (as discussed
in ‘‘—United States Federal Income Taxation—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act’’ below), which is
intended to reduce the burden for Financial Institutions (‘‘FIs’’) of complying with FATCA. The Irish
and U.S. governments signed an intergovernmental agreement (‘‘Irish IGA’’) on December 12, 2012.
Under the Irish IGA, information about relevant U.S. investors will be provided on an annual basis by
each Irish FI (unless the FI is exempted from the FATCA requirements) directly to the Irish Revenue
Commissioners, who will then provide such information to the U.S. tax authorities.

_CRS_

The Common Reporting Standard (‘‘CRS’’) requires participating jurisdictions to exchange certain
information held by financial institutions regarding their non-resident customers. Over 100 jurisdictions
have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and a group, including Ireland, have
committed to the early adoption of the CRS, with the first data exchanges taking place in September
2017. CRS does not impose any additional requirements to withhold tax on payments to investors.

_Reporting obligations under FATCA and the CRS_

A common feature of both FATCA and the CRS is that entities that are classified as ‘‘Financial
Institutions’’ are required to identify their investors and in certain circumstances report information to
their local tax authorities (for onward reporting to overseas tax authorities, in the case of CRS, and for
onward reporting to the U.S. tax authorities, in the case of FATCA).

The Irish Revenue Commissioners have issued regulations and guidance notes making compliance
with the Irish provisions implementing CRS and FATCA mandatory. As a result, Irish entities that are
classified as ‘‘Financial Institutions’’ in accordance with FATCA and CRS have obligations in respect of
the Irish law implementing CRS and FATCA.

On the basis that the Irish Co-Issuer does not fall within the definition of ‘‘Financial Institution’’
for FATCA and CRS purposes, it should not have any reporting obligations under FATCA or CRS.
However, there may be still FATCA or CRS reporting applicable to the Notes by persons other than
the Irish Co-Issuer but this will be dependent upon various factors such as the entities from which the
Noteholders will directly receive interest on the Notes, the rules applicable in the jurisdictions of these
entities, where the ultimate beneficial owners of the Notes are resident and their FATCA and CRS
status.

**United States Federal Income Taxation**

The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be
relevant with respect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes. This summary applies only
to holders who purchase Notes for cash in this offering at the applicable price indicated on the cover of
this Offering Memorandum and who will hold such notes as capital assets. It does not purport to be a
comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase
Notes. In particular, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that may
be subject to special tax rules including, without limitation, the following: (i) banks or other financial

116


-----

institutions; (ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in securities or currencies; (iv) tax-exempt
entities; (v) persons who will hold a Note as part of a ‘‘hedging’’ or ‘‘conversion’’ transaction or as a
position in a ‘‘straddle’’ or as part of a ‘‘synthetic security’’ or other integrated transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes; (vi) U.S. Holders (as defined below) who have a ‘‘functional currency’’
other than the U.S. dollar; (vii) regulated investment companies; (viii) partnerships and other
pass-through entities (and investors therein); and (ix) persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or
lawful permanent residents of the United States. Further, this summary does not address alternative
minimum tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax
consequences (such as, U.S. federal estate and gift tax consequences, or the Medicare tax on certain
investment income) or any U.S. state and local or foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning or
disposing of Notes.

This summary is based on the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. All of the foregoing are subject
to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described
below.

For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a
corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to
U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (1) a court within the United
States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust was in
existence on August 20, 1996 and has properly elected to continue to be treated as a U.S. person.

For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘Non-U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is neither
a U.S. Holder nor a partnership (or other entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes holds a Note, the tax treatment of a partner in or owner of the partnership or
other pass-through entity generally will depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the
activities of the entity. A person that is a partner in a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes that is considering investing in a Note should consult its own tax adviser.

Each prospective investor should consult its own tax adviser with respect to the U.S. federal
(including income, Medicare, estate and gift), state, local and foreign tax consequences, including under
tax treaties, of acquiring, owning and disposing of a Note. Holders should also review the discussion
under ‘‘—Ireland Taxation’’ for the Irish tax consequences to a holder of the ownership of the Notes.

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated principal on a
Note or retire the Notes before their stated maturity dates. Notwithstanding these possibilities, we do
not believe that the Notes are contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and, consequently, we do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment debt
instruments. If, notwithstanding our view, the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt
instruments, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally would be required to accrue
ordinary income at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate on such notes and to treat as ordinary
income (rather than capital gain) any gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of such
notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

117


-----

**_Source of Interest Payments_**

For certain U.S. federal income tax purposes (including for purposes of the foreign tax credit rules
and the withholding tax rules (including FATCA), as discussed below), the source of the interest
income received by a holder with respect to the Notes should depend on which issuer makes the
interest payment. However, the clearing systems require us to designate only one issuer for U.S. federal
withholding tax purposes, and we intend to designate Ardagh Holdings USA Inc. as the co-issuer of the
Notes for this purpose. As such, an applicable withholding agent likely will treat all interest payments
on the Notes as U.S. source for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes.

**_U.S. Holders_**

_Payments of Stated Interest_

Stated interest paid on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest
income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

With respect to the Note, a U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and who receives a payment of stated interest in pounds sterling (including a
payment attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest upon the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other disposition of the Note) will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value
of the pounds sterling payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date
the payment is received), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at that
time. A cash basis U.S. Holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of
stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of
the pounds sterling received.

With respect to the Note, a U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes will accrue sterling-denominated stated interest income in pounds
sterling and translate that amount into U.S. dollars based on the average spot rate of exchange in
effect for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the
average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within the applicable taxable year. Alternatively, an
accrual method U.S. Holder may elect to translate stated interest income received in pounds sterling
into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period (or, in the
case of a partial accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the last day of such partial accrual
period) or, if the date of receipt is within five business days of the last day of the interest accrual
period, the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A U.S. Holder that makes this election must
apply it consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot
change the election without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’).

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes
will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued sterling-denominated
stated interest income on the date the interest payment (or proceeds from a sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other disposition attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest) is
actually received. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the
difference between the U.S. dollar value of the pounds sterling payment received (determined based on
the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received) in respect of the accrual period and the
U.S. dollar value of stated interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined
above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency
gain or loss generally will be treated, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source ordinary
income or loss, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

118


-----

For most U.S. Holders, interest income with respect to Notes will constitute ‘‘passive category’’
income, which may be relevant in calculating the U.S. Holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. The rules
governing foreign tax credits are complex and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisers regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances.

_Disposition of Notes_

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S.
Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
realized on such disposition (except to the extent any amount realized is attributable to accrued but
unpaid stated interest, which is taxable as described under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’) and the
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the pounds sterling
paid for such Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase (which generally
should be the closing date). The amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of pounds sterling will generally be the U.S. dollar
value of such pounds sterling based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note is disposed of;
_provided, however, that if the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer_
(and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of such pounds sterling
on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described
above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and
cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If a Note is not traded on an established securities
market (or, if a Note is so traded, but a U.S. Holder is an accrual basis taxpayer that has not made the
settlement date election), a U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable
as ordinary income or loss not treated as interest income or expense) to the extent that the U.S. dollar
value of the pounds sterling received (based on the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date)
differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized.

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the Note, any
gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of a Note will be U.S. source capital gain or
loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one
year at the time of its disposition. For certain non-corporate holders (including individuals), any such
long-term capital gain is subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss
not treated as interest income or expense. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price
for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note is disposed of, and (ii) the
U.S. dollar value of the purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the
date the Note was acquired (or, in each case, determined on the settlement date if the Notes are
traded on an established securities market and the holder is either a cash basis or an electing accrual
basis holder). Payments received that are attributable to accrued interest will be treated in accordance
with the rules applicable to payments of interest described above. Any foreign currency exchange gain
or loss (including with respect to accrued interest) will be recognized only to the extent of the total
gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of the Note. Generally, the foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be U.S. source
ordinary income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.

119


-----

_Exchange of Foreign Currencies_

A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in any pounds sterling received as interest on the sale or other
disposition of a Note will be the U.S. dollar value of such pounds sterling at the spot rate of exchange
in effect on the date of receipt of the pounds sterling. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on
a sale, exchange or other disposition of the pounds sterling will be ordinary income or loss and
generally will be U.S. source income or loss not treated as interest income or expense for U.S. foreign
tax credit purposes.

_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_

U.S. Treasury regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions cover
certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an
individual or trust), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or of foreign currency received in respect of a foreign
currency note. Persons considering the purchase of the Notes should consult with their own tax advisers
to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Note or
the disposition of foreign currency, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable
Transaction Statement).

_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_

Certain U.S. Holders may be required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes,
subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for notes held in accounts maintained by certain
U.S. financial institutions). U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if
any, of this legislation on their ownership and disposition of the Notes including the significant
penalties for non-compliance with this requirement.

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments to U.S. Holders of
interest on the Notes and to the proceeds of a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition (including a
retirement or redemption) of a Note. Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) may be required
on such amounts if the U.S. Holder fails (i) to furnish the U.S. Holder’s taxpayer identification
number, (ii) to certify that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding as a result of a prior
failure to report interest or dividends or (iii) to otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of
the backup withholding rules. Certain exempt U.S. Holders (including, among others, corporations) are
not subject to the backup withholding and information reporting requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, provided that the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

_Payments of Stated Interest_

As discussed above under ‘‘—Source of Interest Payments,’’ an applicable withholding agent likely
will treat all payments on the Notes as U.S. source. Subject to the discussion of backup withholding
and FATCA below, to the extent that payments of interest on the Notes are treated as paid from U.S.
sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes, neither U.S. federal income tax nor the 30% U.S. federal

120


-----

withholding tax on U.S. source interest will apply to any payment of interest on a Note to a Non-U.S.
Holder provided that:

   - interest paid on a Note is not effectively connected with the Non U.S. Holder’s conduct of a
trade or business in the United States;

  - the Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined
voting power of all classes of Ardagh Holdings USA’s stock that are entitled to vote within the
meaning of section 871(h)(3) of the Code;

  - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank whose receipt of interest on a Note is described in
section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code;

  - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to Ardagh Holdings
USA (actually or constructively) through stock ownership; and

   - (1) the Non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address, and certifies, under penalties of perjury,
that it is not a U.S. person (which certification may be made on an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS
Form W-8BEN-E, or other applicable form) or (2) the Non-U.S. Holder holds the Note through
certain foreign intermediaries or certain foreign partnerships, and the Non-U.S. Holder and the
foreign intermediary or foreign partnership satisfies the certification requirements of applicable
U.S. Treasury regulations.

If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest (to the
extent treated as paid from U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will be subject to the
30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding
agent with a properly executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, (or other applicable
form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable
income tax treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) stating that interest paid on the
Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s
conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the
Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, then, although the Non-U.S.
Holder will be exempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax (provided the requirement to deliver
an IRS Form W-8ECI, or other appropriate IRS Form W-8, is satisfied), the Non-U.S. Holder will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis generally in the same manner
as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder unless an applicable income tax treaty provides
otherwise. In addition, if a Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, it may be subject to a branch profits tax
equal to 30% (or lesser rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the portion of its earnings and
profits for the taxable year, subject to adjustments, that are effectively connected with its conduct of a
trade or business in the United States.

_Disposition of Notes_

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, upon the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to
U.S. federal income tax or U.S. federal withholding tax on any gain recognized unless:

(1) that gain is effectively connected with a Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in
the United States; or

(2) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more
in the taxable year of that disposition and certain other conditions are met.

121


-----

If a Non-U.S. Holder is described in clause (1) above, it will be subject to tax on the net gain
derived from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (and possible
branch profits tax) in generally the same manner as discussed above with respect to effectively
connected interest. If a Non-U.S. Holder is an individual described in clause (2) above, such holder will
be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or
other taxable disposition, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (unless an applicable
income tax treaty provides otherwise).

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

Generally, the amount of U.S. source interest paid to Non-U.S. Holders and the amount of tax, if
any, withheld with respect to those payments must be reported annually to the IRS and to Non-U.S.
Holders. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest and withholding also may be made
available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions
of an applicable income tax treaty.

In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of
28%) with respect to payments of interest on the Notes, provided the statement described above in the
last bullet point under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’ has been received and the applicable
withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person,
as defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient. In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder will be
subject to information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding with respect
to payments of the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or
redemption) of a Note within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial
intermediaries, unless the statement described above has been received, and the applicable withholding
agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that a holder is a U.S. person, as defined
under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient, or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an
exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules from a payment to a Non-U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such Non-U.S.
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, _provided that_
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (such
sections and regulations commonly referred to as ‘‘FATCA’’), when applicable, will impose a U.S.
federal withholding tax of 30% on certain types of payments, including payments of U.S. source interest
and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of certain securities producing such U.S. source
interest made to (i) a ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for
the beneficial owner) unless such institution agrees to collect and disclose to the IRS information
regarding its direct and indirect U.S. account holders or (ii) a ‘‘non-financial foreign entity’’ (as the
beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner) unless such entity certifies that it does
not have any ‘‘substantial United States owners’’ (as defined in the Code) or furnish identifying
information regarding each substantial United States owner (generally by providing an IRS
Form W-8BEN-E). In certain circumstances, the relevant foreign financial institution or non-financial
foreign entity may qualify for an exemption from these rules, which exemption is typically evidenced by
providing appropriate documentation (such as an IRS Form W-8BEN-E). In addition, an
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the jurisdiction of a foreign financial
institution may modify these rules.

The withholding obligations described above generally will apply to payments of interest on the
Notes, and to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the Notes occurring on or
after January 1, 2019. You are urged to consult your own tax advisers regarding FATCA and the
application of these requirements to your investment in the Notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Barclays Bank PLC and Credit Suisse Securities (Europe)
Limited are the Initial Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase
agreement dated the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Initial Purchasers have severally agreed to
purchase, and we have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, the principal amount of Notes set forth
in the purchase agreement.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the
Notes are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The Initial
Purchasers must purchase all of the Notes if they purchase any of Notes.

The Initial Purchasers propose to resell the Notes at the offering prices set forth on the cover page
of this Offering Memorandum within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to
non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. The price at which the Notes
are offered may be changed at any time without notice.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for
the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt
from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. See ‘‘Notice to
Investors.’’

The Initial Purchasers may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of the
Notes, as applicable, in jurisdictions in which they are otherwise not permitted.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of the Notes
within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with
Rule 144A.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

(i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by them in connection with the issuance or sale
of the Notes, as applicable, in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not
apply to the Co-Issuers or any Guarantor; and

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by them in relation to the Notes, as applicable, in, from or otherwise involving
the United Kingdom.

Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about June 12, 2017, which will
be the sixth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to
as ‘‘T+6’’). Under Rule 15-c61 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the day of pricing or the succeeding two
business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle in T+6 to specify
an alternate settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the
Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the day of pricing or the next succeeding four business days
should consult their own advisers.

Application will be made for listing particulars to be approved by the Irish Stock Exchange and for
the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on its
Global Exchange Market. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the

123


-----

market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading
market for the Notes will continue after this offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they
currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and they
may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time without notice. In
addition, market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act and may be
limited. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that you will be able to sell the Notes at a particular time
or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable.

In connection with this offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than us and
will not be responsible to anyone other than us for providing the protections afforded to their clients or
for providing advice in relation to this offering.

Buyers of the Notes sold by the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the initial
offering price set forth on the cover of this Offering Memorandum.

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open
market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short
positions and stabilizing purchases.

   - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of notes
than it is required to purchase in the offering.

   - Covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market after the distribution has
been completed in order to cover short positions.

   - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not
exceed a specified maximum.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the
Initial Purchasers for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in
the market price of the Notes. They may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price
that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The Initial
Purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the Initial
Purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The Initial Purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may
include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers
and their respective affiliates have in the past, and may in the future, perform commercial banking,
investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received
customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with
and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive
customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business
activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for
the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities
and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and instruments.
The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes.

Affiliates of Citigroup Global Markets Limited serve as trustee under the Existing Notes, security
agent under the Existing Secured Notes and administrative agent under the Credit Agreement, and
have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
One or more of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates, as applicable, are or will be hedging

124


-----

counterparties with Ardagh. Typically, such Initial Purchasers or their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or
the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. An affiliate of one Initial
Purchaser also provides the Bank of America Facility. The Initial Purchasers hold or in the future may
hold certain of the Existing Notes to be repurchased with a portion of the proceeds of this offering and
as a result may receive proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, in their capacities as holders of such

(10) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, any offer or sale

to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing
acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

**Notice to Investors in the European Economic Area**

In relation to each member state of the European Economic Area which has implemented the
Prospectus Directive (each, a ‘‘Relevant Member State’’), each Initial Purchaser has represented and
agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented
in that Relevant Member State it has not made and will not make an offer of Notes which are the
subject of the offering contemplated by this Offering Memorandum to the public in that Relevant
Member State other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a ‘‘qualified investor’’ as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

129


-----

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than ‘‘qualified investors’’ as defined in the
Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the
prior consent of the Initial Purchasers nominated by the Co-Issuers for any such offer; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,

_provided that no such offer of Notes shall require the Co-Issuers, Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers_
to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus
pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an ‘‘offer of Notes to the public’’ in relation to
any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of
sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor
to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any
measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression ‘‘Prospectus
Directive’’ means Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, including by Directive 2010/73/EC) and includes
any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State.

**LEGAL MATTERS**

Certain legal matters with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees are being passed upon for us
by Shearman & Sterling (London) LLP, U.S. federal and New York counsel to the Co-Issuers and
Guarantors, and William Fry, Irish counsel to the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors. Certain legal matters
with respect to the offering of the Notes will be passed upon for the Initial Purchasers by Cahill
Gordon & Reindel (UK) LLP, U.S. federal and New York counsel to the Initial Purchasers, and
McCann Fitzgerald, Irish counsel to the Initial Purchasers.

**INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS**

The audited consolidated financial statements of Ardagh Group S.A. and its subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for each of the three financial years ended December 31, 2016 have
been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Dublin, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report incorporated herein. The audited financial statements of the Ball Carve-Out
Business as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the three financial years ended
December 31, 2015 have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, as
stated in their report incorporated herein. The audited financial statements of the Rexam Carve-Out
Business as of and for the three financial years ended December 31, 2015 have been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, as stated in their report incorporated herein.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

Ardagh Packaging Finance, one of the Co-Issuers of the Notes, is incorporated under the laws of
Ireland, and the Parent Guarantor of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Upon
issuance, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and on or prior to the date required by
the Indenture, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Subsidiary
Guarantors. The Parent Guarantor and most of the Subsidiary Guarantors are incorporated under the
laws of one of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of
the Co-Issuers and such Guarantors live outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of
Ardagh Packaging Finance and the Guarantors (other than the Subsidiary Guarantors in Delaware
(United States)), and substantially all of the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons
in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil
liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. In addition, local counsel have informed
us that it is questionable whether a foreign court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if
proceedings were commenced predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against any Co-Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, any
Subsidiary Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to
enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. We have
been advised by counsel that there is doubt that a lawsuit based upon United States federal or state
securities laws could be brought in an original action in such foreign jurisdictions and that a foreign
judgment based upon United States federal or state securities laws would be enforced in such
jurisdictions. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not based on United States federal or
state securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in such countries. You should consult with
your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or
elsewhere outside the United States.

The statute of limitations applicable to payment of interest and repayment of principal under New
York law is six years.
