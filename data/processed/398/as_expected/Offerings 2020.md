whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation
of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
solicitation or sale would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering and sale of the securities
be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchaser (as defined in the attached Offering

defined in the attached Offering Memorandum) in such jurisdiction.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that
documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic
transmission and consequently neither the Initial Purchaser nor any person who controls it nor any

This document does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to sell these securities or any
solicitation of any offer to purchase these securities in any jurisdiction where such offer or sale is not

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA and United Kingdom Retail Investors—The Notes are not intended to be**
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to
any retail investor in the European Economic Area (‘‘EEA’’) or the United Kingdom (‘‘UK’’). For these
purposes (a) a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; and (b) the
expression ‘‘offered’’ includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information
on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or
subscribe for the Notes. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the UK has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the UK may
be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to
the UK, those Regulations or Directives as they form part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have been implemented in UK domestic law, as appropriate.

The information in the Offering Memorandum is not complete and may be changed.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **CONFIDENTIAL**
**NOT FOR GENERAL CIRCULATION**
**IN THE UNITED STATES**

# Ardagh Packaging Finance plc and Ardagh Holdings USA Inc.


21SEP201018550902


### $500,000,000 % Senior Secured Notes due 2025
**guaranteed on a senior basis by Ardagh Group S.A. and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries**


The $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured Notes due 2025 offered hereby (the ‘‘Notes’’)
will be issued by Ardagh Packaging Finance plc (‘‘Ardagh Packaging Finance’’) and Ardagh Holdings USA Inc. (‘‘Ardagh
Holdings USA’’ and, together with Ardagh Packaging Finance, the ‘‘Issuers’’) jointly and severally as co-issuers.

The Notes will bear interest at the rate of % per annum. Interest will be paid on the Notes semi-annually in
arrears on April 30 and October 30 of each year, beginning on October 30, 2020. The Notes will mature on April 30, 2025.
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date.

The Issuers may redeem the Notes in whole or in part on or after April 30, 2022 at the redemption prices specified
herein. Prior to April 30, 2022 we may also redeem the Notes by paying a ‘‘make-whole’’ premium. In addition, prior to
April 30, 2022 we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from
certain public equity offerings. The redemption prices are discussed under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional
Redemption.’’ In the event of a Change of Control (as defined herein), we must make an offer to purchase the Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the ‘‘Parent Guarantee’’) by Ardagh Group S.A.
(the ‘‘Parent Guarantor’’). Subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein), the Parent Guarantor shall be
required to ensure that the Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis (the ‘‘Subsidiary Guarantees’’ and, together with the
Parent Guarantee, the ‘‘Guarantees’’) by all subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (other than the Issuers) that guarantee
the Existing Notes, within 90 days following the Issue Date, or upon delivery of an officer’s certificate to the Trustee
stating that in the good faith determination of the Issuers the outbreak of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread
has made it impracticable to incur and perfect such security interests, 120 days following the Issue Date.

Currently, there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made for listing particulars to be approved by
Euronext Dublin and for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its
Global Exchange Market. There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Global
Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin. The Global Exchange Market is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID
II.

**Investing in the Notes involves risks. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ beginning on page 12.**


The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the ‘‘U.S. Securities Act’’), or any state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered and sold only
to qualified institutional buyers (‘‘QIBs’’) in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’) and
outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act
(‘‘Regulation S’’). Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes may be relying on
the exemption from the registration requirements under the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.

The Notes will be issued in the form of global notes in registered form. See ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.’’


**Price of the Notes:** **% plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date**


The Initial Purchaser expects to deliver the Notes to purchasers on or about, 2020 (the ‘‘Issue Date’’).

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

**Issuers**

Ardagh Packaging Finance, the co-issuer of the Notes, is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the
Parent Guarantor. Ardagh Packaging Finance was incorporated and registered in Ireland as a public
limited company on September 17, 2010. Ardagh Packaging Finance is a finance company. It is the
co-issuer of the Existing Notes and the Notes offered hereby.

Ardagh Holdings USA, the co-issuer of the Notes, is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the
Parent Guarantor. Ardagh Holdings USA was incorporated in Delaware on February 20, 2009. It is the
co-issuer of the Existing Notes and the Notes offered hereby

**The Parent Guarantor**

The Parent Guarantor was incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg on May 6, 2011 and is a
subsidiary of ARD Holdings. Except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated,
all references to ‘‘Ardagh,’’ ‘‘Ardagh Group,’’ ‘‘Group,’’ the ‘‘Company,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us’’ and ‘‘our’’ refer to the
Parent Guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries. In this Offering Memorandum, we present
consolidated financial information for the Parent Guarantor.

**Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum incorporates by reference the audited consolidated financial statements
of Ardagh Group S.A. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2019 prepared in accordance with IFRS (the ‘‘Audited Annual
Consolidated Financial Statements’’).

The Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements of Ardagh Group S.A. incorporated by
reference in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS in effect as of
December 31, 2019. In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of
Ardagh, the terms of the offering of the Notes and the financial information contained in and incorporated
by reference in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional advisers for an
understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences could affect the
financial information contained in and incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the
financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements for Ardagh Group S.A. have been prepared based on a
calendar year and are presented in U.S. dollars rounded to the nearest million. Therefore, discrepancies in
the tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may occur due to such rounding.

Unless stated otherwise, debt balances are presented before deducting deferred financing costs.

**Pro Forma Financial Data**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain pro forma financial data in respect of pro forma net
interest expense, pro forma net debt, the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma net interest expense and
the ratio of pro forma net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019
reflecting the impact of (i) savings resulting from the repayment of certain notes during the year ended
December 31, 2019, (ii) the impact after giving effect to the Credit Facility (as defined below), and (iii) the

xi


-----

impact after giving effect to the Offering. This unaudited pro forma financial data is based on available
information and various assumptions that management believes to be reasonable.

The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in such unaudited pro forma financial
data for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to
prepare the unaudited pro forma combined financial data and actual amounts. The unaudited pro forma
financial data is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual
results would have been had the Offering and the use of proceeds thereof occurred on the dates assumed,
nor is it necessarily indicative of future results or financial position. This unaudited pro forma financial
data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the US
Exchange Act or US GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial data has been
audited or reviewed in accordance with standards of the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(‘‘PCAOB’’).

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

We present in this Offering Memorandum Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Net Debt,
Working Capital and related ratios, which are supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity
that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’ as profit
before tax, net finance expense, depreciation and amortization and exceptional operating items, ‘‘Adjusted
EBITDA margin’’ as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue, ‘‘Net Debt’’ as total borrowings, plus
premium on debt issuance above par and the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments, less
cash and cash equivalents and deferred debt issuance costs and ‘‘Working Capital’’ as inventories, trade
and other receivables, contract assets, trade and other payables and current provisions.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Net Debt, Working Capital and related ratios should
not be considered in isolation and are not measures of our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS
and U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period or any other
performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from operating,
investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity as derived in accordance with IFRS. These
non-IFRS and non-GAAP financial measures do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be
sufficient or available for cash requirements and may not be indicative of our results of operations. In
addition, such measures, as we define them, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used
by other companies.

**Industry and Market Data**

**_Metal Beverage Packaging_**

Given the specialized nature of the metal packaging markets in which Metal Beverage Packaging
operates, there does not exist a relevant and reliable third-party source of much of the applicable market
information incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. Therefore, estimates provided by
Metal Beverage Packaging regarding these markets, as well as estimated market shares of Metal Beverage
Packaging or its competitors, are largely based on Metal Beverage Packaging’s knowledge of these
markets, developed primarily from analysis of public information, third-party reports to the extent
available, competitors’ public announcements and regulatory filings and information gathered in the
course of acquisitions. The data relating to market sizes, market share and market position are based on
the most recent data available. This information has not been confirmed by an independent organization,
nor can there be assurance that third parties would arrive at the same results were they to employ different
methods for gathering, analyzing and calculating such data. Breakdowns of market shares were established
on the basis of Metal Beverage Packaging’s consolidated revenues and these data. Market positions and
percentage shares are those that Metal Beverage Packaging believes it holds in terms of revenues. They are
based on industry market sectors on which Metal Beverage Packaging’s group business is arranged.

xii


-----

Certain additional information regarding the global packaging industry, generally, and the metal can
packaging sector, specifically, has been sourced from Smithers Pira.

Any third-party information described above and incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum has been accurately reproduced and as far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from
the information published by such third parties, the reproduced information is accurate and no facts have
been omitted which would render such information inaccurate or misleading. Market share data is subject
to change, however, and such third-party information has been prepared for statistical and other
informational purposes, which is limited by the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature
of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey of
market share.

**_Glass Packaging_**

We have used industry and market data obtained from independent industry publications, market
research, internal surveys and other publicly available information. In particular, we have obtained
information or other statements incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum relating to
market share and industry data relating to our business from providers of industry data, including the
British Glass Manufacturers Confederation, Fachvereinigung Beh¨alterglasindustrie e.V. (Germany),
Forum Opakowan Szklanych (Poland) and the European Container Glass Federation (‘‘FEVE’’).

Industry publications generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources
believed to be reliable but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We
have not independently verified such data. Similarly, while we believe that our internal surveys are reliable,
they have not been verified by independent sources and we cannot assure you of their accuracy.

Moreover, information and quantitative statements regarding our market position relative to our
competitors are not based on published statistical data or information obtained from third parties. Rather,
such information and statements reflect our best estimates based upon our internal records and surveys,
statistics published by providers of industry data, information published by our competitors, and
information obtained from trade and business organizations and associations and other sources within the
industry in which we operate. We believe that such data are useful in helping investors understand the
industry in which we operate and our position within the industry. However, we do not have access to the
facts and assumptions underlying the numerical data and other information extracted from publicly
available sources and have not independently verified any data provided by third parties or industry or
general publications. In addition, while we believe our internal data and surveys to be reliable, such data
and surveys have not been verified by any independent sources.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference herein) includes
statements that are, or may be deemed to be, ‘‘forward-looking statements’’ within the meaning of the
securities laws of certain jurisdictions, statements of future expectations and other forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such
as ‘‘aim,’’ ‘‘anticipate,’’ ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘continue,’’ ‘‘could,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’ ‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘forecast,’’ ‘‘guidance,’’
‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘plan,’’ ‘‘potential,’’ ‘‘predict,’’ ‘‘projected,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘suggests,’’ ‘‘targets,’’ ‘‘will’’ or
‘‘would’’ or similar expressions or the negatives thereof, or other variations thereof, or comparable
terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. These forward-looking statements include
all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering
Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference herein) and include statements regarding
our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, amongst other things, our results of operations,
financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate.

We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that
our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in
which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements
contained in this Offering Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference herein). In
addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the
industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering
Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference herein), those results or developments
may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the
future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. The development of the industry in which we operate, may
differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking
statements contained (or incorporated by reference) in this Offering Memorandum.

These statements are based on management’s current views and assumptions and involve known and
unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially
from those anticipated by such statements. Factors that could cause such differences in actual results
include, among others:

   - the risk factors incorporated herein by reference to the Form 20-F; and

   - risks related to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (‘‘COVID-19’’).

We undertake no obligations to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Offering Memorandum or to reflect the
occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law.

The foregoing factors and others described under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ or incorporated by reference herein
should not be construed as exhaustive. There are other factors that may cause our actual results to differ
materially from the forward-looking statements contained (or incorporated by reference) in this Offering
Memorandum. Moreover, new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all
such risks. We cannot assess the impact of all risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results. We urge you to read the sections of this Offering
Memorandum or incorporated by reference herein entitled ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and ‘‘Operating and Financial
Review and Prospects’’ which are incorporated by reference herein for a more complete discussion of the
factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we operate.

-----

The forward-looking statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently
available to our management, and we undertake no obligation, and do not expect, to publicly update or
publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons
acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above
and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference
herein).

**SUMMARY**

**Overview**

For information relating to the Group and its business, please refer to the Form 20-F filed by Ardagh
Group S.A. with the SEC on February 27, 2020.

**Trading Update**

We expect to report Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 in line with our guidance of
$270 million, with no material impact from the recent outbreak of COVID-19 during the quarter.

Overall demand has remained resilient to date, reflecting our focus on the beverage and food end use
categories. Operationally, we are a core part of the supply chain and all our production facilities have
continued to operate normally. Our supply chains have also continued to function satisfactorily to date.

We ended the quarter with total cash and committed liquidity of $1.1 billion, including approximately
$950 million in cash on hand. This includes proceeds from the Credit Facility (as defined below), drawn in
full on March 23, 2020, and does not include proceeds of the Offering. Pro forma for the Offering, total
cash and committed liquidity would increase to $1.3 billion, including approximately $1.15 billion in cash.

_The above information is based on preliminary results and estimates and is not intended to be a_
_comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for the first quarter of 2020. Such preliminary_
_information has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, our management. The preliminary results_
_mentioned above are derived from our management accounts, rather than our unaudited interim financial_
_information, which will be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our preliminary estimates are based on a_
_number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. In addition, while we_
_believe these estimates to be reasonable, our actual results may vary from our preliminary results and estimates_
_above, and such variations could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on them. See_
_‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that_
_could affect our future performance and results of operations._

**Recent Developments**

**_COVID-19_**

The outbreak of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel,
imposition of quarantines and prolonged closures of workplaces and other businesses, including
hospitality, leisure and entertainment outlets, and the related cancellation of events, may impact our
business in a number of ways. This is expected to include an adverse effect from reduced global economic
activity and resulting demand for our customers’ products and, therefore, the products we manufacture. It
may also adversely affect our ability to operate our business, including potential disruptions to our supply
chain and workforce. The COVID-19 impact on capital markets could also impact our cost of borrowing.

Although it is currently too early to estimate, we expect the ultimate significance of the impact of
these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will
be determined by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the
duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in
response to the pandemic.

See ‘‘Risk Factors—The outbreak of COVID-19 may have a negative impact on worldwide economic
activity and our business.’’

**_Credit Facility_**

On March 20, 2020, a credit agreement was entered into among, inter alios, the Issuers as borrowers
(the ‘‘Borrowers’’), the Parent Guarantor as parent guarantor, the other guarantors from time to time
party thereto, and the lending institutions from time to time party thereto (the ‘‘Lenders’’), Citibank, N.A.
as administrative agent and Citibank, N.A., London Branch as security agent, pursuant to which the
Lenders extended credit to the Borrowers in the form of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of
$300,000,000 (the ‘‘Credit Facility’’). We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the
Notes to repay the Credit Facility in full.

**SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA OF ARDAGH GROUP S.A.**

The following table sets forth summary financial data and other data for Ardagh for the years ended
and as of the dates indicated below. The summary historical financial data as of December 31, 2019 and
2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 has been derived from the
Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum. The balance sheet information as of December 31, 2017 has been derived from audited
consolidated financial statements of Ardagh Group S.A. not included or incorporated by reference in this
Offering Memorandum.

The summary financial data and other data should be read in conjunction with Item 5 ‘‘Operating and
Financial Review’’ in the Form 20-F and the Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and
related notes, both incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. Historical results are not
necessarily indicative of future expected results.

On October 31, 2019, the Group completed the combination of its Food & Specialty Metal Packaging
business with the metal packaging business of the Exal group, to form Trivium Packaging B.V., a global
leader in metal packaging (the ‘‘Disposition’’). As a result of the completion of the Disposition, the
Food & Specialty Metal Packaging business has been reported as a discontinued operation. As required,
the income statement information for the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 has been
restated retrospectively in accordance with IFRS 5—Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued
operations, to present the results of the continuing operations of the Group. The Group holds
approximately 42% of the ordinary shares of Trivium Packaging B.V. As the Group jointly controls both the
financial and operating policy decisions of Trivium Packaging B.V., the investment is accounted for as a
joint venture under the equity method.

The pro forma financial data in respect of pro forma net interest expense, pro forma net debt, ratio of
Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma net interest expense and ratio of pro forma net debt to Adjusted EBITDA
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 presented and described in the notes thereto reflects the
impact of (i) savings resulting from the repayment of certain notes during the year ended December 31,
2019, (ii) the impact after giving effect to the Credit Facility, and (iii) the impact after giving effect to the
Offering. This unaudited pro forma financial data is based on available information and various
assumptions that management believes to be reasonable.

This unaudited pro forma financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of Regulation S-X under the US Exchange Act or US GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro
forma financial data has been audited or reviewed in accordance with standards of the US Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (‘‘PCAOB’’).

For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Audited Annual
Consolidated Financial Statements, please see Note 2 ‘‘Summary of significant accounting policies’’ to the
Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference into this Offering
Memorandum.

For further details on the exceptional operating items for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, see Note 4 to the
Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum.

(2) Net interest expense represents net finance expense excluding exceptional finance items, net interest cost on net pension plan
liabilities, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges, and other finance
expenses. Included in net finance expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 is $203 million of exceptional finance expense,
primarily debt refinancing and settlement costs related to the $1,650 million Senior Notes repaid in August, 2019 and the

10


-----

$1,000 million Senior Secured Notes, A440 million Senior Secured Notes and A750 million Senior Notes repaid in November,
2019.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA consists of profit/(loss) before income tax expense/(credit), net finance expense, depreciation and
amortization, exceptional operating items and share of profit or loss in equity accounted joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA
margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are presented
because we believe that they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating
companies in the packaging industry. However, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
margin in a manner different from ours. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of financial
performance under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to profit/(loss) as indicators of operating performance or
any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

The reconciliation of loss for the year to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

_and we may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part_
_of your investment. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm_
_us and affect your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that_
_might cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See_
_‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’_

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

_Please also see the risks relating to our business incorporated by reference herein from Item 3.D in the_
_Form 20-F._

**_The outbreak of COVID-19 may have a negative impact on worldwide economic activity and our business._**

The outbreak of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel,
imposition of quarantines and prolonged closures of workplaces and other businesses, including
hospitality, leisure and entertainment outlets, and the related cancellation of events, will impact our
business in a number of ways.

This is expected to include an adverse effect from reduced global economic activity and resulting
demand for our customers’ products and, therefore, the products we manufacture. It may also adversely
affect our ability to operate our business, including potential disruptions to our supply chain and
workforce. Although our plants are currently operational and have been to date, they may in the future be
required to curtail or cease production in response to the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 impact on
capital markets could also impact our cost of borrowing. In addition, our customers, distribution partners,
service providers or suppliers may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of
business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the outbreak of COVID-19 which would have a
negative impact on our business. At this point, the extent of the impact on our results as a result of the
outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain.

Although it is currently too early to estimate, we expect the ultimate significance of the impact of
these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will
be determined by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the
duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in
response to the pandemic.

It is expected that the continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown and
potentially a recession or depression which would adversely affect the demand for our products or cause
other unpredictable events, each of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition. Any future epidemics may also have similar, or more severe, effects on global
economic activity and on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under_**
**_the Notes._**

We have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. As of December 31,
2019, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would
have had (i) total debt of $6,442 million, of which $500 million would have been debt incurred in this
offering and (ii) $3,621 million of debt which will mature prior to the maturity of the Notes. As of
December 31, 2019, we had additional availability under our main credit facilities of up to $664 million,
and all of these borrowings would effectively rank senior to the Notes. Our indirect parent ARD Finance
has $1,130 million and A1,000 million aggregate principal amount of Toggle Notes outstanding and is
dependent on dividends from us to service the Toggle Notes.

Our substantial debt could have important negative consequences for us and for you as a holder of the
Notes. For example, our substantial debt could:

   - require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and fund
repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital,
capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

   - increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;

   - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which
we operate;

   - limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future;

   - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

   - make it difficult for us to pay interest or principal on the Notes and our other debt; and

  - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

In addition, a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market
interest rates. Although we may hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates by entering into
interest rate swaps, we cannot assure you that we will do so in the future. As a result, an increase in market
interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations, which would exacerbate
the risks associated with our leveraged capital structure.

Negative developments in our business, results of operations and financial condition due to the
current difficult global economic conditions or other factors could cause the ratings agencies to lower the
credit ratings, or ratings outlook, of our short- and long-term debt and, consequently, impair our ability to
raise new financing or refinance our current borrowings and increase our costs of issuing any new debt
instruments.

**_Certain of our credit facilities contain financial covenants which we could fail to meet._**

Certain of our existing credit facilities require, in certain circumstances, and our future credit facilities
may require, the Parent Guarantor and certain of its subsidiaries to satisfy specified financial tests and
maintain specified financial ratios and covenants, all as defined in such credit facilities. See ‘‘Description of
Other Indebtedness.’’

The ability of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these ratios and to meet these
tests (if these requirements arise) could be affected by events beyond their control and we cannot assure
you that they would continue to meet these tests. The failure of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries
to comply with these obligations (if they arise) could lead to a default under these credit facilities unless we
could obtain waivers or consents in respect of any breaches of these obligations under these credit

13


-----

facilities. We cannot assure you that these waivers or consents would be granted. A breach of any of these
covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under these
credit facilities. In the event of any default under these credit facilities, the lenders under these facilities
would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us or our operating subsidiaries and could elect to
declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, fees and other amounts due thereunder,
to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our credit facilities, the Existing Notes or the Notes
were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay such debt in full.

**_We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt._**

Subject to the restrictions in our credit facilities, the Indenture, the Existing Indentures and other
outstanding debt, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could also be
secured.

As of December 31, 2019, on a historical basis, we had additional availability under our main credit
facilities of up to $664 million. Although the terms of these credit facilities, the Indenture and the Existing
Indentures and other outstanding debt contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these
restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and debt incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our currently
anticipated debt levels, the substantial leverage-related risks described above would increase.

**_Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate cash_**
**_required to service our debt._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on the Notes and to meet our other debt service obligations
or refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate
cash. This will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as general
economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, technical and other factors beyond our control. If we cannot
generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other business needs, we may,
among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, obtain additional
financing, delay planned acquisitions or capital expenditures or sell assets. There can be no assurances that
we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of the foregoing. If we are not able to refinance any
of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may
not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including the Notes.

We expect to be able to repay or refinance the principal amounts outstanding under our outstanding
notes (including the Notes) upon maturity of each such series of notes between 2022 and 2027. We may,
however, be unable to repay or refinance such principal amounts on terms satisfactory to us or at all.

**_Restrictions imposed by the Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the ABL Facility and certain of our other credit_**
**_facilities limit our ability to take certain actions._**

The Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the ABL Facility and certain of our other credit facilities limit
our flexibility in operating our business. For example, these agreements restrict or limit the ability of the
Parent Guarantor and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - borrow money;

   - pay dividends or make other distributions;

   - create certain liens;

   - make certain asset dispositions;

  - make certain loans or investments;

14


-----

   - issue or sell share capital of our subsidiaries;

  - guarantee indebtedness;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates; or

   - merge, consolidate or sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

There can be no assurances that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the
Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the ABL Facility and certain of our other credit facilities will not
adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business
activities that may be in our interest. Any future indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive
terms. In addition, the management believes that the future expansion of our packaging business is likely
to require participation in the consolidation of the packaging industry by the further acquisition of existing
businesses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to participate in such consolidation or that the
operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the ABL
Facility and certain of our other credit facilities will permit us to do so.

In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, a breach of the covenants in the
Indenture could cause a default under the terms of our other financing agreements, including the ABL
Facility, causing all the debt under those agreements to be accelerated. If this were to occur, we can make
no assurances that we would have sufficient assets to repay our debt.

**_We may be unable to repurchase the Notes as required upon a Change of Control._**

If we experience a Change of Control, we would be required to make an offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
of repurchase. However, we may be unable to do so because we might not have enough available funds,
particularly since a Change of Control could in certain circumstances cause part or all of our other debt to
become due and payable. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control.’’

**_The insolvency laws of Ireland, Luxembourg and other local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S._**
**_bankruptcy laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar._**

Ardagh Packaging Finance, the co-issuer of the Notes is incorporated in Ireland, the Parent
Guarantor is incorporated in Luxembourg, and Ardagh Holdings USA, the co-issuer of the Notes, is
incorporated in the State of Delaware (United States). Most of the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Notes are
incorporated under the laws of a number of different jurisdictions outside the United States. The
insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers,
the Guarantors or any other of Ardagh Group S.A.’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**_The Issuers’ ability to pay principal and interest on the Notes may be affected by our organizational structure. The_**
**_Issuers are dependent upon payments from other members of our corporate group to fund payments to you on the_**
**_Notes, and such other members might not be able to make such payments in some circumstances._**

The Issuers do not themselves conduct any business operations and do not have any assets or sources
of income of their own, other than the intercompany notes made to on-lend the net proceeds from the
offering of the Notes as described below. As a result, the Issuers’ ability to make payments on the Notes is
dependent directly upon interest or other payments they receive from other members of our corporate
group. Initially, the proceeds of the Notes will be loaned to other members of our corporate group
pursuant to intercompany notes. These intercompany notes may be subordinated to senior debt of the
relevant intercompany borrowers. The Indenture does not require the maintenance of these intercompany

15


-----

notes. Accordingly, you should only rely on the Guarantees of the Notes, and not these intercompany
notes, to provide credit support in respect of payments of principal or interest on the Notes. The ability of
other members of our corporate group to make payments to the Issuers will depend upon their cash flows
and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors’’ or those
risk factors incorporated by reference herein.

Furthermore, some of our credit facilities contain certain restrictions on the borrowers thereunder
from making certain distributions or payments of capital or income to their members. As a result, the
amounts that the Issuers expect to receive from other members of our corporate group may not be
forthcoming or sufficient to enable the Issuers to service their obligations on the Notes.

The Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. The Parent Guarantor
is a holding company with no assets or sources of income of its own and thus is dependent on dividends
and other distributions from its subsidiaries. The Subsidiary Guarantors are either intermediate holding
companies or operating subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees across multiple jurisdictions may prove_**
**_difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuers, one of which is incorporated under the laws of Ireland and the
other of which is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (United States), and will be
guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor, which is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Most of the
Subsidiary Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of a number of different jurisdictions
outside the United States. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be
initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and
costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of
your rights. Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and
administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively
enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuers’ and the
Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other
and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and
other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The
application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the
Guarantees in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Subsidiary Guarantors are organized limit the
ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a sister company. See ‘‘—Corporate benefit, capital
maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined in the
Description of the Notes) may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the
Notes and the Security Interests.’’

**_An active trading market may not develop for the Notes._**

The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no existing market. Although application will
be made for listing particulars to be approved by Euronext Dublin and for the Notes to be admitted to the
Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market, we cannot assure
you that the Notes will become or will remain listed. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market
that may develop for the Notes, the ability of holders of the Notes to sell them or the price at which the
holders of the Notes may be able to sell them. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the
number of holders of the Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other
factors, including general economic conditions and our own financial condition, performance and

16


-----

prospects, as well as recommendations by securities analysts. Historically, the market for non-investment
grade debt, such as the Notes, has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial price volatility.
There can be no assurances that if a market for the Notes were to develop, such a market would not be
subject to similar disruptions. We have been informed by the Initial Purchaser that it intends to make a
market for the Notes after the offering is completed. However, the Initial Purchaser is not obligated to do
so and may cease their market-making activity at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making
activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and
regulations. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or, if
one does develop, that it will be maintained.

**_The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer._**

The Notes have not been and, will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state
securities laws. You may not offer the Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or
a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. We have not undertaken to register the
Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the future. Furthermore, we have not registered the
Notes under any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of
the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See ‘‘Notice
to Investors.’’

**_Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders
of Notes. DTC, or its nominee, will be the registered holder of the Regulation S Global Notes and the
Rule 144A Global Notes (as such terms are defined in ‘‘Book-entry; Delivery and Form’’). After payment
to DTC’s custodian, as the case may be, we, the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of
book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of
DTC and if you are not a participant in DTC, on the procedures of the participant through which you own
your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the Indenture. See ‘‘Book-entry;
Delivery and Form.’’

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have
received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or, if applicable, a participant. There can be no assurance
that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any
request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive
registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will
be restricted to acting through DTC. We, the Trustee, and the Principal Paying Agent cannot assure you
that the procedures to be implemented through DTC will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of
rights under the Notes. See ‘‘Book-entry; Delivery and Form.’’

**_You may be unable to serve process on us or our directors and officers in the United States and enforce U.S._**
**_judgments based on the Notes._**

Ardagh Packaging Finance, the co-issuer of the Notes, is incorporated under the laws of Ireland and
the Parent Guarantor of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Most of the Subsidiary
Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of a number of different jurisdictions outside the

17


-----

United States. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and such
Guarantors live outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Ardagh Packaging Finance and
the Guarantors (other than the Subsidiary Guarantors in Delaware (United States)), and substantially all
of the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, it
may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons in the United States or to enforce judgments
obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the
United States.

In addition, local counsel have informed us that it is questionable whether a foreign court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. See
‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.’’

**_Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests may_**
**_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and the Security Interests._**

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Subsidiary Guarantors are organized limit the
ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a related company or grant security on account of a
related company’s debts. These limitations arise under various provisions or principles of corporate law
which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among others, the risks associated with a
guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and
economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective, as well as thin
capitalization, unfair consideration, financial assistance, corporate purpose or similar law affecting the
rights of creditors generally, and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations were not observed, the
Guarantees and the grant of Security Interests by these Subsidiary Guarantors could be subject to legal
challenge. In some jurisdictions, the Guarantees will contain language limiting the amount of debt
guaranteed or secured so that applicable local law restrictions will not be violated. Certain of the Security
Documents will contain similar limitations. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a
Subsidiary Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions or seek to enforce a Security Interest in Collateral
granted by a Subsidiary Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions, your claims are likely to be limited. In
some cases, where the amount that can be guaranteed or secured is limited by reference to the net assets
and legal capital of the Subsidiary Guarantor or by reference to the outstanding debt owed by the relevant
Subsidiary Guarantor to the Issuers under intercompany loans that amount might have reached zero or
close to zero at the time of any insolvency or enforcement. Furthermore, although we believe that the
Guarantees by these Subsidiary Guarantors and the Security Interests granted by these Subsidiary
Guarantors will be validly given in accordance with local law restrictions, there can be no assurance that a
third-party creditor would not challenge these Guarantees and the Security Interests and prevail in court.

The Indenture will provide that except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee or the
Security Agent, as applicable, will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes, the
Guarantees and the Security Interests. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture restrict
the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take other legal actions against the
Subsidiary Guarantors and by accepting any Note you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions.
As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse under the
Guarantees and the Security Interests in the event of a default by the Issuers or a Subsidiary Guarantor.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, holders of indebtedness of,
and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are
entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made
available for distribution to any Guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholders.

18


-----

Accordingly, in the event that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or
otherwise reorganizes:

   - the creditors of the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed
against such subsidiary’s assets; and

   - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any
Guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such
subsidiary.

As of December 31, 2019, on a historical basis, Ardagh’s non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries would
have had $14 million of debt outstanding and $111 million of trade payables and deferred taxes, all of
which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely_**
**_affect their validity and enforceability._**

Our obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. Most of the Subsidiary
Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of a number of different jurisdictions outside the
United States.

Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees, limitations on the
enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the
Guarantee against a Guarantor. The court or an insolvency administrator may also in certain
circumstances avoid the Guarantee where the company is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The
following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes
generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent
transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Guarantees and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent
transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain
findings, to:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee;

   - direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security to the
relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and

   - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee is found to be a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any
amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will
be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the
Guarantors will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would
apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. Also, there is a possibility that the
Guarantees may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

19


-----

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued, the relevant Guarantor:

  - issued such Guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future
creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its
insolvency;

  - issued such Guarantee in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such
Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor; or

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee
on the basis that the Guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s
benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of
the Guarantee or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about
to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required
payments as and when they would become due.

   - Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in
different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee if:

   - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

  - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; and/or

   - the present salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts
and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the offering of the Notes,
there can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date the Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a
court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued,
that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

**_We do not present separate financial statements for each Subsidiary Guarantor._**

We have not presented in this Offering Memorandum separate financial statements for each
Subsidiary Guarantor, and we are not required to do so in the future under the Indenture.

**_The current shareholders of ARD Holdings can exert considerable control over the Ardagh Group._**

The interests of some controlling shareholders may not be entirely consistent with our interests or
those of other shareholders or holders of the Notes. It is possible that the controlling shareholders may
take actions in relation to our business that are not entirely in our best interests or the best interests of the
other shareholders of ARD Holdings, our parent company, or holders of the Notes. Paul Coulson is
Chairman of the Board of Directors of ARD Holdings. As of the date hereof, a company which is owned
by Paul Coulson owns approximately 25% of the issued share capital of ARD Holdings. Through its
non-controlling interest in the Yeoman group of companies, this company has an interest in a further
approximate 34% of the issued share capital of ARD Holdings.

Paul Coulson, Brendan Dowling, Gerald Moloney and Herman Troskie also serve as directors in the
Yeoman group of companies. As a result of their ownership and positions, Yeoman and Messrs. Coulson,
Dowling, Moloney and Troskie are each able to significantly influence, through Yeoman, all matters
requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate

20


-----

transactions. See Item 6 ‘‘Directors, Senior Management and Employees’’ and Item 7 ‘‘Major Shareholders
and Related Party Transactions’’ (each incorporated by reference herein) in the Form 20-F.

In addition, as a result of the issuance by ARD Finance of the Toggle Notes and the interest service
obligations thereof, we may pay more dividends to our shareholders (including ARD Finance) than we
might otherwise have paid if the Toggle Notes had not been issued. Such dividend payments would reduce
the amount of cash available to the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Notes and the Collateral securing the Notes may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Notes and the Guarantees are secured by first priority security interests on the Collateral as
described in this Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures on a first priority basis our and our
subsidiaries’ obligations under the Existing Secured Notes and certain hedging obligations.

The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture.
Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or a
reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes. For example, under certain circumstances, we will be able
to sell or otherwise dispose of real estate assets that are part of the Collateral without securing the Notes
with assets acquired with the proceeds from such sales or dispositions. In addition, when we entered into
the ABL Facility in December 2017, some or all of the receivables, which previously formed part of the
Collateral, were released from the liens securing the Existing Secured Notes and no longer form part of the
Collateral. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—ABL Credit Facility.’’

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend
upon many factors including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the
condition of the economies in which our operations are located, the availability of buyers and other factors.
The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets.
Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. The
Collateral is located in a number of countries, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the
Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured debt
or third parties enjoy liens (including statutory liens), whether or not permitted by the Indenture, such
holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral securing the Notes and
the Guarantees which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy the obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The Security Interests over the Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to_**
**_the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

In Germany, the Netherlands and Poland, the security over the Collateral that constitutes, or will
constitute, security for the obligations of the Issuers under the Notes and the Indenture is not granted
directly to the noteholders but only in favor of the Security Agent, as beneficiary of parallel debt
obligations (‘‘Parallel Debt’’). This Parallel Debt was created to satisfy a requirement under the respective
laws of Germany, the Netherlands and Poland that the Security Agent, as grantee of certain types of
collateral, be a creditor of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and
payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuers under the Indenture and the Notes (the
‘‘Principal Obligations’’). Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent has, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against
the Issuers for the full principal amount of the Notes. The holders of the Notes are not entitled to enforce
such security except through the Security Agent. Holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. The Parallel Debt obligations referred to above
are contained in the Indenture, which is governed by New York law. There is no assurance that such a

structure will be effective before French, German, Polish or Dutch courts as there is no judicial or other
guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be
restricted.

The Security Documents submitted to Italian law provide that the rights with respect to the Collateral
must be exercised by the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes. Under Italian law, a security
interest created pursuant to a pledge may not be validly enforceable for the benefit of the beneficiaries
who are not a party to the relevant pledge agreement creating the security interest. Therefore, holders of
the Notes will not have any security interest in respect of the pledge of our Italian subsidiaries and must
rely on the waterfall in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_You will not have a security interest in any of the Collateral on the Issue Date and you will not have the benefit of the_**
**_guarantees from any of the Subsidiary Guarantors on the Issue Date._**

You will not have a security interest in any of the Collateral in place on the Issue Date and the
Guarantees, other than the Parent Guarantee by the Parent Guarantor, will also not be in effect until
90 days, or upon delivery of an officer’s certificate to the Trustee stating that in the good faith
determination of the Issuers the outbreak of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread has made it
impracticable to incur and perfect such security interests, 120 days, following the Issue Date with respect to
the Subsidiary Guarantees by the Subsidiary Guarantors that at that time guarantee the Existing Notes.
Until such time as the Collateral is in place, the Issuers’ obligations to pay interest on the Notes will be
unsecured obligations during this period and will rank behind their secured obligations to the extent such
amount is insufficient to pay the interest on the Notes.

Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the delivery of Collateral may negatively
impact the value of the Collateral. To the extent a lien in certain Collateral is perfected following the Issue
Date, it might be avoidable in bankruptcy or create new hardening periods. See ‘‘—The granting of the
Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods for such
Security Interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions.’’

**_Under local law, claims of the holders of Notes may not have a first priority ranking pari passu with the Existing_**
**_Secured Notes and we are relying on the Intercreditor Agreement to achieve a first priority lien in the Collateral._**

Under local law, the liens securing the Notes may be subject to legal doctrines that effectively rank
them behind the liens in favor of earlier incurred obligations, including the liens in favor of the Existing
Secured Notes. Therefore, in each case, the first priority status of the Notes depends on the enforceability
of the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, if the Intercreditor Agreement is found to be invalid or
unenforceable for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to give effect to it, the Notes may rank behind
any other outstanding secured indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
Agreement.’’

**_The granting of the Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods for_**
**_such Security Interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of new Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create
hardening periods for such Security Interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for
these new Security Interests will run as from the moment each new Security Interest has been granted,
perfected or recreated. At each time, if the Security Interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be
enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be
declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce such Security Interest.

Existing Secured Notes and certain hedging obligations. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides
for the subordination, in right of payment and enforcement, of all intercompany debt to all of the
aforementioned senior debt and to the Existing Senior Notes and the Notes offered hereby and the
respective guarantees thereof. With respect to the ranking of the guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides that the senior guarantees by the guarantors of the Existing Secured Notes will rank _pari passu_
with each other and each guarantor’s obligations under other senior debt and certain hedging obligations
and will rank senior to each Subsidiary Guarantor’s senior subordinated guarantees of the Existing Senior
Notes and the Notes offered hereby. However, any claim by the holders of the Existing Secured Notes,
hedging counterparties, the holders of the Existing Senior Notes and the holders of the Notes offered
hereby have in respect of the Guarantee from Heye International GmbH will be subordinated to any claim
UniCredit Bank AG has under the UniCredit Working Capital and Performance Guarantee Credit Lines.

**ABL Credit Facility**

**_Overview_**

On December 7, 2017, Ardagh Group S.A. and certain of its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Borrowers’’) entered
into a $700 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ‘‘ABL Facility’’) provided by a
syndicate of financial institutions (collectively, the ‘‘ABL Lenders,’’) with Citibank, N.A. (or an affiliate
thereof) as administrative agent for the purpose of, among other things, refinancing in full certain existing
working capital facilities and financing ongoing working capital, to pay fees and expenses in connection
with the foregoing and general corporate purposes of the Borrowers and their affiliates. Under the ABL
Facility, the Borrowers may request to increase the commitments thereunder by up to $400 million subject
to certain conditions. The ABL Facility is guaranteed by Ardagh Group S.A. and the Borrowers, other than
Ardagh Treasury Limited. The ABL Facility is secured by inventory and accounts receivable and related
assets of the Borrowers. The collateral securing the ABL Facility also secures liabilities under bank
products (including credit card transactions and cash management services) owing to the ABL Lenders or
their affiliates.

**_Final Maturity and Amortization_**

The ABL Facility matures on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of the closing and (ii) at any time,
the date that is 91 calendar days prior to the earliest scheduled maturity date under any of the
Ardagh S.A.’s existing public indentures or documents in respect of indebtedness of Ardagh Group S.A.
and the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the ABL Facility) with an aggregate outstanding principal
amount (including undrawn commitments in respect thereof) in excess of $200 million, in each case in
effect at such time, unless the indebtedness under such indentures or such other documents has been
repaid in full or refinanced to have a scheduled maturity date that is at least 91 calendar days after the date
in clause (i) above subject to certain exceptions set forth in the ABL Facility.

30


-----

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

Interest on borrowings will be based upon an annual rate equal to (A) in the case of the base rate
loans, a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% and (B) in the case of EURIBOR loans,
LIBOR loans and overnight eurocurrency rate loans, the adjusted LIBOR rate for such currency plus a
margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00%, in each case of clauses (A) and (B) above with such margin
depending on the average historical global borrowing availability for the quarter ending immediately prior
to such Adjustment Date. The fees applicable to the ABL Facility include an administrative agency fee,
collateral monitoring fee, unused commitment fee and letter of credit fees.

**_Borrowings_**

Borrowings under the ABL Facility are made available by way of U.S. dollar, Pound Sterling and Euro
loans, letters of credit and swingline loans. A portion of the ABL Facility is available for issuing letters of
credit and for making swingline loans, respectively, by the ABL Lenders. The borrowings under the ABL
Facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty. The ABL Facility contains customary mandatory
prepayment requirements if the outstanding amounts thereunder exceed the availability.

Borrowings by each Borrower are limited by the borrowing base applicable to such Borrower as set
forth in the ABL Facility. The ‘‘Borrowing Base’’ of each Borrower is the sum of (a) in the case of
Borrowers which grant a security interest over accounts receivable, 85% of the book value of such
Borrower’s eligible accounts receivable, plus (b) in the case of Borrowers which grant a security interest
over inventory, the lesser of (i) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of such Borrower’s eligible
inventory and (ii) 75% of the cost of such Borrower’s eligible inventory, minus (c) in all cases, customary
applicable reserves. The ABL Facility includes a mechanism by which portions of certain borrowing bases
may be allocated to other borrowing bases.

**_Covenants_**

Under the ABL Facility, if, and only if, global borrowing availability is less than 10% of the lesser of
(i) the commitments as of such date and (ii) the global borrowing base as of such date (subject to
customary equity cure and suspension provisions) a springing financial covenant comes into effect which
would require Ardagh Group S.A. to maintain a 1.0 to 1.0 fixed charge coverage ratio.

The ABL Facility includes cash dominion provisions providing that if either (i) a specified event of
default is continuing or (ii) availability under the commitments is less than a percentage of the
commitments ranging from 12.5% to 17.5%, depending on the Borrower, for three consecutive business
days, and continuing until the calendar day on which (A) no specified event of default is continuing and
(B) availability is greater than a percentage of the commitments ranging from 12.5% to 17.5%, depending
on the Borrower, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) above, for 30 consecutive calendar days, then amounts
in the collateral deposit accounts of the Borrowers will be transferred daily into a blocked account held by
the administrative agent and applied to reduce outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility.

The ABL Facility also includes representations, warranties and covenants that are generally of a
nature customary for such facility offered to similar borrowers, except that many of the covenants are
substantially similar to the covenants in Ardagh Group S.A.’s existing indentures. These include covenants
which limit or restrict the ability of Ardagh Group S.A. and its Restricted Subsidiaries to (i) make
restricted payments such as dividends and investments, in each case unless certain payment conditions are
met and (ii) to dispose of all or substantially all of their assets unless certain specified conditions are met,
and which limit the ability of the Ardagh Group to reorganize or dispose of all of its assets unless certain
specified conditions are met.

31


-----

**_Events of Default_**

The ABL Facility contains provisions governing certain events of default, including failure to make
payment of the amounts due (with a five-business day grace period in the case of amounts other than
principal), defaults under other agreements evidencing indebtedness over a certain threshold, failure to
comply with covenants or other obligations (after a grace period of six business days or thirty days for
certain affirmative covenants), material misrepresentations, certain ERISA events subject to a material
adverse effect qualification, change of control, certain bankruptcy events and actual or asserted invalidity
of the security interests created under any security documents under the ABL Facility. The occurrence of
an event of default could result in the acceleration of payment obligations under the ABL Facility.

**UniCredit Working Capital and Performance Guarantee Credit Lines**

Heye International GmbH supports its business activities with two open lines of credit from UniCredit
Bank AG. Heye International GmbH is entitled to draw up to A1.0 million on one of the lines of credit for
the purposes of financing its short-term working capital requirements. The second credit line is available
for up to A15.0 million of guarantee payments relating to Heye International GmbH’s project business.

These facilities are secured by a pledge of all Heye International GmbH’s present and future property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets, an assignment over all present and future claims resulting from
delivery of goods and services to domestic and foreign customers and an assignment over all existing and
future trade receivables.

**_BNP Facility_**

Ardagh Packaging Holdings Limited and certain of its subsidiaries (the ‘‘BNP Facility Companies’’)
have entered into an uncommitted receivables purchase agreement with BNP Paribas Dublin Branch
(‘‘BNP’’). Under the BNP Facility, the BNP Facility Companies may, from time to time, request that BNP
purchase certain receivables satisfactory to BNP. BNP may, at its absolute discretion, agree to purchase any
such receivables for a purchase price, subject to an overall facility limit of A100,000,000. BNP has no
recourse to the BNP Facility Companies in relation to any purchased receivables save where non-payment
results from a Recourse Event (as defined in the BNP Facility). The BNP Facility includes customary
representations and warranties, covenants and events of default for financing arrangements of this type.

**_Rabobank Facility_**

Ardagh Group S.A. and certain of its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Rabobank Facility Companies’’) have entered
into a receivables purchase agreement with Co¨operatieve Rabobank U.A., as facility agent, and Nieuw
Amsterdam Receivables Corporation B.V., as purchaser (the ‘‘Purchaser’’). Under the Rabobank Facility,
the Rabobank Facility Companies sell certain receivables to the Purchaser up to a facility limit of
A50,000,000. The Rabobank Facility is secured on the receivables collection accounts of the Rabobank
Facility Companies. Rabobank has no recourse to the Rabobank Facility Companies in relation to any
purchase receivables other than in respect of liabilities of the relevant Rabobank Facility Company in
respect of its obligations pursuant to or under any Relevant Receivable, Contract or Related Rights (each
as defined in the Rabobank Facility). The Rabobank Facility includes customary representations and
warranties, covenants and events of default for financing arrangements of this type.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The definitions of certain terms used in this description are set forth under the subheading ‘‘—Certain
Definitions.’’ In this ‘‘Description of the Notes,’’ the term ‘‘Ardagh Holdings USA’’ refers only to Ardagh
Holdings USA Inc., a Delaware corporation, the term ‘‘Ardagh Packaging Finance’’ refers only to Ardagh
Packaging Finance plc, the term ‘‘Issuers’’ refers only to Ardagh Holdings USA and Ardagh Packaging
Finance collectively, and the term ‘‘Parent Guarantor’’ refers only to Ardagh Group S.A. and not to any of
its Subsidiaries, except for the purpose of financial data determined on a consolidated or combined basis,
as the case may be. In addition, the term ‘‘Subsidiary Guarantors’’ refers only to any Restricted Subsidiary
that incurs a Guarantee and the term ‘‘Guarantors’’ refers to the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary
Guarantors collectively. Each of the Issuers and each Subsidiary Guarantor will be a direct or indirect
Restricted Subsidiary. In this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ the term ‘‘Notes’’ refers also to ‘‘book-entry
interests’’ in the Notes, as defined herein.

The Issuers will issue and the Guarantors will guarantee $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
senior secured notes due 2025 denominated in U.S. dollars (the ‘‘Notes’’) under an indenture (the
‘‘Indenture’’) among, inter alios, the Issuers, the Guarantors, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee (in
such capacity, the ‘‘Trustee’’), and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as security agent (in such capacity, the
‘‘Security Agent’’), and certain other agents thereto. Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Notes
include those set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture is not required to be nor will it be qualified under,
or be subject to, the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) of such Act.

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) entered into in the future. The terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding
the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees. Please see the
section entitled ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a summary of the
material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Indenture. It does not, however,
restate the Indenture in its entirety, and where reference is made to particular provisions of the Indenture,
such provisions, including the definitions of certain terms, are qualified in their entirety by reference to all
of the provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. You should read the Indenture because it contains
additional information and because it and not this description defines your rights as a holder of the Notes.
A copy of the form of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement may be obtained by requesting it
from the Issuers at the address indicated under ‘‘Listing and General Information.’’

The Issuers will make an application for the Notes to be listed on the Global Exchange Market of
Euronext Dublin. The Issuers can provide no assurance that this application will be accepted.

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The Notes:

(a) will be each Issuer’s general obligations;

(b) mature on April 30, 2025;

(c) will initially be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Parent Guarantor;

(d) subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Subsidiaries
of the Parent Guarantor (other than the Issuers) that guarantee the Existing Ardagh Bonds
within the periods and to the extent required by ‘‘—Security—Post-Closing Matters’’ below; and

33


-----

(e) subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be secured on a first priority basis by the Collateral
currently securing the Existing Secured Notes within the periods and to the extent required by
‘‘—Security—Post-Closing Matters’’ below.

**Security**

On or prior to the dates specified in the Indenture and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
obligations of the Issuers under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under their respective
Guarantees will be secured by Liens on all of the assets that secure the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’
obligations under the Existing Secured Notes. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent
Guarantor shall be required to ensure that Security Interests for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders
in any assets that secure the Existing Secured Notes are in place and perfected no later than 90 days
following the Issue Date, or, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that in the good
faith determination of the Issuers the outbreak of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread has made
it impracticable to incur and perfect such security interests, 120 days following the Issue Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the replacement and/or refinancing of the Existing Secured
Notes other than the August 2019 Secured Notes, all mortgages or similar Security Interests in real
property in any jurisdiction other than the England and Wales or any state of the United States shall be
released, and such real property shall no longer comprise Collateral.

We expect the Collateral to consist of, _inter alia, (i) pledges of the Parent Guarantor’s and the_
Restricted Subsidiaries’ shares in the share capital or other similar equity interests of all of our Subsidiary
Guarantors that are currently part of Ardagh in Denmark, England, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Sweden,
the United States and The Netherlands and Norway, (ii) floating charges over substantially all of our
assets, including receivables and inventory in England, Ireland and the United States (with the exclusion of
inventory and receivables) and (iii) fixed land charges over certain of our real estate assets and interests in
land in England and Wales and mortgages over certain of our real estate assets in the United States. The
assets and property of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries that are from time to time subject to, or
required to be subject to, a Lien pursuant to the Security Documents are referred to as the ‘‘Collateral.’’
The security and other agreements, including amendments, supplements and waivers thereto, in respect of
the Collateral are referred to as the ‘‘Security Documents.’’

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the Parent Guarantor is permitted to pledge or cause its Subsidiaries to
pledge the Collateral in connection with future incurrence of Debt, including issuances of Additional
Notes (as defined below), permitted under the Indenture on a pari passu basis with the then outstanding
Notes. The Collateral can also be released from the Liens of the Security Documents under certain
circumstances. See ‘‘—Release of the Security’’ below.

Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged by the Parent Guarantor and certain of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to secure the payment when due of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’, as
applicable, payment obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security
Documents will be entered into by, inter alios, the Security Agent, who acts as security agent for the Trustee
and the holders of Notes.

Each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements as described under ‘‘—Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’ below, in each
case in compliance with the Indenture and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of Notes, by accepting a
Note, appoints the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its agent under the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and authorizes it to
act as such.

34


-----

The Security Documents will provide that the rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the
Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent. Since the holders of the Notes are not a party to the
Security Documents, holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any
rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders may only act through the Trustee or the
Security Agent, as applicable. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created
by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture without requiring any consent of the
holders. The Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action
under the Security Documents. For additional information concerning enforcement of Liens relating to
Collateral, see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuers and the Guarantors, as the case may be,
will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends,
stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or
reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing) in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral.

The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy the
Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees, and the Collateral securing
the Notes may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional
Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. Please
see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees.’’

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuers or the Guarantors in
connection with this offering of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the
Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the Indenture and the Security Documents following an Event
of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the Notes or the Guarantees. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all.

The Security Documents, respectively, will be governed by applicable local laws and provide that the
rights with respect to the Notes and the Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent and in respect
of the entire outstanding amount of the Notes. The term ‘‘Security Interests’’ refers to the Liens in the
Collateral.

**_Post-Closing Matters_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent Guarantor shall be required to ensure that
within 90 days following the Issue Date, each of the subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (other than the
Issuers) that guarantees the Existing Ardagh Bonds becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor; provided that upon
delivery of an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that in the good faith determination of the Issuers
the outbreak of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread has made it impracticable to provide such
guarantees within 90 days following the Issue Date, such guarantees may be provided within 120 days
following the Issue Date.

**_Release of the Security_**

All of the Liens granted under the Security Documents will be automatically and unconditionally
released upon Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as described under ‘‘—Legal Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance’’ or if all obligations under the Indenture are discharged in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions in the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

35


-----

In addition, the Liens granted by a Subsidiary Guarantor (and the Liens, if any, over the Capital Stock
of such Subsidiary Guarantor) will be automatically and unconditionally released:

(a) upon any sale or disposition of (i) Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor following which such
Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after
giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary that does not
violate the covenant described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets’’;

(b) in the event that all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor is sold or otherwise
disposed of pursuant to an enforcement of the security over the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary
Guarantor under the applicable Security Document(s) in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) upon the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(d) in the circumstances set forth in the third paragraph of ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Consolidation,
Merger and Sale of Assets’’;

(e) as described under the caption ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’; and

(f) with respect to mortgages or similar security interests in real property (other than in England and
Wales or in any state of the United States) as described above under ‘‘—Security.’’

In addition, Liens on property or assets constituting Collateral may also be released to the extent
necessary or advisable to enable the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary to consummate the sale,
transfer or other disposition of such property or assets provided that such sale, transfer or other disposition
does not violate the covenant described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets.’’

In addition, the Liens granted by the Parent Guarantor and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under
the Security Documents in respect of assets constituting inventories and accounts receivable (and other
assets customarily relating to inventories and accounts receivable such as insurance proceeds, books and
records and other assets) may be released, without the consent of the Trustee, the holders of the Notes or
the Security Agent, to secure Debt to be incurred under clause (b) of paragraph (2) of ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Debt’’; _provided that if the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted_
Subsidiaries owning such assets grants a Silent Second Lien over such assets in favor of any other Debt,
they shall also grant a Silent Second Lien in favor of the Security Agent (on its own behalf and on behalf of
the Trustee for the holders of the Notes; _provided,_ _further, that upon the release of such Silent Second_
Liens securing such other Debt, the Liens in favor of the Security Agent (on its own behalf and on behalf
of the Trustee for the holders of the Notes) shall be automatically released.

**The Guarantees**

The Guarantors will jointly and severally guarantee the due and punctual payment of all amounts
payable under the Notes, including principal, premium, if any, and interest payable under the Notes.

The obligations of a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor to issue a Guarantee of the Notes, if required
by the Indenture, will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The obligations of each Subsidiary
Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can
be guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor without resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee being
voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent transfer, or under similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally or the maximum amount otherwise permitted by law. In
particular, each Guarantee will be limited as required to comply with corporate benefit, maintenance of
capital and other laws applicable in the jurisdiction of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor. By virtue of these
limitations, a Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee could be significantly less than
amounts payable in respect of the Notes, or a Subsidiary Guarantor may have effectively no obligations

36


-----

under its Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees—
Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security
Interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and the
Security Interests.’’

Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee will be entitled to
contribution from any other Guarantor.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

All of the Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon shall
terminate and be discharged and be of no further force and effect) upon Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance as described under ‘‘—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’ or if all obligations under
the Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, in each case in accordance
with the terms and conditions in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, a Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee (and the Guarantee, if any, of any Subsidiary of such
Subsidiary Guarantor) will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon shall terminate
and be discharged and be of no further force and effect):

(a) upon any sale or disposition of (i) Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor following which such
Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after
giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary that does not
violate the covenant described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets’’;

(b) in the event that all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor is sold or otherwise
disposed of pursuant to an enforcement of the security over the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary
Guarantor under the applicable Security Document(s) in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) upon the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(d) in the circumstances set forth in the third paragraph of ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Consolidation,
Merger and Sale of Assets’’; and

(e) as described under the caption ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers.’’

**Release of Ardagh Holdings USA’s Obligations**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, upon the sale or disposition directly or
indirectly of the Capital Stock of Ardagh Holdings USA pursuant to an enforcement by the Security Agent
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the
Indenture (a ‘‘Holdings USA Disposition’’), the obligations of Ardagh Holdings USA under the Notes and
the Indenture will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon shall terminate and be
discharged and be of no further effect); provided that each other guarantee by Ardagh Holdings USA in
respect of any Credit Facility and any other capital markets debt of the Parent Guarantor or any of its
subsidiaries has been released (or is released simultaneously upon such Holdings USA Disposition). Upon
a Holdings USA Disposition, Ardagh Packaging Finance shall be the sole Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture, and the Notes and the Indenture will remain in full force and effect and any reference in the
Indenture, the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement (and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to
the ‘‘Issuers’’ or Ardagh Holdings USA shall be deemed to be references only to the ‘‘Issuer’’ or Ardagh
Packaging Finance, mutatis mutandis.

37


-----

The Parent Guarantor will publish a notice of a Holdings USA Disposition described in the
immediately preceding paragraph in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under
‘‘—Notices’’ and, so long as the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, notify such exchange of a Holdings
USA Disposition.

**Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

(a) will be each of the Issuer’s general obligations;

(b) will rank senior in right of payment to any and all of each Issuer’s existing and future
indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

(c) will rank equally in right of payment with all of each of the Issuer’s existing and future
indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

(d) will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor’s
subsidiaries that do not provide Guarantees; and

(e) will be effectively subordinated to all of each of the Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness
under the ABL Facility to the extent of the value of receivables and inventory securing such
indebtedness.

**_The Parent Guarantor’s Guarantee_**

The Parent Guarantor’s Guarantee:

(a) will be the Parent Guarantor’s general obligation;

(b) will rank senior in right of payment to any and all of the Parent Guarantor’s existing and future
indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee;

(c) will rank effectively equally with all of the Parent Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness
that is secured by a first priority Lien on the Collateral, including its obligations under the
Existing Secured Notes;

(d) will rank equally in right of payment with any and all of the Parent Guarantor’s existing and
future indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee;

(e) will be effectively subordinated to the Parent Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness under
the ABL Facility to the extent of the value of receivables and inventory securing such
indebtedness; and

(f) will be effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the Parent
Guarantor to the extent of the assets securing the Guarantee by the Parent Guarantor.

**_The Subsidiary Guarantors’ Guarantees_**

Each Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee:

(a) will be such Guarantor’s general obligation;

(b) will rank senior in right of payment to any and all of such Subsidiary Guarantor’s existing and
future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee;

38


-----

(c) will rank effectively equally with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is
secured by a first priority Lien on the Collateral, including its obligations under the Existing
Secured Notes;

(d) will rank equally in right of payment to any and all of such Subsidiary Guarantor’s existing and
future indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee; and

(e) will be effectively senior to any and all of such Subsidiary Guarantor’s existing and future
unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such Subsidiary Guarantor’s
Guarantee.

As a result of the foregoing, it is expected that the Notes will rank equally in right of payment and will
be effectively secured on a pari passu basis with the Existing Secured Notes.

At December 31, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes and the
use of proceeds therefrom on a consolidated basis, the Parent Guarantor would have had total debt
(before deducting deferred financing costs) secured by the Collateral, including the Notes, of $6,442
million.

In addition, on a historical basis, at December 31, 2019, Ardagh’s non-guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries had (i) $14 million of debt outstanding and (ii) aggregated trade payables and deferred taxes
of $111 million.

Not all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries
will likely be required to repay financial and trade creditors before distributing any assets to the Issuers or
a Guarantor.

Ardagh Packaging Finance is a finance subsidiary without operations and Ardagh Holdings USA is a
holding company with no independent operations. Therefore, each Issuer depends on the cash flow of the
Parent Guarantor’s operating Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the
Notes. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries’’ other
than Enville Limited, Ardagh Containers Holdings Limited, UniMould S.A., Ardagh Packaging Finance
UK Limited, Recan GmbH and Recan UK Limited. However, under the circumstances described below
under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ the
Parent Guarantor will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in
the Indenture.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Debt that the Issuers, the
Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, the amount of such additional Debt could be
substantial.

**Limitations Under Guarantees and Security Interests**

The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Security Interests it has
granted to secure the Notes, if any, will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that
can be guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor without resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee
and its Security Interests, if any, being voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws relating to
fraudulent transfer or under similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or the maximum
amount otherwise permitted by law. In particular, each Guarantee and each Security Interest will be
limited as required to comply with corporate benefit, maintenance of capital and other laws applicable in

39


-----

the jurisdiction of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor. By virtue of these limitations, a Subsidiary
Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee and its Security Interests, if any, could be significantly less
than amounts payable in respect of the Notes, or a Subsidiary Guarantor may have effectively no
obligations under its Guarantee or its Security Interests. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt,
the Notes and the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the
Guarantees and the Security Interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees of the Notes and the Security Interests.’’

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will mature on April 30, 2025, and 100% of the principal amount thereof shall be payable
on the maturity date thereof, unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. Subject to the covenant
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Liens,’’ the Issuers are permitted to issue additional Notes as part of a further issue under the Indenture
(the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) from time to time; _provided that, if any Additional Notes are not fungible with_
any series of original Notes, for U.S. income tax purposes such Additional Notes will have a separate
CUSIP number and ISIN. The Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture
will be treated as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture, including waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase, except for certain waivers and amendments. Unless the context
otherwise requires, references to the ‘‘Notes’’ for all purposes of the Indenture and in this ‘‘Description of
the Notes’’ include references to any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be
payable semi-annually in arrears from the Issue Date. Interest will be payable on each Note on April 30
and October 30 of each year, commencing on October 30, 2020. Interest on the Notes will be payable to
the holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest
payment date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months
and will be paid on overdue principal and other overdue amounts at the same rate.

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be issued on the Issue Date only in fully registered form without coupons and only in
minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Notes will be initially in the form of one or more global notes (the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The Global
Notes will be deposited with a custodian for DTC. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes, referred to
as ‘‘book-entry interests,’’ will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC or its participants.
Book-entry interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by DTC and its participants. The terms of the Indenture will provide for
the issuance of definitive registered Notes in certain circumstances. See ‘‘Book-entry; Delivery and Form.’’

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Global Notes may be transferred in accordance with the Indenture. All transfers of book-entry
interests between participants in DTC will be effected by DTC pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to applicable rules and procedures established by DTC and its participants. See ‘‘Book-entry;
Delivery and Form.’’

The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as
described under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent**

The Issuers will make all payments, including principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes,
through an agent in London that it will maintain for these purposes. Initially that agent will be
Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The Issuers may change the paying agent without prior notice to the
holders of the Notes. In addition, the Issuers or any of their Subsidiaries may act as paying agent in
connection with the Notes other than for the purposes of effecting a redemption described under
‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ or an offer to purchase the Notes described under ‘‘—Purchase of Notes upon
a Change of Control’’ or ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets.’’ The Issuers will
make all payments in same-day funds.

No service charge will be made for any registration of a transfer, exchange or redemption of the
Notes, but the Issuers may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar
governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange (but not for
a redemption).

**Additional Amounts**

All payments that the Issuers make under or with respect to the Notes or that the Guarantors make
under or with respect to the Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other
governmental charge (including, without limitation, penalties, interest and other similar liabilities related
thereto) of whatever nature (collectively, ‘‘Taxes’’) imposed or levied on such payments by or on behalf of
any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia) in which any
Issuer or Guarantor is organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes or from or through which any
of the foregoing (or its agents, including the Paying Agent) makes any payment on the Notes or by or
within any department, political subdivision or governmental authority of or in any of the foregoing having
power to tax (each, a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’), unless such Issuer or Guarantor or other applicable
withholding agent, as the case may be, is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law or by the
interpretation or administration of law. If either Issuer, a Guarantor or other applicable withholding agent
is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes imposed or levied on behalf of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee,
such Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay additional amounts (‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may
be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each beneficial owner of the Notes after such
withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction in respect of any Additional Amounts)
will not be less than the amount the beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been
withheld or deducted.

None of the Issuers or Guarantors will, however, pay Additional Amounts in respect or on account of:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by
reason of the holder’s or beneficial owner’s present or former connection with such Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership, holding or disposition of Notes, or by
reason of the receipt of any payments in respect of any Notes or any Guarantee, or the exercise
or enforcement of rights under any Notes or any Guarantee);

(b) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder
or beneficial owner of Notes, following the Issuers’ written request addressed to the holder or
beneficial owner, to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements (to the extent such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so), whether
required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction,
as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of,
such Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a

41


-----

certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax which is payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payments made under
or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(e) any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment by any of the Issuers or Guarantors to the
holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner
of such payment to the extent that such Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had
such beneficial owner been the holder of such Note;

(f) any Tax that is imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner who
would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Notes to
another paying agent in a member state of the European Union or the United Kingdom;

(g) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first
made available to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(h) any U.S. federal withholding Taxes or equivalent thereof imposed pursuant to Sections 1471
through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as of the Issue Date (or any amended or
successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply
with), any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or other official administrative
interpretations thereof and any agreements entered into pursuant to current Section 1471(b)(1)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version
described above), and including (for the avoidance of doubt) any intergovernmental agreements
(and any law, regulation, rule or practice implementing any such intergovernmental agreement)
in respect of the foregoing; or

(i) any combination of the foregoing.

The Issuers and the Guarantors, if the applicable withholding agents, will (i) make such withholding
or deduction as is required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the
relevant authority in accordance with applicable law.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes
or any Guarantee is due and payable, if the Issuers or a Guarantor will be obligated to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to such payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the
30th day prior to the date on which payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee is due
and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuers will deliver to the Trustee, with a copy
to the Paying Agent, an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay
such Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Issuers will promptly publish a notice in accordance with the provisions set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’
stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

In addition, the Issuers and the Guarantors will pay any present or future stamp, issuance,
registration, court, documentary, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes, charges and duties,
including without limitation, interest, penalties and other similar liabilities with respect thereto, imposed
by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of (i) the execution, issue, delivery or registration of the
Notes or any Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder, or (ii) the receipt of
any payments under or with respect to, or enforcement of, the Notes or any Guarantee.

42


-----

Upon written request, any of the Issuers or a Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee or a holder within a
reasonable time certified copies of tax receipts evidencing any payment by such Issuer or Guarantor (as the
case may be) of any Taxes imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, in accordance with the
procedures described in ‘‘—Notices’’ hereafter, in such form as provided in the normal course by the taxing
authority imposing such Taxes. If, notwithstanding the efforts of such Issuer or Guarantor to obtain such
receipts, the same are not obtainable, such Issuer or Guarantor will provide the Trustee or such holder
with other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or holder of such payments by such Issuer or
Guarantor. If requested by the Trustee, the Issuers and (to the extent necessary) any Guarantors will
provide to the Trustee such information as may be reasonably available to such Issuer and the Guarantors
(and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee) to enable determination of the amount of any
withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder(s).

Whenever the Indenture or this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ refers to, in any context, the payment of
principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note
(including payments thereof made pursuant to a Guarantee), such reference includes the payment of
Additional Amounts, if applicable.

The preceding provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and
shall apply _mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the_
District of Columbia) in which any successor person to any of the Issuers or Guarantors is organized,
resident or doing business for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which any such person (or
its agents, including the Paying Agent) makes any payment on the Note (or any Guarantee) and any
department, political subdivision or governmental authority of or in any of the foregoing having the power
to tax.

**Currency Indemnity**

U.S. dollars is the required currency (the ‘‘Required Currency’’) of account and payment for all sums
payable under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture. Any amount received or recovered in respect
of the Notes or the Guarantees in a currency other than the Required Currency (whether as a result of, or
of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution
of each Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Trustee or a holder of the Notes in respect of any sum
expressed to be due to such holder from the Issuers or the Guarantors will constitute a discharge of their
obligation only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency which the recipient is able to
purchase with the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of that receipt or
recovery (or, if it is not possible to purchase the Required Currency on that date, on the first date on which
it is possible to do so). If the amount of the Required Currency to be recovered is less than the amount of
the Required Currency expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuers or the Guarantors
will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any further purchase of the Required Currency in
an amount equal to such difference. For the purposes of this paragraph, it will be sufficient for the holder
to certify that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of the Required Currency been made
with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of
the Required Currency on that date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would have been
possible). These indemnities, to the extent permitted by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ other
obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder of a Note; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

**Optional Redemption**

**_Optional Redemption of Notes prior to April 30, 2022, upon Public Equity Offering_**

At any time prior to April 30, 2022, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuers
may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a
redemption price of % of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but
excluding) the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date), with the net cash proceeds from one or more Public
Equity Offerings. The Issuers may only do this, however, if:

(a) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that were initially issued would
remain outstanding immediately after the proposed redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 120 days after the closing of such Public Equity Offering.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent.

**_Optional Redemption of Notes prior to April 30, 2022_**

At any time prior to April 30, 2022, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuers
may also redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes being redeemed plus the Notes Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and unpaid
interest to the redemption date.

‘‘Notes Applicable Redemption Premium’’ means the greater of:

(1) 1.0% of the principal amount of the Notes; and

(2) the excess of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of (x) the redemption price of such Note at
April 30, 2022 (such redemption price being set forth in the table appearing below under the
caption ‘‘—Optional Redemption of Notes on or after April 30, 2022’’), plus (y) all required
interest payments due on such Note through April 30, 2022 (excluding accrued but unpaid
interest), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption
date plus 50 basis points; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Note.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of the Notes Applicable Redemption Premium shall not be a
duty or obligation of the Trustee or any Paying Agent.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent.

**_Optional Redemption of Notes on or after April 30, 2022_**

At any time on or after April 30, 2022 and prior to maturity, upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ notice, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the Notes. These redemptions will be in amounts of
$1,000 or integral multiples thereof at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of their
principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption
date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on April 30 of the years set forth below. This

44

redemption is subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record date that is prior to
the redemption date to receive interest due on an interest payment date.

**_Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

If, as a result of:

(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of
any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which is announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date
(or, where such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at a later
date, after such later date); or

(b) any change which is announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, where such
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at a later date, after such
later date) in the official application or official interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings
(including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court competent jurisdiction) of any
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

the Issuers would be obligated to pay, on the next date for any payment and as a result of that amendment
or change, Additional Amounts as described above under ‘‘—Additional Amounts’’ with respect to the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, which the Issuers cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to
it, then the Issuers may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes, at any time thereafter, upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (which notice shall be irrevocable and given in accordance with the
procedures described under ‘‘—Notices’’), at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption date. Prior to the giving of any
notice of redemption described in this paragraph, the Issuers will deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be
avoided by the Issuers’ taking reasonable measures available to it; and

(b) a written opinion of independent tax counsel to the Issuers of recognized standing qualified
under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to
the effect that the Issuers have or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive
and binding on holders of the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days
prior to the earliest date on which the Issuers would be obliged to make such payment of Additional
Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes, were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is
given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent.

45


-----

**Notice of Optional Redemption**

The Issuers will publish a notice of any optional redemption of the Notes described above in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Notices.’’ These notice provisions
include a requirement to publish any such notice in a newspaper having general circulation in Ireland
(which is expected to be _The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of_
Euronext Dublin, posted on the official website of Euronext Dublin if and so long as the Notes are listed
on Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require. The Issuers will inform Euronext Dublin of
the principal amount of the Notes that have not been redeemed in connection with any optional
redemption. If fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Notes will be selected by a
method that complies with the requirements, as certified to the Trustee by the Issuers, of the principal
securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed at such time, and in compliance with the
requirements of the relevant clearing system or, if the Notes are not listed on a securities exchange, or such
securities exchange prescribe no method of selection and the Notes are not held through a clearing system
or the clearing system prescribes no method of selection, by lot; _provided,_ _however, that no such partial_
redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Note not redeemed to less than $200,000.
Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable for any selections made in accordance with this
paragraph.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent.

**Sinking Fund; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuers are not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor may be
required to offer to purchase the Notes as described under ‘‘—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of
Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets.’’ The Parent Guarantor and
any Restricted Subsidiaries, including the Issuers, may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in
the open market or otherwise.

**Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs at any time, then the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must make an
offer (a ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) to each holder of Notes to purchase such holder’s Notes, at a
purchase price (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Price’’) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the ‘‘Change of
Control Purchase Date’’) (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant regular record dates that
are prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on an interest payment date).
Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the
Indenture.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor will:

(a) cause a notice of the Change of Control Offer to be (i) delivered to holders of the Notes
electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid; and (ii) if at the time of such notice
the Notes are listed on Euronext Dublin and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, published
in _The Irish Times (or another leading newspaper of general circulation in Ireland or, to the_
extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of Euronext Dublin, posted on the official
website of Euronext Dublin); and

46


-----

(b) send notice of the Change of Control Offer by first class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each
holder of Notes to the address of such holder appearing in the security register, which notice will
state:

(i) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred;

(ii) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control (including, but not
limited to, applicable information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and
capitalization after giving effect to the Change of Control);

(iii) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will
be a business day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is
mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange
Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations;

(iv) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control
Purchase Price is not paid;

(v) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(vi) any other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer
or to withdraw such acceptance (which procedures may also be performed at the office of the
paying agent in Ireland as long as the Notes are listed on Euronext Dublin).

The Trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes equal in principal amount to
any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Notes in global form or to each
holder of certificated Notes; provided that each such new Note or Notes will be in a total principal amount
of at least $200,000 and in minimum denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. The Issuers or
the Parent Guarantor will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made
in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is
made.

The ability of the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would
constitute a Change of Control could constitute a default under certain of our Credit Facilities or could
constitute a change of control under the Existing Ardagh Bonds. In addition, certain events that may
constitute a change of control under certain of our Credit Facilities or the Existing Ardagh Bonds may not
constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The Parent Guarantor’s future indebtedness and the
future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may also require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a
Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require a
repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if
the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuers or the Parent
Guarantor of such repurchase.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, neither the Issuers nor the Parent Guarantor can provide any
assurance that they will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all
the Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer.
If the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor fails to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the
Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would
give the Trustee and the holders of the Notes the rights described under ‘‘—Events of Default.’’

47


-----

Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the Parent
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the distribution of such funds or the prepayment of the Notes
prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor were not able to prepay any
indebtedness containing any such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the Issuers and the Parent
Guarantor would be unable to fulfill their repurchase obligations to holders of Notes who exercise their
right to redeem their Notes following a Change of Control, which would cause a Default under the
Indenture. A Default under the Indenture, unless waived by holders, would result in a cross-default under
certain of the financing arrangements described under ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’

Neither the Issuers nor the Parent Guarantor will be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Issuers or the Parent Guarantor and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or
not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a
Change of Control, the provisions of the Indenture will not give holders the right to require the Issuers or
the Parent Guarantor to repurchase the Notes in the event of certain highly leveraged transactions, or
certain other transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction and, in
certain circumstances, an acquisition by the Parent Guarantor’s management or its Affiliates, that may
adversely affect holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of
Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the
Indenture, including the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt.’’ The
existence of a holder of the Notes’ right to require the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor to repurchase such
holder’s Notes upon a Change of Control may deter a third party from acquiring the Parent Guarantor or
its Subsidiaries in a transaction which constitutes a Change of Control.

The Issuers and the Parent Guarantor will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations (including
those of Ireland) in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers and the Parent
Guarantor will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached their obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

‘‘Change of Control’’ means the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) the consummation of any transaction (including a merger or consolidation) the result of which is
that (i) any person or group, other than one or more Permitted Holders, is or as a result of such
transaction becomes, the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% (or so long as
any of the Existing Ardagh Bonds other than the August 2019 Notes remain outstanding, 35%) of
the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Parent Guarantor and (ii) the Permitted
Holders, individually or in the aggregate, do not beneficially own, directly or indirectly, a larger
percentage of the total voting power of such Voting Stock than such other person or group;

(b) the sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, consolidation or
transfer of the Parent Guarantor’s Voting Stock or in connection with a Permitted
Reorganization) of all or substantially all of the assets (other than Capital Stock, Debt or other
securities of any Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, to any person or group other than one or more Permitted
Holders;

(c) the Parent Guarantor or either Issuer is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or
dissolution other than in a transaction which does not violate the provisions described under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets’’ or in connection with a
Permitted Reorganization; or

48


-----

(d) the Parent Guarantor or any Surviving Entity ceases to beneficially own, directly or indirectly,
100% of the Voting Stock of either Issuer, other than director’s qualifying shares and other shares
required to be issued by law.

For the purposes of this definition, (i) ‘‘person’’ and ‘‘group’’ have the meanings they have in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act; (ii) ‘‘beneficial owner’’ is used as defined in Rules 13d-3 and
13d-5 under the Exchange Act, except that a person shall be deemed to have ‘‘beneficial ownership’’ of all
securities that such Person has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable immediately or only
after the passage of time; and (iii) a Person or group will be deemed to beneficially own all Voting Stock of
an entity held by a parent entity, if such Person or group is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of more than 35% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such parent entity and the
Permitted Holders, individually or in the aggregate, do not beneficially own, directly or indirectly, a larger
percentage of the total voting power of such Voting Stock than such Person or group.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, issue,
incur, assume, guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or
otherwise become responsible for, contingently or otherwise, the payment of (individually and
collectively, to ‘‘incur’’ or, as appropriate, an ‘‘incurrence’’), any Debt (including any Acquired
Debt); _provided that the Parent Guarantor, each Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary will be_
permitted to incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if in each case (a) after giving effect to the
incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis, no
Default or Event of Default would occur or be continuing and (b) at the time of such incurrence
and after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof,
on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the four full fiscal
quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the incurrence of
such Debt, taken as one period, would be greater than 2.0 to 1.0.

(2) This covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(a) the Notes issued on the Issue Date;

(b) the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt under Credit
Facilities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (i) $700,000,000 and
(ii) an amount equal to (I) 85% of Total Receivables _plus 70% of Total Inventories_ _less_
(II) $275,000,000;

(c) any Existing Debt of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt

(3) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Debt in U.S.
dollars where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Debt will be the
Dollar Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided that if any such Debt
denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to U.S.
dollars) covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in
U.S. dollars will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. The principal
amount of any Permitted Refinancing Debt incurred in the same currency as the Debt being
refinanced will be the Dollar Equivalent of the Debt refinanced determined on the date such
Debt being refinanced was initially incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant,
increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies will not be deemed
to exceed the maximum amount that an Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or a Subsidiary Guarantor
may incur under this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant.

(4) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’
covenant:

(a) obligations with respect to letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting
Debt otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount will not be included;

(b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions described under
‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ will not be treated as Debt;

(c) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the obligation to pay
commitment fees and the payment of interest in the form of additional preferred stock or
Debt will not be treated as Debt; and

(d) the reclassification of preferred stock as Debt due to a change in accounting principles will
not be treated as Debt.

(5) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Debt
described in this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, the Parent Guarantor, in its sole discretion, will
classify items of Debt and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Debt in
one of such clauses and the Parent Guarantor will be entitled to divide and classify an item of
Debt in more than one of the types of Debt described in this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, and
may change the classification of an item of Debt (or any portion thereof) to any other type of
Debt described in this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant at any time.

(6) The amount of any Debt outstanding as of any date will be:

(a) in the case of any Debt issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in
respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS;

(b) the principal amount of the Debt, in the case of any other Debt; and

52


-----

(c) in respect of Debt of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person,
the lesser of:

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Debt of the other Person.

_provided that any amount so paid or distributed to holders of Capital Stock of a Restricted_
Subsidiary other than the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary shall be included in
the calculation of the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments declared or made after

Cash Proceeds, and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable
securities, received after the Issue Date by the Parent Guarantor from the issuance or

originally sold for cash or Cash Equivalents, together with, in the case of both
clauses (x) and (y), the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Parent Guarantor
at the time of such conversion or exchange (excluding the Net Cash Proceeds from the
issuance of the Parent Guarantor’s Qualified Capital Stock or Deeply Subordinated
Funding financed, directly or indirectly, using funds borrowed from the Parent
Guarantor or any Subsidiary until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid); plus

Restricted Payment made after the Issue Date, an amount (to the extent not included in
Consolidated Adjusted Net Income) equal to the cash proceeds of such disposition or
repayment or the Fair Market Value of property received by the Parent Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary thereof, in either case, less the cost of the disposition of such
Investment and net of taxes, and (y) in the case of the designation of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary (as long as the designation of such Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary was deemed a Restricted Payment), the Fair Market Value of
the Parent Guarantor’s interest in such Subsidiary; provided that such amount will not in
any case exceed the amount of the Restricted Payment deemed made at the time that
the Subsidiary was designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; plus

the transfer of assets or provision of services, in each case having a value greater than the greater

Board of Directors (set out in an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee) resolving that such

contribution made pursuant to applicable legislation; provided, however, that any such payments

and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis and the related tax liabilities of the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved thereby;

create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind securing any Debt or assign or otherwise
convey any right to receive any income, profits or proceeds on or with respect to any of the Parent
Guarantor’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s property or assets constituting Collateral, whether owned at or
acquired after the Issue Date, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom other than Permitted
Collateral Liens.

The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind securing any Debt (except for Permitted Liens)
or assign or otherwise convey any right to receive any income, profits or proceeds on or with respect to any
of the Parent Guarantor’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s property or assets, including any shares of stock or
any Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary but excluding any Capital Stock, Debt or other securities of any
Unrestricted Subsidiary, whether owned at or acquired after the Issue Date, or any income, profits or
proceeds therefrom unless:

(a) in the case of any Lien securing Subordinated Debt, the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the
Notes (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Debt of a Guarantor) are
directly secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to the
Lien securing the Subordinated Debt until such time as the Subordinated Debt is no longer
secured by a Lien; and

(b) in the case of any other Lien, the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the Notes (or a Guarantee in
the case of Liens securing Debt of a Guarantor), and all other amounts due under the Indenture
are equally and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien.

**_Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets_**

(1) The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any
Asset Sale unless:

(a) the consideration the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset
Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold (as determined in good faith by
the Parent Guarantor’s Board of Directors);

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary
receives in respect of such Asset Sale consists of (i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds
received from the conversion within 90 days of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other
obligations received in consideration of such Asset Sale); (ii) Cash Equivalents; (iii) the
assumption by the purchaser of (x) the Parent Guarantor’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt) as a result of which neither the Parent Guarantor
nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such Debt or (y) Debt

59


-----

of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Sale, if the Parent Guarantor and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any
guarantee of such Debt as a result of such Asset Sale; (iv) Replacement Assets; (v) any
Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all
other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (b), not to exceed
the greater of $225,000,000 and 3.0% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such
Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated
Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value or (vi) a combination of the consideration specified in
clauses (i) to (v); and

(c) the Parent Guarantor delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee certifying that such
Asset Sale complies with the provisions described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b).

(2) If the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash
Proceeds from such Asset Sale, within 360 days after the consummation of such Asset Sale, may
be used by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary to (i) permanently repay, purchase
or prepay any then outstanding (A) Debt of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary
(and to effect a corresponding commitment reduction if such Debt is revolving credit borrowings)
owing to a Person other than the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent
secured by a Lien, (B) Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor owing to a Person
other than the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary or (C) any other Pari Passu Debt
other than the Existing Unsecured Notes or any other unsecured Debt that is guaranteed on a
subordinated basis, (ii) invest in any Replacement Assets, (iii) acquire all or substantially all the
assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after giving effect to any such
acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or
(iv) any combination of the foregoing; _provided that in the case of clause (ii), if the Parent_
Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, has entered into a binding
commitment in definitive form within such 360-day period to so apply such Net Cash Proceeds
with the good faith expectation that such Net Cash Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such
commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’), such binding
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of such Net Cash Proceeds; _provided,_
_further, that if any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before_
such Net Cash Proceeds are applied and after such initial 360-day period, then such Net Cash
Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below). The amount of such Net Cash
Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ The Parent
Guarantor may reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in
any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

(3) The Parent Guarantor or the Issuers may also at any time, and the Parent Guarantor or the
Issuers will within 20 Business Days after the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the
greater of $100,000,000 and 1.5% of Total Assets, make an offer to purchase (an ‘‘Excess
Proceeds Offer’’) from all holders of the Notes and from the holders of any Pari passu Debt
(which, in the case of Excess Proceeds which constitute proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of Collateral, were secured by a Lien on such Collateral), to the extent required by the
terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or
the agreements governing any such Pari passu Debt, the maximum principal amount (expressed
as an integral multiple of $1,000) of the Notes and any such Pari passu Debt that may be
purchased with the amount of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price as to each Note and any such
Pari passu Debt will be payable in cash in an amount equal to (solely in the case of the Notes)
100% of the principal amount of such Note and (solely in the case of Pari passu Debt) no greater

60


-----

than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Pari passu Debt,
plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari passu Debt
tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to
purchase the Notes and Pari passu Debt for general corporate purposes that are not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and any such Pari
passu Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount
of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari passu Debt to be purchased will be selected by
the Trustee on a pro rata basis (based upon the principal amount of the Notes and the principal
amount or accreted value of such Pari passu Debt tendered by each holder). Upon completion of
each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.

(4) If the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers are obligated to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the
Parent Guarantor or the Issuers will purchase the Notes and Pari passu Debt, at the option of the
holders thereof, in whole or in part (as an integral multiple of $1,000), on a date that is not earlier
than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is
given to such holders, or such later date as may be required under the Exchange Act; _provided_
that Notes of $200,000 will be purchased in full.

If the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers are required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Parent
Guarantor and the Issuers will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations, including any
securities laws of Ireland and the requirements of any applicable securities exchange on which
Notes or the Existing Ardagh Bonds are then listed. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, we will comply with
such securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations
described in this covenant by virtue thereof.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Parent Guarantor will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Issuer or a
Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for
the payment of any Pari passu Debt or Subordinated Debt of either Issuer (other than the Notes),
the Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(a) such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to
the Indenture providing for a Guarantee of payment of the Notes by such Restricted
Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such Debt; and

(b) with respect to any guarantee of Subordinated Debt by such Restricted Subsidiary, any such
guarantee shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee with respect to
the Notes at least to the same extent as such Subordinated Debt is subordinated to the
Notes.

This paragraph (1) will not be applicable to any guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary:

(i) existing on the Issue Date, guaranteeing Debt under Credit Facilities permitted to be
incurred pursuant to paragraphs (2)(b) and 2(m) of the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’ or guaranteeing Debt in an aggregate principal amount that is less
than the greater of $100,000,000 and 1.5% of Total Assets;

61


-----

(ii) that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee was not
incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary; or

(iii) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits
of not less than A500,000,000, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given,
of at least BBB+ or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least Baa1 or the equivalent
thereof by Moody’s, in connection with the operation of cash management programs
established for the Parent Guarantor’s benefit or that of any Restricted Subsidiary.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantee of the Notes created pursuant to the provisions
described in paragraph (1) above may provide by its terms that it will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(a) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person who is not the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary of all of the Capital Stock owned by the Parent Guarantor and its other Restricted
Subsidiaries in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary (which sale,
exchange or transfer is not prohibited by the Indenture); or

(b) (with respect to any Guarantee created after the Issue Date) the release by the holders of
the applicable Issuer’s, the Parent Guarantor’s or the Subsidiary Guarantor’s Debt described
in paragraph (1) above, of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any
deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Debt other than as a
result of payment under such guarantee), at a time when:

(i) no other Debt of either Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor has
been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(ii) the holders of all such other Debt that is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also
release their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release
upon payment in full of all obligations under such Debt other than as a result of
payment under such guarantee); or

(c) the release of the Guarantees on the terms and conditions and in the circumstances
described in ‘‘—Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees’’ and in ‘‘—The Guarantees—
Release of the Guarantees.’’

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Guarantor shall not be obligated to cause any such
Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee would reasonably be
expected to give rise to or result in (A) any violation of applicable law, rule, regulation or order that cannot
be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Parent Guarantor or such
Restricted Subsidiary, (B) personal liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary or (C) any significant cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes
but excluding any reasonable guarantee or similar fee payable to the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary) other than any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures
pursuant to clause (A) undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee, which cannot be avoided through
measures reasonably available to the Parent Guarantor or the Restricted Subsidiary; _provided,_ _however,_
that any Restricted Subsidiary who directly or indirectly, guarantees, assumes or in any other manner
become liable for the payment of any obligations under the Existing Ardagh Bonds shall also be required
to Guarantee payment of the Notes on the same terms as the guarantee of such obligations.

Each such additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose and corporate benefit, thin capitalization, distributable

62


-----

reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

**_Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual
encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its
Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Parent Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Parent Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Parent Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary.

(2) The provisions of the covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to:

Indenture, any Credit Facility, the indentures governing the Existing Ardagh Bonds, the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), the Senior Holdco
Notes and the security documents related thereto or by other indentures or agreements
governing other Debt we incur ranking equally with the Notes;

(b) any customary encumbrances or restrictions created under any agreements with respect to
Debt of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be incurred
subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ including encumbrances or restrictions imposed by Debt permitted
to be incurred under Credit Facilities or any guarantees thereof in accordance with such
covenant; provided that such agreements do not prohibit the payment of interest with respect
to the Notes or the Guarantees absent a default or event of default under such agreement;

(c) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement in effect on the Issue Date (other
than an agreement described in another clause of this paragraph (2));

(d) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above,
encumbrances and restrictions that restrict in a customary manner the subletting, assignment
or transfer of any properties or assets that are subject to a lease, license, conveyance or other
similar agreement to which the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party;

(e) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement or other instrument of a Person
(including its Subsidiaries) acquired by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary in
effect at the time of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which
encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any
Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired (including
its Subsidiaries);

(f) encumbrances or restrictions contained in contracts for sales of Capital Stock or assets
permitted by the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets’’ with
respect to the assets or Capital Stock to be sold pursuant to such contract or in customary
merger or acquisition agreements (or any option to enter into such contract) for the
purchase or acquisition of Capital Stock or assets or any of the Parent Guarantor’s
Subsidiaries by another Person;

63


-----

(g) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, any
customary encumbrances or restrictions pertaining to any asset or property subject to a Lien
to the extent set forth in the security document or any related document governing such
Lien;

(h) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by applicable law or regulation or by governmental
licenses, concessions, franchises or permits;

(i) encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
under contracts entered into the ordinary course of business;

(j) customary limitations on the distribution or disposition of assets or property in joint venture
agreements entered into the ordinary course of business and in good faith by any Restricted
Subsidiary; _provided that such encumbrance or restriction is applicable only to such_
Restricted Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries;

(k) in the case of clause (1)(d) above, customary encumbrances or restrictions in connection
with purchase money obligations, mortgage financings and Capitalized Lease Obligations for
property acquired in the ordinary course of business;

(l) any encumbrance or restriction arising by reason of customary non-assignment provisions in
agreements;

(m) encumbrances or restrictions with respect to any Permitted Receivables Financing; provided
that such encumbrances or restrictions are customarily required by the institutional sponsor

to the purchase of similar receivables in connection with the financing thereof;

(n) encumbrances or restrictions with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to a
Permitted Joint Venture;

(o) encumbrances or restrictions incurred in accordance with the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’; or

(p) any encumbrances or restrictions existing under any agreement that extends, renews,
amends, modifies, restates, supplements, refunds, refinances or replaces the agreements
containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (2)(a) through (o);
_provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are not_
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the holders of the Notes than those under or
pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, amended, modified, restated,
supplemented, refunded, refinanced or replaced.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request and direction of the Parent Guarantor and without the
consent of the holders of the Notes, in connection with the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any Permitted Debt, the Parent Guarantor, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Debt (or their duly authorized
representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement, in each case on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement or terms not violating the terms of the Indenture (for such
matters covered by the Indenture) or terms not affecting adversely the rights of the holders of the Notes in
material respects (for such matters not covered by the Indenture), including containing substantially the
same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests;
_provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the_
Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect

64


-----

the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the request and direction of the Parent Guarantor and without
the consent of the holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter
into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect
or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Debt covered by any such
agreement that may be incurred by an Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to any such agreement
(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Debt ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add
Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens,
(7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not violate the terms of the
Indenture. The Parent Guarantor shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into
any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders of the majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
‘‘Amendments and Waivers,’’ and the Parent Guarantor may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent
to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on
the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their
respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
holders of the Notes to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement
or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such_
transaction would comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to
have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, to enter into
any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any
Business Day upon prior written request at the offices of the Listing Agent.

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent Guarantor’s Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired
or newly established Subsidiaries) to be an ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’ only if no Default has occurred and
is continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such designation.

In the event of any such designation, the Parent Guarantor will be deemed to have made an
Investment constituting a Restricted Payment pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on
Restricted Payments’’ for all purposes of the Indenture in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net
book value of the Parent Guarantor’s interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS or
(ii) the Fair Market Value of the Parent Guarantor’s interest in such Subsidiary.

The Parent Guarantor’s Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary if (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of or will occur
and be continuing after giving effect to such designation and (ii) (x) the Parent Guarantor could incur at
least $1.00 of additional Debt under the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain

65


-----

Covenants—Limitation on Debt’’ or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such designation, in each case, on a pro forma basis taking into
account such designation.

Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Parent
Guarantor’s board of directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Parent
Guarantor’s Board of Directors with the Trustee giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the foregoing conditions, and giving the effective
date of such designation. Any such filing with the Trustee must occur within 45 days after the end of the
Parent Guarantor’s fiscal quarter in which such designation is made (or, in the case of a designation made
during the last fiscal quarter of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such
fiscal year).

**_Reports to Holders_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee:

(1) within 120 days (or, if the SEC has granted a longer period for the reporting of equivalent
information for companies required to make such public filings, such longer period as notified in
writing to the Trustee by the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers) after the end of the Parent
Guarantor’s fiscal year’s annual reports containing the following information: (a) audited
consolidated balance sheets of the Parent Guarantor as of the end of the two most recent fiscal
years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent
Guarantor for the two most recent fiscal years, including footnotes to such financial statements
and the report of the Parent Guarantor’s independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) an
operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of
material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (c) a description of the
business and management of the Parent Guarantor; and (d) material recent developments to the
extent not previously reported;

(2) within 60 days (or, if the SEC has granted a longer period for the reporting of equivalent
information for companies required to make such public filings, such longer period as notified in
writing to the Trustee by the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers) following the end of each of the
first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Parent Guarantor’s quarterly reports
containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as
of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the
quarterly and year-to-date periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and
the comparable prior year periods for the Parent Guarantor, together with condensed footnote
disclosure; (b) operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a
discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Parent
Guarantor and any material change between the current quarterly period and the corresponding
period of the prior year; and (c) material recent developments to the extent not previously
reported; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the
Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any change of the entire
Board of Directors, chairman of the Board of Directors, chief executive officer or chief financial
officer at the Parent Guarantor or change in auditors of the Parent Guarantor, a press release
containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor shall furnish to the holders of the Notes and to
prospective investors, upon the requests of such holders, any information required to be delivered

66


-----

pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are not freely transferable
under the Exchange Act by Persons who are not ‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

The Issuers or the Parent Guarantor will also make available copies of all reports furnished to the
Trustee (a) on the website of the Ardagh group of companies; and (b) through the newswire service of
Bloomberg, or, if Bloomberg does not then operate, any similar agency.

**_Financial Calculations_**

In the event that the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (w) incurs Debt to finance
an acquisition (including an acquisition of assets) or other transaction or (x) assumes Debt of Persons that
are, or secured by assets that are, acquired by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or
merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with, the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (y) commits to an acquisition or transaction pursuant to
which it may incur Acquired Debt or (z) is subject to a Change of Control, the date of determination of
Consolidated Adjusted Net Income, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Secured Debt Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the
Parent Guarantor, be (a) the date that a definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement for such
acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or Change of Control is entered into and the
Consolidated Adjusted Net Income, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Secured Debt Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving
pro forma effect to such acquisition, Change of Control and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with
the definitions of ‘‘Consolidated Adjusted Net Income’’, ‘‘Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio’’ and
‘‘pro forma’’, as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such ratios are exceeded as a result
of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated Adjusted Net Income of the
Parent Guarantor or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant acquisition or
Change of Control, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations
solely for purposes of determining whether such acquisition and any related transactions are permitted
hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such acquisition,
transaction, merger, amalgamation or consolidation; provided that if the Parent Guarantor elects to have
such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, put option or similar
arrangement, (i) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive
agreement, put option or similar arrangement is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes
of calculating any ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the
date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without
consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any
covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of such
acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition,
but any calculation of Consolidated Adjusted Net Income for purposes of other incurrences of Debt or
Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition
until it has been consummated unless such other incurrence of Debt or Liens is conditional or contingent
on the occurrence of such acquisition or Change of Control or (b) the date such Debt is borrowed or
assumed or such Change of Control occurs.

**_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_**

The Parent Guarantor will not, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, consolidate
or merge with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, or
take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by the Parent Guarantor’s Board of Directors or
shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to which the Parent Guarantor would dispose
of, all or substantially all of the Parent Guarantor’s properties and assets (other than Capital Stock, Debt

67


-----

or other securities of any Unrestricted Subsidiary) to any other Person or Persons and the Parent
Guarantor will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into any such transaction or series of
transactions if such transaction or series of transactions, in the aggregate, would result in the sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and
assets (other than Capital Stock, Debt or other securities of any Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to any other Person or Persons. The
previous sentence will not apply if:

(a) at the time of, and immediately after giving effect to, any such transaction or series of
transactions, either (i) the Parent Guarantor will be the continuing corporation or (ii) the Person
(if other than the Parent Guarantor) formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger or
to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially all
the properties and assets of the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis has been made (the ‘‘Surviving Entity’’) (x) will be a corporation duly
incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or
the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, any state
thereof, the District of Columbia, Canada, Switzerland, Australia or Bermuda and (y) will
expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the Parent
Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture and will assume the Parent
Guarantor’s obligations under the Security Documents, and the Notes, the Indenture and the
Security Documents will remain in full force and effect as so supplemented;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis
(and treating any obligation of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred in
connection with or as a result of such transaction or series of transactions as having been incurred
by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing;

(c) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of
transactions on a pro forma basis (on the assumption that the transaction or series of transactions
occurred on the first day of the four-quarter fiscal period immediately prior to the consummation
of such transaction or series of transactions with the appropriate adjustments with respect to the
transaction or series of transactions being included in such pro forma calculation), the Parent
Guarantor (or the Surviving Entity if the Parent Guarantor is not the continuing obligor under
the Indenture) could incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt under the provisions of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’;

(d) any Subsidiary Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, will
have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee will apply to such Person’s
obligations under the Indenture and the Notes;

(e) the Liens on Collateral shall remain in full force and effect securing the Notes and the
Guarantees, as applicable; and

(f) the Parent Guarantor or the Surviving Entity will have delivered to the Trustee, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate (attaching the computations to
demonstrate compliance with clause (c) above) and an opinion of independent counsel, each
stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other
disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such
supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements of the Indenture and that the Indenture
and the Notes constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the continuing person,
enforceable in accordance with their terms.

68


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, the Parent Guarantor may designate any
Person as a successor parent guarantor (the ‘‘Successor Parent Guarantor’’); _provided that the Parent_
Guarantor could have merged or amalgamated into such Person in accordance with the provisions hereof,
at the time of, and immediately after giving effect to such designation; provided, further, that such Successor
Parent Guarantor expressly assumes, by a supplemental indenture in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the
Parent Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture.

The Surviving Entity or Successor Parent Guarantor, as applicable, will succeed to, and be substituted
for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Parent Guarantor under the Indenture, but, in the case
of a lease of all or substantially all of the Parent Guarantor’s assets or in the case of the designation of a
Successor Parent Guarantor in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the Parent Guarantor will not be
released from the obligation to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, on the Notes.

Nothing in the Indenture will prevent (i) any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Parent Guarantor or any other
Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) any Subsidiary Guarantor from consolidating with, merging into or transferring
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Parent Guarantor, either Issuer or another
Subsidiary Guarantor (and upon any such transfer, the Guarantee of the transferring Subsidiary Guarantor
shall automatically be released; provided that if such Restricted Subsidiary is a party to any of the Security
Documents, arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee are made to maintain the Lien on Collateral granted
under such Security Documents) or (iii) the Parent Guarantor from appointing any Person as Successor
Parent Guarantor; provided that such appointment is made in accordance with the second paragraph of this
covenant above.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is
no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

The Parent Guarantor will publish a notice of any consolidation, merger or sale of assets described
above in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Notices’’ and, so long as the
rules of Euronext Dublin so require, notify such exchange of any such consolidation, merger or sale.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ‘‘Suspension Event’’), then, beginning on
that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the
following captions will not apply to such Notes: ‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted
Payments,’’ ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ ‘‘—Limitation
on Transactions with Affiliates,’’ ‘‘—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets,’’ ‘‘—Limitation on Guarantees
of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ ‘‘—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ and the provisions of clause (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets,’’ and, in each case, any related default
provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Parent Guarantor and
its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to
their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Parent Guarantor properly taken during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, and the ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant will be
interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no default will be deemed
to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On
the Reversion Date, all Debt incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at
the Parent Guarantor’s option, as having been incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant

69


-----

described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’ or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such
covenant (to the extent such Debt would be permitted to be incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date
and after giving effect to Debt incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion
Date). To the extent such Debt would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of
the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ such Debt will be deemed to have been outstanding
on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (2)(c) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt.’’

**Events of Default**

(1) Each of the following will be an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on
any Note;

(b) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at its Maturity
(upon acceleration, optional or mandatory redemption, if any, required repurchase or
otherwise);

(c) failure to comply with the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets’’;

(d) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Parent Guarantor or of any
Restricted Subsidiary that is contained in the Indenture or any Guarantees (other than
specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) above) and such failure continues for a period of 60 days or
more, in each case after the written notice specified in clause (2) below;

(e) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing the Debt of the Parent
Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary having an outstanding principal amount in excess of
the greater of (i) for so long as any Existing Ardagh Bonds other than the August 2019 Notes
remain outstanding, A75,000,000 and (ii) thereafter, the greater of $200,000,000 and 2.75%
of Total Assets, in each case, individually or in the aggregate, if that default: (x) results in the
acceleration of the payment of such Debt or (y) is caused by the failure to pay such Debt at
final maturity thereof after giving effect to the expiration of any applicable grace periods and
other than by regularly scheduled required prepayment, and such failure to make any
payment has not been waived or the maturity of such Debt has not been extended, and in
either case the total amount of such Debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds (i) for so long as
any Existing Ardagh Bonds other than the August 2019 Notes remain outstanding,
A75,000,000 and (ii) thereafter, the greater of $200,000,000 and 2.75% of Total Assets or its
equivalent at the time;

(f) any Guarantee ceases to be, or shall be asserted in writing by any Guarantor, or any Person
acting on behalf of any Guarantor, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in
accordance with its terms (other than as provided for in the Indenture, any Guarantee, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement);

(g) the Security Interests purported to be created under any Security Document will, at any
time, cease to be in full force and effect and constitute a valid and perfected Lien with the
priority required by the applicable Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement with respect to Collateral having a Fair Market
value in excess of (i) for so long the Existing Secured Notes other than the August 2019
Secured Notes remain outstanding, A75,000,000 and (ii) thereafter, the greater of
$150,000,000 and 2.0% of Total Assets for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture or in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or any

70


-----

Security Interest purported to be created thereunder is declared invalid or unenforceable or
the Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor granting Collateral the subject of any
such Security Interest asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any
such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and (but only in the event that such failure
to be in full force and effect or such assertion is capable of being cured without imposing any
new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Security Interest was not otherwise
subject immediately prior to such failure or assertion) such failure to be in full force and
effect or such assertion has continued uncured for a period of 15 days;

(h) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal and not covered by
insurance or indemnities) shall be rendered against the Parent Guarantor or any Material
Subsidiary, either individually or in an aggregate amount, in excess of (i) for so long as any
Existing Ardagh Bonds other than the August 2019 Notes remain outstanding, A75,000,000
and (ii) thereafter, the greater of $200,000,000 and 2.75% of Total Assets or its equivalent at
the time, and either a creditor shall have commenced an enforcement proceeding upon such
judgment, order or decree or there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days or more
during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, order or decree was not (by reason of
pending appeal or otherwise) in effect; and

(i) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization
with respect to the Parent Guarantor or any Material Subsidiary.

(2) If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (1)(i) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding by written notice to the Issuers and the Parent Guarantor (and to the Trustee if such
notice is given by the holders) may, and the Trustee, upon the written request of such holders,
shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued interest
on all of the outstanding Notes immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration all
such amounts payable in respect of the Notes will become immediately due and payable.

(3) If an Event of Default specified in clause (1)(i) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal
of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the
outstanding Notes shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of Notes.

(4) At any time after a declaration of acceleration under the Indenture, but before a judgment or
decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee, the holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Issuers, the
Parent Guarantor and the Trustee, may rescind such declaration and its consequences if:

(a) the Parent Guarantor or either Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient
to pay:

(i) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts on all Notes then outstanding;

(ii) all unpaid principal of and premium, if any, on any outstanding Notes that has become
due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate
borne by the Notes;

(iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest and
overdue principal at the rate borne by the Notes; and

(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel;

71


-----

(b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction; and

(c) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of amounts of principal of, premium, if
any, and any Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes that has become due solely by
such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

(5) The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
may, on behalf of the holders of all the Notes, waive any past defaults under the Indenture,
except a default:

(a) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on
any Note; or

(b) in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or
amended without the consent of the holders of 90% of the outstanding Notes.

(6) No holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the
Indenture or any remedy thereunder, unless the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes have made a written request to, and offered indemnity and/or
security (including by way of pre-funding) reasonably satisfactory to, the Trustee to institute such
proceeding as trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such
proceeding within 30 days after receipt of such notice and indemnity or security and the Trustee
within such 30-day period has not received directions inconsistent with such written request by
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Such limitations do
not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Note for the enforcement of the payment
of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after
the respective due dates expressed in such Note.

(7) If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and is known to a responsible officer
of the Trustee, the Trustee will mail to each holder of the Notes notice of the Default or Event of
Default within 15 Business Days after its occurrence. Except in the case of a Default or an Event
of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on
any Notes, the Trustee may withhold the notice to the holders of such Notes if its trust officers in
good faith determine that withholding the notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such
holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security
(including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss,
liability or expense.

(8) The Issuers and the Parent Guarantor are required to furnish to the Trustee annual statements as
to the performance of the Issuers, the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries under
the Indenture and as to any default in such performance. The Issuers and the Parent Guarantor
are also required to notify the Trustee within 15 Business Days of the occurrence of any Default
stating what action, if any, they are taking with respect to that Default.

(9) In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default as
described in clause (e) of paragraph (1) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of
acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to such clause (e) shall be remedied or cured,
or waived by the holders of the Debt that gave rise to such Event of Default, or such Debt shall

72


-----

have been discharged in full, within 20 days after the Event of Default arose and if (1) the
annulment of the acceleration (if applicable) of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment
or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the
Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or
waived.

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuers and the Parent Guarantor may, at their option and at any
time prior to the Stated Maturity of the Notes, elect to have the obligations of the Issuers, the Parent
Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes (‘‘Legal
Defeasance’’). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuers will be deemed to have paid and discharged the
entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due;

(b) the Issuers’ obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes,
replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in
respect of the Notes and segregate and hold such payments in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of either
Issuer, the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuers and the Parent Guarantor may, at their option and at any time, elect to have
the obligations of the Issuers, the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors released with respect to
certain covenants set forth in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’), and thereafter any omission to
comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ will no
longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. These events do not include events
relating to non-payment, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuers and the
Parent Guarantor may exercise their Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether they previously
exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in trust
with the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable
U.S. Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable U.S.
Government Securities, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an internationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay and discharge the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest, on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the
applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must
(i) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;
and (ii) if applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all of the
outstanding Notes of such principal, premium, if any, or interest;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered to the
Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that (x) the Issuers
have received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling,
or (y) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in
either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the beneficial

73


-----

owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered to
the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the
beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing (i) on the date of such
deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be
applied to such deposit) or (ii) insofar as bankruptcy or insolvency events described in
clause (1)(i) of ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above is concerned, at any time during the period ending
on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit;

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee for the Notes to have
a conflicting interest as defined in the Indenture;

(f) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing
of funds to be applied to such deposit), the Indenture or any material agreement or instrument to
which the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party or by which the Parent
Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary is bound;

(g) such defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit
constituting an investment company within the meaning of the U.S. Investment Company Act of
1940 unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder;

(h) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
independent counsel in the country of each Issuer’s or the Parent Guarantor’s incorporation to
the effect that after the 123[rd] day following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the
effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors’
rights generally and an opinion of independent counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee that
the Trustee shall have a perfected security interest in such trust funds for the ratable benefit of
the holders of the Notes;

(i) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor with the intent of
preferring the holders of the Notes over the other creditors of the Issuers or the Parent
Guarantor with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuers,
the Parent Guarantor or others, or removing assets beyond the reach of the relevant creditors or
increasing debts of the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor to the detriment of the relevant creditors;

(j) no event or condition shall exist that would prevent the Issuers from making payments of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the date of such deposit or at any time
ending on the 123[rd] day after the date of such deposit; and

(k) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the
Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

74


-----

If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when due because of any acceleration occurring
after an Event of Default, then the Issuers and the Guarantors will remain liable for such payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued
thereunder (except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of such Notes as expressly
provided for in the Indenture), when:

(a) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the
Trustee as funds in trust for such purpose an amount in cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government
Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and U.S. Government Securities, sufficient to
pay and discharge the entire Debt on such Notes that have not, prior to such time, been delivered
to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts
and accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes to the date of such deposit (in the case of Notes
which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case
may be and the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor has delivered irrevocable instructions to the
Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of such Notes at
Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be and either:

(i) all Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuers and thereafter repaid to the
Issuers or discharged from such trust as provided for in the Indenture) have been delivered
to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due
and payable (by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise), (y) will
become due and payable at Stated Maturity within one year or (z) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the Issuers’ name, and at the Issuers’ expense;

(b) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other amounts payable by
the Issuers under the Indenture; and

(c) the Issuers or the Parent Guarantor has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
opinion of counsel, each stating that:

(i) all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge
of all Notes under the Indenture have been satisfied; and

(ii) such satisfaction and discharge will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, the Indenture or any other agreement or instrument governed by the laws of
the State of New York to which either Issuer or any Subsidiary is a party or by which either
Issuer or any Subsidiary is bound.

**Amendments and Waivers**

The Indenture will contain provisions permitting the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee to enter
into a supplemental indenture without the consent of the holders of the Notes for certain limited purposes,
including, among other things, curing ambiguities, defects or inconsistencies, or making any change that
does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of the Notes in any material respect. With the consent of
the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, the
Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee are permitted to amend or supplement the Indenture; _provided_

75


-----

that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the Notes, only the
consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such
series shall be required. However, no such modification or amendment may, without the consent of the
holders of 90% of the outstanding Notes (provided, _however, that if any amendment, waiver or other_
modification will only affect one series of the Notes, only the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of such series shall be required (and not the consent of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding)), with respect to any such Notes held by a
non-consenting holder:

(a) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of or Additional Amounts or
interest on, any Note;

(b) reduce the principal amount of any Note (or Additional Amounts or premium, if any) or the rate
of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(c) change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Note or any premium or any Additional
Amounts or the interest thereon is payable;

(d) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated
Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

(e) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment,
supplement or waiver of provisions of the Indenture;

(f) modify any of the provisions relating to supplemental indentures requiring the consent of holders
of the Notes or relating to the waiver of past defaults or relating to the waiver of certain
covenants, except to increase the percentage of outstanding Notes required for such actions or to
provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the
consent of the holder of each Note affected thereby;

(g) make any change to the Intercreditor Agreement (and/or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or any provisions of the Indenture affecting the ranking of the Notes or the
Guarantees, in each case in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the holders of the Notes
or directly or indirectly release the Liens on the Collateral except as permitted by the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security
Documents; or

(h) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Additional Amounts’’
that adversely affects the rights of any holder of the Notes or amend the terms of the Notes or the
Indenture in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described
thereunder unless the Issuers or the Guarantors agree to pay Additional Amounts (if any) in
respect thereof in the supplemental indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of the Notes, the Issuers, the
Guarantors and the Trustee may modify, amend or supplement the Indenture:

(i) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Parent Guarantor and the assumption by
any such successor of the provisions in the Indenture and in the Notes; _provided that such_
successor Person would have been permitted to so succeed in a transaction that would have
complied with the provisions of ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of
Assets’’; provided, further, that such transaction need not be of a specific type identified in such
covenant (it being understood that in the case of any other transaction, the requirements of such
covenant shall apply mutatis mutandis);

76


-----

(ii) to add to the Issuers’ covenants and those of any Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Notes
for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Issuers or any Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Notes, as applicable, in the Indenture, in
the Notes or in any Guarantees;

respect;

claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will be represented by a global note in registered
form without coupons attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Note’’). The Notes sold to persons outside the
United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by a global note in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Note’’). The Rule 144A
Global Note and the Regulation S Global Note are collectively referred to as the ‘‘Global Notes.’’

The Rule 144A Global Note and the Regulation S Global Note will be deposited with a custodian for,
and registered in the name of, Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (the ‘‘Rule 144A Book-entry Interests’’) and in
the Regulation S Global Note (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-entry Interests’’ and, together with the Rule 144A
Book-entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC
or persons who hold interests through such participants. DTC will hold interests in the Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books
of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-entry
Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in the book-entry form by DTC and its participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including
certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery
of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own,
transfer or pledge Book-entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of
Book-entry Interests will not be considered the owners or ‘‘holders’’ of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC (or its respective nominee), will be considered the
sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on
the procedures of DTC, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants
through which they own Book-entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders
under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent nor the Registrar will have any responsibility,
or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-entry Interests.

The articles of association of the Issuers do not allow conversion of registered notes into notes in
bearer form.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC will redeem an equal
amount of the Book-entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book-entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC in connection with the redemption of
such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of DTC, if
fewer than all of a series of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-entry Interest of less than
$200,000 may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to DTC or its nominee, which will distribute such payments to participants

102


-----

in accordance with their customary procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under
‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.’’ If any such deduction or withholding is required to be
made, then, to the extent described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts’’ we will pay
additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global
Notes or owner of Book-entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts
that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-entry
Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-entry
Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuers and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the
Global Notes (i.e., DTC (or its nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and
for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the
Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of
the records of DTC or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of,
a Book-entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or any participant or
indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-entry Interest, or DTC or any
participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes, will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars.

**Action by Owners of Book-entry Interests**

DTC has advised the Issuers that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes
(including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more
participants to whose account the Book-entry Interests are credited and only in respect of such portion of
the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. DTC will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any
other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Indenture,
DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes in certificated form
(‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’) and to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC rules and will be
settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes
for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of securities
or to pledge such Notes, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the
normal procedures of DTC and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes for Rule 144A Book-entry Interests will have a legend to the effect set forth under
‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ Book-entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on
transfers and certification requirements discussed under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes
and the closing of the offering (the ‘‘Distribution Compliance Period’’), Regulation S Book-entry Interests
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note
only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a
certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person

103


-----

whom the transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and in accordance with all applicable securities
laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, Regulation S Book-entry Interests may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-entry Interest without
compliance with these certification requirements.

Rule 144A Book-entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S
or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities
Act).

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Notes and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Notes.

Any Book-entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-entry
Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable
to Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes:

   - if DTC notifies either Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a
successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or

  - if the owner of a Book-entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through DTC
following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note
may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the registrar or transfer agent. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive
Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part
transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred
or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; _provided that no Definitive_
Registered Note in a denomination less than $200,000, will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing,
printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a
period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the applicable
series of Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the applicable series of Notes or (iii) the date fixed for
selection of the applicable series of Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive
Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the applicable Indenture. We may require a holder
to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the applicable Indenture and the applicable
series of Notes.

104


-----

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is
surrendered to the registrar or at the office of the transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee, upon
receipt of an authentication order, will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and our requirements are met. Either Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of
both to protect us, the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any
loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for
any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is
about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by either Issuer pursuant to
the provisions of the Indenture, such Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers
to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

So long as the Notes are listed on Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, we will
publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation
in Ireland (which we expect to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such
rules, posted on the official website of Euronext Dublin (http://www.ise.ie).

**Information Concerning DTC**

DTC is:

  - a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law;

  - a ‘‘banking organization’’ under the New York Banking Law;

  - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

  - a ‘‘clearing corporation’’ within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

   - a ‘‘clearing agency’’ registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC
participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and
certain other organizations such as the Initial Purchaser. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers, trust
companies and clearing corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct
participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants.

Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants
and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the DTC system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may
be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that
certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Note only through DTC
participants.

The address of DTC in New York is 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041.

**TAXATION**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax
consequences, under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes
including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on sale or
redemption of the Notes or any interest thereon.

References in this discussion to Notes acquired, owned, held or disposed of by noteholders include,
except where otherwise expressly stated, the Book-entry Interests held by purchasers in the Notes in global
form deposited with a custodian for, and registered in the name of, Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.

**Ireland Taxation**

The following general summary describes the material Irish tax consequences of ownership of the
Notes and is based on the Irish tax law and published practice of the Revenue Commissioners as in effect
on the date of this Offering Memorandum and both are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect.
The following summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all Irish tax considerations relating to
the Notes. It relates to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and may
not apply to certain classes of persons such as financial institutions, dealers and certain tax-exempt bodies.
Holders of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers regarding the taxation implications of
acquiring, owning and disposing of the Notes.

**_Taxation of the Irish Issuer_**

The Irish Issuer has elected to be, and has been established with the intention of meeting the
requirements to be, taxable as a qualifying company pursuant to Section 110 of the Irish Taxes
Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended) (the ‘‘TCA 1997’’). Profits arising to the Irish Issuer shall be taxable
at a rate of 25%. The rules applicable in order to calculate this tax are generally the same as those
applicable to a regular trading company except in relation to certain payments of interest. Interest on the
Notes would be deductible for Irish tax purposes, where certain conditions are met.

All expenses that are not capital in nature and are wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the Irish
Issuer’s activities and are not specifically prohibited by statute will be deductible from income in order to
determine taxable profits. Any losses incurred by the Irish Issuer will be available for set-off against its
profits for any subsequent accounting period for so long as the Irish Issuer continues to be subject to the
Section 110 taxation regime.

**_Withholding Tax on Interest_**

In general, withholding tax at the standard rate of tax (currently 20%) must be deducted from Irish
source interest payments made by an Irish company. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on a
recognized stock exchange such as the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the Notes carry a
right to interest, the Notes will constitute ‘‘quoted Eurobonds’’. Under Section 64 of the TCA 1997 no
withholding for or on account of Irish income tax will be required to be made on interest arising on quoted
Eurobonds provided they meet the following criteria:

(a) they are held in a recognized clearing system,

(b) the interest is paid by or through a person who is not in Ireland (‘‘non-Irish paying agent’’), or

(c) the beneficial owner of the Notes is not resident in Ireland and has made all necessary
declarations in the prescribed form.

As the Notes will constitute ‘‘quoted Eurobonds’’ and meet the above criteria, there will be no
requirement to withhold tax.

106


-----

There is also an exemption for interest paid by a qualifying company (within the meaning of
Section 110 of the TCA 1997) to a person who is resident in another EU Member State or a country with
which Ireland has a tax treaty, except in a case where the interest is paid to a company in relation to a
business which that company carries on in Ireland through a branch or agency. The Irish Issuer has elected
to be treated as such a qualifying company.

No Irish withholding tax is payable in respect of a repayment of any principal amount of the Notes. No
Irish withholding tax is payable in respect of interest that does not have an Irish source and does not arise
to an Irish resident.

**_Charge to Irish Tax_**

Persons (individuals and companies) tax resident in Ireland are generally liable to Irish tax on their
worldwide income, including any income from the Notes.

In the case of persons that are individuals, interest will be liable to income tax at the marginal rate (up
to 40%). Such income will also be liable to the Universal Social Charge at rates of up to 11% depending on
the individual’s circumstances. Irish Pay Related Social Insurance contributions may also be payable. In the
case of corporate entities, the rate of corporation tax applying to the interest income is 25% (unless the
income constitutes trading income).

Interest paid by an Irish resident company to persons resident outside Ireland and who are resident in
a ‘‘relevant territory’’ is exempt from Irish income tax where the Notes constitute ‘‘quoted Eurobonds.’’ A
‘‘relevant territory’’ for this purpose is a Member State of the European Union (other than Ireland), or a
territory with which Ireland has entered into a double tax treaty.

Where interest is paid to or income, gains or discounts are realized by a person tax resident outside a
relevant territory, such Irish source income may be chargeable to Irish income tax. However, a company
(wherever resident) under the control of persons who are resident in a relevant territory and not under the
control of Irish residents should not be liable to Irish tax on interest arising on quoted Eurobonds. A
company (wherever resident) whose principal class of shares are quoted on a recognized stock exchange is
also not taxable on such interest on quoted Eurobonds. Ireland operates a self-assessment system in
respect of income taxes, corporation taxes, social insurance and the universal social charge. Any person
with Irish source income which is chargeable to Irish income tax comes within the scope of that system and
may have to file a return. A person not tax resident in Ireland should not be liable to Irish tax on non-Irish
source interest income.

**_Payments Under the Guarantee Arrangement_**

Any payments made by the Parent Guarantor under the Guarantee can be made without deduction of
Irish withholding tax where the Notes are quoted Eurobonds and meet the criteria set out above.

Such payments should not be subject to Irish tax in the hands of a recipient who is not tax resident in
Ireland and is resident in a relevant territory and where the amount received is not connected with a trade
carried on in Ireland by the recipient through a branch or agency. Persons who are resident outside a
relevant territory and in receipt of such payments may be chargeable to Irish tax. Any such person may
come within the scope of the self-assessment system and may have to file a return.

**_Encashment Tax_**

If the Paying Agent is not in Ireland, which is the case, then there is no obligation to deduct
encashment tax. If a person in Ireland were to pay the interest or receive the interest on behalf of a thirdparty, then Irish encashment tax (at the standard rate—currently 20%) would apply to amounts belonging
to Irish resident holders of the Notes, or non-Irish residents who hold Notes and who had not completed
the requisite non-resident declaration forms.

107


-----

In general, an automatic exemption from encashment tax exists on foreign dividends belonging to the
following Irish resident persons:

(a) approved charities,

(b) wholly exempt pension schemes, and

(c) an Investment Undertaking within the meaning of Section 739B TCA 1997.

**_Deposit Interest Retention Tax_**

The interest on the Notes will not be liable to Deposit Interest Retention Tax.

**_Capital Gains Tax_**

In the case of a person who is either tax resident or ordinarily tax resident in Ireland, the disposal or
redemption of the Notes may be liable to Irish capital gains tax at a rate of 33%. If the person is neither
resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland, such person will not be liable to Irish capital gains tax on the
disposal or redemption of the Notes for so long as the Notes are quoted on a stock exchange unless the
Notes are situated in Ireland and have been used in or for the purposes of a trade carried on by such
person in Ireland through a branch or agency, or which were used or held or acquired for use by or for the
purposes of the branch or agency.

**_Capital Acquisitions Tax_**

A gift or inheritance of the Notes will be within the charge to capital acquisitions tax where the donor
or the beneficiary in relation to the gift/inheritance is tax resident or ordinarily tax resident in Ireland on
the date of the gift or inheritance, or if the Notes are regarded as property situated in Ireland. Registered
instruments will be deemed to be situated in Ireland if the register is located in Ireland at the time of the
disposal or redemption. Special rules with regard to tax residence apply where an individual is not
domiciled in Ireland. Capital acquisitions tax is charged at a rate of 33% on the taxable value of the gift or
inheritance above a tax-free threshold.

**_Value Added Tax_**

There is no Irish Value added Tax (‘‘VAT’’) payable in respect of payments in consideration for the
issue of the Notes or for the transfer of a Note.

**_Stamp Duty_**

_Issuance of Instruments_

No stamp duty arises on the issuance of the Notes.

_Transfer of Notes_

No stamp duty is chargeable on a transfer of the Notes as they meet the following conditions for
exemption under Irish tax legislation:

(i) they do not carry a right of conversion into stocks or marketable securities (other than loan
capital) of a company having a register in Ireland or into loan capital having such a right;

(ii) they do not carry rights of the same kind as shares in the capital of the company, including rights
such as voting rights, a share in the profits or a share in the surplus upon liquidation;

(iii) they are issued for a price which is not less than 90% of the nominal value; and

108


-----

(iv) they do not carry a right to a sum in respect of repayment or interest which is related to certain
movements in an index or indices specified in any instrument or other document relating to such
loan capital.

**_FATCA and the CRS_**

_FATCA_

The U.S. developed an intergovernmental approach to the implementation of FATCA (as discussed in
‘‘—United States Federal Income Taxation—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act’’ below), which is
intended to reduce the burden for Financial Institutions (‘‘FIs’’) of complying with FATCA. The Irish and
U.S. governments signed an intergovernmental agreement (‘‘Irish IGA’’) on December 12, 2012. Under the
Irish IGA, information about relevant U.S. investors will be provided on an annual basis by each Irish FI
(unless the FI is exempted from the FATCA requirements) directly to the Irish Revenue Commissioners,
who will then provide such information to the U.S. tax authorities.

_CRS_

The Common Reporting Standard (‘‘CRS’’) requires participating jurisdictions to exchange certain
information held by financial institutions regarding their non-resident customers. Over 100 jurisdictions,
including Ireland, have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and the first data exchanges
took place in September 2017. CRS does not impose any additional requirements to withhold tax on
payments to investors.

_Reporting Obligations under FATCA and the CRS_

A common feature of both FATCA and the CRS is that entities that are classified as ‘‘Financial
Institutions’’ are required to identify their investors and in certain circumstances report information to
their local tax authorities (for onward reporting to overseas tax authorities, in the case of CRS, and for
onward reporting to the U.S. tax authorities, in the case of FATCA).

The Irish Revenue Commissioners have issued regulations and guidance notes making compliance
with the Irish provisions implementing CRS and FATCA mandatory. As a result, Irish entities that are
classified as ‘‘Financial Institutions’’ in accordance with FATCA and CRS have obligations in respect of the
Irish law implementing CRS and FATCA.

On the basis that the Irish Issuer does not fall within the definition of ‘‘Financial Institution’’ for
FATCA and CRS purposes, it should not have any reporting obligations under FATCA or CRS. However,
there may be still FATCA or CRS reporting applicable to the Notes by persons other than the Irish Issuer
but this will be dependent upon various factors such as the entities from which the Noteholders will
directly receive interest on the Notes, the rules applicable in the jurisdictions of these entities, where the
ultimate beneficial owners of the Notes are resident and their FATCA and CRS status.

**_Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive_**

The Council of the European Union (the ‘‘Council’’) adopted the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (the
‘‘ATAD’’) on 12 July 2016. The ATAD establishes minimum standards with respect to taxation in certain
areas including hybrid mismatches and interest deductibility limitation. While the hybrid mismatch
provisions were transposed into Irish law effective from 1 January 2020, uncertainty remains. There is
ongoing interaction between the Revenue Commissioners and industry with a view to producing guidance
and clarity on their application. The interest deductibility limitation under ATAD has not yet been
transposed into Irish law. The ATAD may affect the tax treatment of the Issuer. However, in the absence
of Revenue Commissioner guidance and further implementing legislation, the implications of the ATAD
are unclear as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**Luxembourg Taxation**

The following summary is of a general nature and is included herein solely for information purposes.
It is based on the laws presently in force in Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be
construed to be, legal or tax advice. Prospective investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own
professional advisers as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to
which they may be subject. In particular, the summary does not take account of the application of any
double taxation treaty that may apply in any given situation.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in this section to a tax, duty, levy, impost
or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only.
Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impˆot sur
_le revenu des collectivit´es), municipal business tax (impˆot commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge_
(contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax (impˆot sur le revenu) generally.
Investors may further be subject to net wealth tax (impˆot sur la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or
taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax, net wealth tax as well as the solidarity surcharge
invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers
are generally subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances,
where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business
undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Taxation of the Holders of Notes_**

_Withholding Tax_

Except as provided for by the Luxembourg law of 23 December 2005 (the ‘‘Law of 23 December
2005’’) introducing a domestic withholding tax on certain interest payments to Luxembourg resident
individuals, under the existing laws of Luxembourg there is no withholding tax on payments of principal,
premium or interest, or on accrued but unpaid interest, in respect of the Notes, nor is any Luxembourg
withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the Notes.

According to the Law of 23 December 2005, interest payments on the Notes paid by a paying agent
established in Luxembourg would be subject to a compulsory withholding tax of 20% (the ‘‘20%
withholding tax’’) if such payments are made for the immediate benefit of individuals resident in
Luxembourg. The 20% withholding tax is levied by the aforementioned paying agent.

In the event that interest is paid to a Luxembourg resident individual by a paying agent established in
an EU Member State other than Luxembourg, or EEA State, the beneficiary may opt for the application of
the 20% withholding tax in accordance with the Law of 23 December 2005 (the ‘‘20% tax’’). The 20% tax is
paid and declared by the beneficiary.

The 20% withholding tax and the 20% tax will operate a full discharge of income tax for Luxembourg
resident individuals acting in the context of the management of their private wealth.

As of 1 January 2015, all interest payments made or ascribed by a Luxembourg paying agent to or for
the immediate benefit of individuals resident are subject to the automatic exchange of information
between Luxembourg and the relevant Member States.

**_Income Taxation_**

_Non-Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes_

A non-Luxembourg tax resident holder of Notes, not having a permanent establishment or a
permanent representative in Luxembourg to which such Notes are attributable, is not subject to
Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under

110


-----

the Notes. A gain realized by such non-resident holder of Notes on the sale or disposal, in any form
whatsoever, of the Notes is further not subject to Luxembourg income tax to the extent the Notes are not
attributable to a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg.

A non-Luxembourg tax resident corporate holder of Notes or an individual holder of Notes acting in
the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, who has a permanent
establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which such Notes are attributable, is
subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue
discounts, under the Notes and on any gains realized upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of
the Notes.

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes_

A corporate holder of Notes tax resident in Luxembourg must include any interest accrued or
received, any redemption premium or issue discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in
any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.
The same inclusion applies to an individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking.

A holder of Notes that is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 organizing private family asset holding
companies (Soci´et´e de Gestion de Patrimoine Familiale), or by the laws of December 17, 2010 on
undertakings for collective investment and February 13, 2007 (SIF), or by the law of July 23, 2016 on
reserved alternative investment funds (RAIF), is neither subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of
interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, nor on gains realized on the sale
or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes. A Soci´et´e de Gestion de Patrimoine Familiale is however
subject to an annual subscription tax of 0.25% (the minimum subscription tax amounts to A100 and the
maximum to A125,000). A Holder of Notes that is governed by the law of July 13, 2005 (SEPCAV &
ASSEP), as amended, is subject to Luxembourg income tax, but there are exemptions available for certain
kinds of income.

An individual Luxembourg tax resident holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of
his/her private wealth, is subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption
premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes, except if withholding tax has been levied on such payments
in accordance with the Law of December 23, 2005 (as this withholding tax would represent the final tax
liability in his/her hands). A gain realized by a Luxembourg tax resident individual holder of Notes, acting
in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, upon the sale or disposal, in any form
whatsoever, of Notes is not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal took place
more than six months after the Notes were acquired. However, any portion of such gain corresponding to
accrued but unpaid interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax (in case it would not have
suffered the 20% withholding tax under the Law of December 23, 2005).

In addition, pursuant to the Luxembourg law of July 17, 2008, Luxembourg tax resident individuals,
acting in the course of their private wealth, can opt to self declare and pay a 20% tax on interest payments
made after December 31, 2007 by certain paying agents not established in Luxembourg (defined in the
same way as in the EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC), i.e., paying agents located in an EU Member State
other than Luxembourg, a member state of the European Economic Area or in a state which has
concluded an international agreement directly related to the EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC. If this
option is exercised, such interest does not need to be reported in the annual tax return.

**_Net Wealth Taxation_**

A corporate holder of Notes, if it is resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes or, if not, where it
maintains a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which such Notes
are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax on the fair value of such Notes, except if the

111


-----

holder of such Notes is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 organizing private family asset holding
companies (Soci´et´e de Gestion de Patrimoine Familiale), or by the laws of December 17, 2010, on
undertakings for collective investment and February 13, 2007 (SIF), or by the law of July 23, 2016 on
reserved alternative investment funds (RAIF), as amended, or July 13, 2005 (SEPCAV & ASSEP), on
undertakings for collective investment or is a securitization company governed by the law of March 22,
2004 on securitization, or the Luxembourg law of 15 June 2004 relating to the investment company in risk
capital (‘‘SICAR’’).

An individual holder of Notes, whether or not he/she is tax resident of Luxembourg, is not subject to
Luxembourg wealth tax on such Notes.

**_Other Taxes_**

Neither the issuance nor the transfer of Notes will give rise to any Luxembourg stamp duty, capital
duty, value added tax, issuance tax, registration tax, transfer tax or similar taxes or duties, provided that the
relevant issue or transfer agreement is not submitted to registration (directly or as an annex) in
Luxembourg which is not mandatory.

However, a registration duty may be due in case where (i) any document in relation to the Notes
amongst other issue or transfer agreement, is either enclosed (annex´e) to a deed subject to a mandatory
registration in Luxembourg (e.g., public deed) or lodged with a notary’s records (d´epos´e au rang des
_minutes d’un notaire), or (ii) a registration of the Notes or any document in relation therewith (e.g., issue or_
transfer agreement) is made on a voluntary basis. Depending on the nature of the documents, an ad
valorem or a fixed registration duty may be due. Generally, under the current Luxembourg administrative
practice, no ad valorem registration duties are levied on the transfer of a bond or any other negotiable
security (excluding a transfer of interest in a partnership holding Luxembourg real estate property).

In the event the Notes are presented voluntarily or mandatorily to a Luxembourg Court or to an
‘autorit´e constitu´ee’, registration may be required, which is subject to registration duty on the document.
Depending on the nature of the documents, the registration of the Notes would be subject to an ad valorem
registration duty of 0.24 per cent, calculated on the amounts mentioned therein. If the Notes are annexed
or referred to in a deed signed before a Luxembourg notary public that will be registered, the Luxembourg
authorities may decide to levy the 0.24 per cent duty if the conditions to levy the duty are fulfilled.

Where a holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the
Notes are included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of Notes if embodied in a Luxembourg deed or recorded in
Luxembourg.

Subscription tax implications may arise (depending on the facts and circumstances) for the following
Luxembourg based entities:

  - private family asset holding companies governed by the law of May 11, 2007; or

  - investment funds governed by the laws of December 20, 2002 (as amended), December 17, 2010
and February 13, 2007 (SIF) and Law of July 23, 2016. For investment funds, the subscription tax is
levied on the total net assets of the fund evaluated on the last day of each quarter. The tax is
payable quarterly in advance, if applicable on a pro-rata basis.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as
FATCA, a ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ may be required to withhold on certain payments they make
(‘‘foreign passthru payments’’) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting, or related
requirements.

112


-----

A number of jurisdictions (including Luxembourg) have entered into intergovernmental agreements
with the United States to implement FATCA (‘‘IGAs’’), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in
their jurisdiction. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an
IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that
it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the
Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect
to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if
withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments
such as the Notes, such withholding would apply no earlier than two years after issuance of final
regulations by the IRS defining the term ‘‘foreign passthru payment’’.

A foreign financial institution resident in an IGA jurisdiction must comply with specific due diligence
procedures to identify its account holders and provide the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (directly or
indirectly through its local tax authority) with information on financial accounts held by U.S. persons and
recalcitrant account holders.

Consequently, holders of the Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications
to any financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made.

Holders of the Notes should consult their professional advisors on the individual impact of FATCA.

**_Automatic Exchange of Information_**

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (‘‘OECD’’) has developed a common
reporting standard (‘‘CRS’’) to achieve a comprehensive and multilateral automatic exchange of
information on a global basis. A number of jurisdictions (including Luxembourg) signed the OECD’s
multilateral competent authority agreement (‘‘Agreement’’) to automatically exchange information under
the CRS.

The CRS requires certain financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts
(which may include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due
diligence procedures. A jurisdiction that has signed the Agreement may provide this information to other
jurisdictions that have signed the Agreement.

Consequently, holders of the Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications
to any financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made.

Holders of Notes should consult their professional advisors on the individual impact of CRS.

**Investors should consult their professional advisors on the possible tax and other consequences with**
**respect to the implementation of the CRS.**

**United States Federal Income Taxation**

The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant
with respect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This summary applies only to
holders who purchase Notes for cash in this offering at the applicable price indicated on the cover of this
Offering Memorandum and who will hold such notes as capital assets. It does not purport to be a
comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase
Notes. In particular, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that may be
subject to special tax rules including, without limitation, the following: (i) banks or other financial
institutions; (ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in securities; (iv) tax-exempt entities;
(v) persons who will hold a Note as part of a ‘‘hedging’’ or ‘‘conversion’’ transaction or as a position in a
‘‘straddle’’ or as part of a ‘‘synthetic security’’ or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; (vi) U.S. Holders (as defined below) who have a ‘‘functional currency’’ other than the U.S.

113


-----

dollar; (vii) regulated investment companies; (viii) partnerships and other pass-through entities (and
investors therein); (ix) persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the
United States; (x) U.S. Holders who hold Notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S.
intermediary; and (xi) persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income
with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an ‘‘applicable financial statement’’ (as defined in
Section 451 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’)). Further, this summary
does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax consequences other than
U.S. federal income tax consequences (such as, U.S. federal estate and gift tax consequences, or the
Medicare tax on certain investment income) or any U.S. state and local or foreign tax consequences of
acquiring, owning or disposing of the Notes.

This summary is based on the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. All of the foregoing are subject to
change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below.

For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation,
or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof, or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income
taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996 and has
properly elected to continue to be treated as a U.S. person.

For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘Non-U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is neither a
U.S. Holder nor a partnership (or other entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes holds a Note, the tax treatment of a partner in or owner of the partnership or other
pass-through entity will generally depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the activities of the
entity. A person that is a partner in a partnership or other pass-through entity that is considering investing
in a Note should consult its own tax adviser.

Each prospective investor should consult its own tax adviser with respect to the U.S. federal (including
income, Medicare, estate and gift), state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning and
disposing of a Note. Holders should also review the discussion under ‘‘—Ireland Taxation’’ for the Irish tax
consequences to a holder of the ownership of the Notes.

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated principal on a Note
or retire the Notes before their stated maturity dates, see for instance ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control.’’ Notwithstanding these possibilities, we do not believe that
the Notes are contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and,
consequently, we do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments. If,
notwithstanding our view, the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, a holder subject
to U.S. federal income taxation generally would be required to accrue ordinary income at a rate in excess
of the stated interest rate on the Notes and to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain
recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes
that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

This discussion assumes that the Notes will be issued with no more than a _de minimis amount of_
original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This will be the case if the excess, if
any, of the stated principal amount of the Notes over the issue price of the Notes is less than .25% of the

114


-----

stated principal amount of the Notes, multiplied by the number of complete years from the issue date to
maturity of the Notes. U.S. Holders of Notes issued with more than a de minimis amount of OID generally
will be required to include such OID in income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to
maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of any cash attributable to such OID, regardless of their regular
method of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to them if the Notes are
issued with OID.

**_Source of Interest Payments_**

For certain U.S. federal income tax purposes (including for purposes of the foreign tax credit rules
and the withholding tax rules (including FATCA), as discussed below), the source of the interest income
received by a holder with respect to the Notes should depend on which Issuer makes the interest payment.
However, the clearing systems require us to designate only one Issuer for U.S. federal withholding tax
purposes, and we intend to designate Ardagh Holdings USA as the issuer of the Notes for this purpose. As
such, an applicable withholding agent likely will treat all interest payments on the Notes as U.S. source for
U.S. federal withholding tax purposes.

**_U.S. Holders_**

_Payments of Stated Interest_

Stated interest paid on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at
the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

For most U.S. Holders, interest income with respect to the Notes will constitute ‘‘passive category’’
income, which may be relevant in calculating the U.S. Holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. The rules
governing foreign tax credits are complex and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisers regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances.

_Disposition of the Notes_

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on
such disposition (except to the extent any amount realized is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated
interest, which is taxable as described under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’) and the U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will be the cost at which the U.S. Holder acquires such
Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note will include the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any other property received for such
Note.

Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of a Note will be U.S. source capital gain
or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one
year at the time of its disposition. For certain non-corporate holders (including individuals), any such
long-term capital gain is subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.

_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_

Certain U.S. Holders may be required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes,
subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for notes held in accounts maintained by certain U.S.
financial institutions). U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, of this

115


-----

legislation on their ownership and disposition of the Notes including the significant penalties for
non-compliance with this requirement.

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments to U.S. Holders of
interest on the Notes and to the proceeds of a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition (including a
retirement or redemption) of a Note. Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) may be required on
such amounts if the U.S. Holder fails (i) to furnish the U.S. Holder’s taxpayer identification number, (ii) to
certify that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding as a result of a prior failure to report
interest or dividends or (iii) to otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules. Certain exempt U.S. Holders (including, among others, corporations) are not subject to
the backup withholding and information reporting requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, _provided that the required_
information is timely furnished to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’).

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

_Payments of Stated Interest_

As discussed above under ‘‘—Source of Interest Payments,’’ an applicable withholding agent likely will
treat all payments on the Notes as U.S. source.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, to the extent that payments of
interest on the Notes are treated as paid from U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes, neither
U.S. federal income tax nor the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax on U.S. source interest will apply to any
payment of interest on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder provided that:

   - interest paid on a Note is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade
or business in the United States;

  - the Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined
voting power of all classes of Ardagh Holdings USA’s stock that are entitled to vote within the
meaning of section 871(h)(3) of the Code;

  - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank whose receipt of interest on a Note is described in
section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code;

  - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to Ardagh Holdings
USA (actually or constructively) through stock ownership; and

   - (1) the Non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address, and certifies, under penalties of perjury,
that it is not a U.S. person (which certification may be made on an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS
Form W-8BEN-E, or other applicable form) or (2) the Non-U.S. Holder holds the Note through
certain foreign intermediaries or certain foreign partnerships, and the Non-U.S. Holder and the
foreign intermediary or foreign partnership satisfies the certification requirements of applicable
U.S. Treasury regulations.

If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest (to the
extent treated as paid from U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will be subject to the 30%
U.S. federal withholding tax, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides us with a properly executed (1) IRS
Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or

116


-----

other applicable form) stating that interest paid on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is
effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the Notes
is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, then, although the Non-U.S. Holder will
be exempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax (provided the requirement to deliver an IRS
Form W-8ECI, or other appropriate IRS Form W-8, is satisfied), the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis generally in the same manner as if the
Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In
addition, if a Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, it may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or
lesser rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the portion of its earnings and profits for the taxable
year, subject to adjustments, that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the
United States.

_Disposition of the Notes_

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, upon the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax or U.S. federal withholding tax on any gain recognized unless:

(1) that gain is effectively connected with a Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the
United States; or

(2) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in
the taxable year of that disposition and certain other conditions are met.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is described in clause (1) above, it will be subject to tax on the net gain derived
from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (and possible branch profits
tax) in generally the same manner as discussed above with respect to effectively connected interest. If a
Non-U.S. Holder is an individual described in clause (2) above, such holder will be subject to a flat 30% tax
on the gain derived from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, which
may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise).

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

Generally, the amount of U.S. source interest paid to Non-U.S. Holders and the amount of tax, if any,
withheld with respect to those payments must be reported annually to the IRS and to Non-U.S. Holders.
Copies of the information returns reporting such interest and withholding also may be made available to
the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions of an applicable
income tax treaty.

In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%)
with respect to payments of interest on the Notes, provided the statement described above in the last bullet
point under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’ has been received and we do not have actual knowledge or
reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person, as defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient.
In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to information reporting and, depending on the
circumstances, backup withholding with respect to payments of the proceeds of the sale or other taxable
disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note within the United States or conducted
through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless the statement described above has been
received, and we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that a holder is a U.S. person, as defined
under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient, or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an
exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules from a payment to a Non-U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S.

117


-----

Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, provided that the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (such sections
and regulations commonly referred to as ‘‘FATCA’’), when applicable, will impose a U.S. federal
withholding tax of 30% on certain types of payments, including payments of U.S. source interest, made to
(i) a ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner)
unless such institution agrees to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding its direct and
indirect U.S. account holders or (ii) a ‘‘non-financial foreign entity’’ (as the beneficial owner or as an
intermediary for the beneficial owner) unless such entity certifies that it does not have any ‘‘substantial
United States owners’’ (as defined in the Code) or furnish identifying information regarding each
substantial United States owner (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN-E). In certain
circumstances, the relevant foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity may qualify for an
exemption from these rules, which exemption is typically evidenced by providing appropriate
documentation (such as an IRS Form W-8BEN-E). In addition, an intergovernmental agreement between
the United States and the jurisdiction of a foreign financial institution may modify these rules.

You are urged to consult your own tax advisers regarding FATCA and the application of these
requirements to your investment in the Notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement dated the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Initial Purchaser has agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to the Initial
Purchaser, $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchaser to purchase the Notes
are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The Initial Purchaser must
purchase all of the Notes if it purchases any of the Notes.

The Initial Purchaser proposes to resell the Notes at the offering prices set forth on the cover page of
this Offering Memorandum within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S.
persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. The price at which the Notes are offered
may be changed at any time without notice.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act
or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

The Initial Purchaser may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of the Notes,
as applicable, in jurisdictions in which they are otherwise not permitted.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of the Notes within
the United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with
Rule 144A.

The Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

(i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to
be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by them in connection with the issuance or sale of
the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuers or
any Guarantor; and

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by them in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2020, which
will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred
to as ‘‘T+ ‘‘). Under Rule 15-c61 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally
are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the day of pricing or the succeeding
business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle in T+
to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of
the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the day of pricing or the next succeeding business
days should consult their own advisers.

Application will be made for listing particulars to be approved by Euronext Dublin and for the
Secured Notes and the Senior Notes to be admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted
to trading on its Global Exchange Market. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the Notes will sell
in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading
market for the Notes will continue after this offering. The Initial Purchaser has advised us that it currently
intends to make a market in the Notes. However, it is not obligated to do so, and it may discontinue any

119


-----

market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time without notice. In addition, market-making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act and may be limited. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that you will be able to sell the Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you
receive when you sell will be favorable.

In connection with this offering, the Initial Purchaser is not acting for anyone other than us and will
not be responsible to anyone other than us for providing the protections afforded to their clients or for
providing advice in relation to this offering.

Buyers of the Notes sold by the Initial Purchaser may be required to pay stamp taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the initial
offering price set forth on the cover of this Offering Memorandum.

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchaser may purchase and sell notes in the open market.
Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and
stabilizing purchases.

  - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the Initial Purchaser of a greater number of notes
than it is required to purchase in the offering.

   - Covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions.

   - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a
specified maximum.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the Initial
Purchaser for its own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price
of the Notes. It may also cause the price of the Notes, as applicable, to be higher than the price that would
otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The Initial Purchaser may conduct
these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the Initial Purchaser commences any of
these transactions, it may discontinue them at any time.

The Initial Purchaser is a full service financial institution engaged in various activities, which may
include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchaser and
its respective affiliates have in the past, and may in the future, perform commercial banking, investment
banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and
reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services
for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and
reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchaser
and its respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and
equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans
and/or credit default swaps) for its own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any
time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities
activities may involve our securities and instruments. The Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may receive
allocations of the Notes.

Affiliates of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. serve as trustee under the Existing Notes, security agent
under the Existing Secured Notes and administrative agent under the ABL Facility, and have received, or
may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. The Initial Purchaser or
its affiliates, as applicable, are or will be hedging counterparties with Ardagh. Typically, such Initial
Purchaser or its affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either
the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially
the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial

120


-----

Purchaser and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. The
Initial Purchaser holds or in the future may hold certain of the Existing Notes to be repurchased with a
portion of the proceeds of this offering and as a result may receive proceeds from the issuance of the Notes
in their capacities as holders of such notes.

We have agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchaser against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the U.S. Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the Initial Purchaser may be required to make
because of any of those liabilities.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or

**LEGAL MATTERS**

Certain legal matters with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees are being passed upon for us by
Shearman & Sterling (London) LLP, U.S. federal and New York counsel to the Issuers and Guarantors,
William Fry, Irish counsel to the Issuers and the Guarantors and Elvinger Hoss Prussen, Luxembourg
counsel to the Issuers and the Guarantors. Certain legal matters with respect to the offering of the Notes
will be passed upon for the Initial Purchaser by Cahill Gordon & Reindel (UK) LLP, U.S. federal and New
York counsel to the Initial Purchaser and McCann FitzGerald, Irish counsel to the Initial Purchaser.

**INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS**

The audited consolidated financial statements of Ardagh Group S.A. and its subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019
incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers,
Dublin, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing herein.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

Ardagh Packaging Finance, a co-issuer of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Ireland, the
Parent Guarantor of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Upon issuance, the Notes
will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and on or prior to the date required by the Indenture, the
Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Parent
Guarantor and most of the Subsidiary Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of one of many
non-U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and such
Guarantors live outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Ardagh Packaging Finance and
the Guarantors (other than the Subsidiary Guarantors in Delaware (United States)), and substantially all
of the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, it
may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons in the United States or to enforce judgments
obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the
United States. In addition, local counsel have informed us that it is questionable whether a foreign court
would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced predicated solely upon
U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against any Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, any Subsidiary
Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. We have been advised by
counsel that there is doubt that a lawsuit based upon United States federal or state securities laws could be
brought in an original action in such foreign jurisdictions and that a foreign judgment based upon United
States federal or state securities laws would be enforced in such jurisdictions. Therefore, a final judgment
for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil
liability, whether or not based on United States federal or state securities laws, would not be automatically
enforceable in such countries. You should consult with your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as
needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

The statute of limitations applicable to payment of interest and repayment of principal under New
York law is six years.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ardagh Group S.A.

**_Opinion on the Financial Statements_**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Ardagh
Group S.A. and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Company’’) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement
of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the ‘‘consolidated
financial statements’’). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in
conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board.

_Change in Accounting Principle_

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in
which it accounts for leases in 2019, the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with
customers in 2018 and the manner in which it accounts for financial instruments in 2018.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
due to error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers
Dublin, Ireland

February 20, 2020

We have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1968, which includes periods before the
Company became subject to SEC reporting requirements in 2017. We have not been able to determine the
specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company or its predecessors.
