We believe that our financial statements and the other financial data included and incorporated by reference in this offering

memorandum have been prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) and the regulations published by the SEC and are consistent with current practice, except that certain
financial measures not recognized under GAAP, including earnings before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and
depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) and net debt, are presented. As long as any
of the notes remain outstanding and constitute “restricted securities” under Rule 144, we have agreed to provide, upon request,
all information required by Rule 144A(d)(4).

**NO REVIEW BY SEC**

The information in this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from the registration requirements under

the Securities Act. The information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to, and does not, comply with all of
the disclosure requirements of the SEC that would apply if this offering were being made pursuant to a registration statement
filed with the SEC. Compliance with such requirements could require the modification or exclusion of certain financial
measures, and the presentation of certain other information not included in this offering memorandum or the exclusion of
certain information included herein. There are no SEC registration rights associated with the notes, and we have no intention to
offer to exchange the notes for new notes pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. The indenture governing the
notes has not been and will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

**SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of

Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
These statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to our expectations regarding the performance of our
business, our financial results, our liquidity and capital resources, the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”)
outbreak and other non-historical statements. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of
words such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “projects,”
“predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words.
Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, among others, risks inherent to the
hospitality industry, macroeconomic factors beyond our control, competition for hotel guests and management and franchise
contracts, risks related to doing business with third-party hotel owners, performance of our information technology systems,
growth of reservation channels outside of our system, risks of doing business outside of the United States and our indebtedness.
Additional factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements are
described under “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum and in “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” of HLT Parent’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2020 (the “2019 Annual
Report”) as supplemented in HLT Parent’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 4, 2020 (the “Q3
2020 Quarterly Report”), as such factors may be further updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC (which
documents are incorporated by reference herein), as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other
cautionary statements that are included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. We undertake no obligation
to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise, except as required by law.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

The rules of the SEC regulate the use in filings with the SEC of “non-GAAP financial measures,” such as EBITDA,

Adjusted EBITDA and net debt and certain related ratios, that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in
accordance with GAAP. We have included and incorporated by reference EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and net debt metrics in
this offering memorandum because we believe that they provide investors with additional information to measure our
performance and evaluate our ability to service our debt. Our use of the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and net debt may
vary from the use of such terms by others in our industry and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss),
operating income (loss), revenues, debt presented in accordance with GAAP or any other performance measures derived in
accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or to cash flows as measures of liquidity.

We define EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and

amortization. We evaluate our operating performance using a metric we refer to as “Adjusted EBITDA” which we calculate as
EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses, revenues and expenses in
connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated equity investments; (ii) foreign currency
transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) replacement reserves


-----

required under certain lease agreements; (v) reorganization costs, severance, relocation and other related expenses; (vi) sharebased compensation expense; (vii) non-cash impairment; (viii) amortization of contract acquisition costs; (ix) the net effect of
reimbursable costs included in other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties; and (x) other items.

We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about us and our financial

condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our
management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions and (ii) these measures are
frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare
results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. Additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary
widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. For instance, interest expense and income taxes
are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively,
and, therefore could vary significantly across companies. Depreciation and amortization, as well as amortization of contract
acquisition costs, are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the
useful lives that are used. For Adjusted EBITDA, we also exclude items such as: (i) FF&E replacement reserves for leased
hotels to be consistent with the treatment of FF&E for owned hotels, where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the
FF&E; (ii) share-based compensation expense, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place
and the usage of them; (iii) the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses, as we contractually do
not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts; and (iv) other items, including
reorganization and related severance costs, that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our performance.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net

income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives, either in isolation or as a
substitute, for net income (loss), cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these
limitations are:

   - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;

   - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect income tax expenses or benefits or the cash requirements to pay our
taxes;

   - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital
expenditures or contractual commitments;

   - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we
consider not to be indicative of our future operations;

   - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often
have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements; and

   - other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as
comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to

us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use to evaluate our financial leverage. Net debt is calculated as (i) long
term debt, including current maturities and excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount, and (ii) the
Company’s share of unconsolidated affiliate debt, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs, reduced by (a) cash and cash
equivalents and (b) restricted cash and cash equivalents. Net debt should not be considered as a substitute to debt presented in
accordance with GAAP. Net debt may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe net debt
provides useful information about our indebtedness to investors as it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and
other interested parties to compare the indebtedness of companies.


-----

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, presented herein, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is included as it is frequently

used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to compare the financial condition of companies. Net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA ratio should not be considered as an alternative to measures of financial condition derived in accordance
with GAAP, and it may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies.

The SEC’s rules require, among other things:

   - presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and
presented in accordance with GAAP;

   - a quantitative reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most comparable
financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP;

   - a statement disclosing the reasons why the registrant’s management believes that presentation of the non-GAAP
financial measure provides useful information to investors; and

   - a statement disclosing the additional purposes, if any, for which the registrant’s management uses the non-GAAP
financial measure.

These rules prohibit, among other things:

   - exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent an ability
to settle in another manner from non-GAAP liquidity measures;

   - adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent
or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur; and

   - presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of any financial statement prepared in accordance with
GAAP or pro forma financial information.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum may not comply

with the SEC’s rules and may be changed in or excluded from our future filings with the SEC.

**BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

Except where otherwise indicated, financial information included and incorporated by reference in this offering

memorandum is of HLT Parent and its subsidiaries, including the Issuer and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis. HLT
Parent has no independent operations and has no material assets other than its ownership of 100% of the equity interests in
HWP, which, in turn, owns 100% of the equity interests in the Issuer and consolidates the financial position and results of all of
the operating subsidiaries included in the consolidated historical financial statements of HLT Parent incorporated by reference
in this offering memorandum. As a result, the consolidated financial information included and incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum with respect to HLT Parent is substantially the same as the Issuer’s financial information.

As used in this offering memorandum, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, references to:

   - "Hilton," "the Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to HLT Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the
Issuer;

   - "ADR" or "average daily rate" means hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given
period;

   - "comparable hotels" mean those hotels that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar
year as of the end of the current period, and open January 1st of the previous year; (ii) have not undergone a change in
brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods presented; and (iii) have not sustained substantial
property damage, business interruption, undergone large-scale capital projects or for which comparable results are not
available. When considering business interruption in the context of our definition of comparable hotels, any hotel that
had completely or partially suspended operations on a temporary basis at any point during the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was considered to be part of the definition of comparable
hotels. Despite these temporary suspensions of hotel operations, we believe that including these hotels within
occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room reflects the underlying results of our business for the
nine months ended September 30, 2020;

   - "Existing Senior Notes" refers to our outstanding 2024 Notes, our outstanding 4.625% Senior Notes due 2025 (the
"2025 Notes"), our existing 5.375% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “5.375% 2025 Notes”), our outstanding 5.125%
Senior Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes"), our outstanding 4.875% Senior Notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes"), our
outstanding 5.750% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) and our outstanding 4.875% Senior Notes due 2030
(the “2030 Notes”);

   - "HLT Parent" refers to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation, that is the ultimate parent entity of
the Issuer and will be a parent guarantor of the notes;

   - "HWP" refers to Hilton Worldwide Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, that is the direct parent
company of the Issuer and will be a parent guarantor of the notes;

   - "Issuer" refers to Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc., a Delaware corporation, that is the issuer of the notes
offered hereby;

   - "occupancy" means the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a
hotel or group of hotels for a given period;

   - "RevPAR" or "revenue per available room" means hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights
available to guests for a given period;

   - "RevPAR index" measures a hotel's relative share of its segment's revenue per available room. For example, if a
subject hotel's RevPAR is $50 and the RevPAR of its competitive set is $50, the subject hotel would have no RevPAR
index premium. If the subject hotel's RevPAR totaled $60, its RevPAR index premium would be 20%, which indicates
that the subject hotel has outperformed other hotels in its competitive set; and

   - our "hotels" and "rooms" refer to the hotels and resorts managed, franchised, owned or leased by us. The majority of
our hotels and resorts are owned by third-party owners;

Defined terms in the financial statements have the meanings ascribed to them in the financial statements.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy

and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives in place at various times during the
period, resulting in cancellations and significantly reduced travel around the world. The reduction in travel has resulted in
complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations in many of the locations where our hotels are located for an indeterminate
duration. This disruption to our business largely began in mid-March, and included approximately 20 percent of our global
hotel properties for some portion of the year to date period. As such, the pandemic had a material adverse impact on our results
for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and, based on the potential impact of further restrictions and health and safety
concerns, we expect it to continue to have a material adverse impact on our results in future periods.

As of November 2, 2020, 97 percent of our global hotel properties were open, while approximately 190 hotels had

temporarily suspended operations. However, starting in late October, certain geographic areas have re-imposed additional travel
restrictions, which may result in further adverse impacts to our hotel operations. Hotels that have reopened or remained open
generally have experienced significantly lower occupancy as compared with periods before the onset of the pandemic.

In response to this global crisis, we have taken actions to prioritize the safety and security of our guests, employees and

owners and support our communities. We found alternative uses for certain of our hotel properties, including providing housing
for first responders and healthcare workers, and provided financial assistance to organizations helping those affected by
COVID-19 through our Hilton Effect Foundation. Additionally, we have taken several steps to help our business withstand this
uncertain time, which have included: (i) fully drawing down on our $1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below);
(ii) suspending dividend payments and share repurchases; (iii) implementing strict cost management measures, such as
temporarily halting certain marketing programs, temporarily eliminating non-essential expenses, including capital expenditures,
and reducing payroll and related costs through workforce reductions, furloughs and temporary salary reductions; (iv)
consummating the pre-sale of Hilton Honors points to American Express for $1.0 billion in cash; and (v) issuing $1.0 billion
aggregate principal amount of senior notes in April 2020. After considering our approach to liquidity and accessing our
available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating and
other expenditures and other commitments for the foreseeable future both prior to and giving effect to this offering.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe the following competitive strengths provide the foundation for our position as a leading global hospitality

company.

   - **_World-Class Hospitality Brands. Our globally recognized, world-class brands have defined the hospitality industry._**
Our flagship Hilton Hotels & Resorts brand often serves as an introduction to our wider range of brands, including
those in the luxury segment, midscale segment and everything in between, that are designed to accommodate any
customer's needs anywhere in the world. Our brands have achieved an average global RevPAR index premium of 15%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, based on STR data. This means that our brands achieve on average
15% more revenue per room than competitive properties in similar markets. The demonstrated strength of our brands
makes us a preferred partner for hotel owners.

   - **_Leading Global Presence and Scale. We are one of the largest hospitality companies in the world with 6,333_**
properties and 998,282 rooms in 118 countries and territories as of September 30, 2020. We have hotels in key urban
destinations throughout our key operating regions and 641 hotels located at or near airports around the world. Our
global presence allows us to serve our loyal customers throughout the world and to introduce our award-winning
brands to customers in new markets. These world-class brands facilitate system growth by providing hotel owners with
a variety of options to address each market's specific needs. In addition, the diversity of our operations reduces our
exposure to business cycles, individual market disruptions and other risks. Our robust commercial services platform
allows us to take advantage of our scale to more effectively deliver products and services that drive customer
preference and enhance commercial performance on a global basis.

   - **_Large and Growing Loyal Customer Base. Serving our customers is our first priority. We seek to continually adapt to_**
customer preferences and provide our customers with superior experiences. We have earned 43 first place awards in
the J.D. Power North America Guest Satisfaction rankings since 1999. Hilton Honors unites all our brands, encourages
customer loyalty and allows us to provide tailored promotions, messaging and customer experiences. Membership in
our Hilton Honors program continues to increase, and, as of September 30, 2020, there were 110 million Hilton
Honors members.

   - **_Aligned Culture and Organization. As an organization of people serving people, it is imperative that we manage our_**
talent to effectively serve our various stakeholders. Our purpose-led, performance-driven culture begins with an
intense alignment around our mission, vision, values and key strategic priorities. Our President and Chief Executive
Officer, Christopher J. Nassetta, has 32 years of experience in the hotel industry, leading Hilton for 13 years and
previously serving as President and Chief Executive Officer of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. He and the balance of our
executive management team have been instrumental in transforming our organization and building a culture that
attracts, develops and retains leaders at all levels of the organization who are focused on delivering exceptional service
to our customers every day. We rely on our more than 149,000 employees to execute our strategy and continue to
enhance our products and services to ensure that we remain at the forefront of performance and innovation in the
lodging industry.

**Our Business and Growth Strategy**

The following are key elements of our strategy to become the preeminent global hospitality company—the first choice of

guests, employees and owners alike:

   - **_Expand our Global Network. We intend to build on our leading position in the U.S. and expand our global footprint._**
We had approximately 18% of the market share of rooms under construction as of September 30, 2020, based on STR
data. We aim to increase the relative contribution of our international operations by increasing the number of rooms in
our system that are located outside of the U.S., and as of September 30, 2020, over half of our rooms in our
development pipeline are located outside of the U.S. We plan to continue to expand our global footprint by introducing
the right brands with the right product positioning in targeted markets and allocating business development resources
effectively to drive high-quality new unit growth in every region of the world.

_•_ **_Grow our Fee-Based Businesses._** We intend to grow our higher margin, fee-based businesses by developing new
third-party hotels and converting existing hotels to our brands. Our development pipeline consisted of over 408,000
rooms as of September 30, 2020. Upon completion, this pipeline of new, third-party owned hotels would result in a
42% increase in our managed and franchised hotel room count with minimal capital investment from us. We are


-----

focused on delivering a streamlined process to allow new hotels to open under our brands and hotels converting to our
brands to do so effectively. In addition, we have historically been able to increase the average effective franchise fees
we receive due to the strength of our brands.

_•_ **_Strengthen and Enhance our Customer Relationships and Loyalty._** We intend to enhance our customer experience in
all of our service offerings by delivering distinctive, high quality, consistent brand management and continuing to
develop flexible products and services that drive customer preference and increased RevPAR premiums. We will
continue to innovate in the delivery of modern products and service standards that are relevant and meet evolving
customer needs. We believe providing distinctive customer experiences will deliver financial results that support
incremental owner investment in our hotels. We also focus on providing products and services that drive opportunities
for growth in the U.S. and tailoring our products as appropriate to meet the needs of customers and developers outside
the U.S. We will continue to enhance our commercial services platform to ensure we have a formidable sales, pricing,
marketing and distribution platform to drive premium commercial performance to our entire system of hotels. We also
will continue to invest in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program to ensure it remains relevant to our customers and
drives customer loyalty and value to our hotel owners.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken actions to prioritize the safety and security of our guests,
employees and owners and support our communities, including launching Hilton CleanStay to deliver a new standard
of cleanliness and disinfection to our properties worldwide and Hilton EventReady, which focuses on cleanliness and
customer service specific to meetings and events. We have also launched WorkSpaces by Hilton to expand the use of
guestrooms to be used as socially distant places to work with daily, flexible offerings. We believe that providing
elevated cleanliness and safety and alternate uses for our spaces will enhance customer loyalty and maximize
performance in current market conditions.

**Our Structure**

The following diagram illustrates our simplified organizational structure after giving effect to this offering and the

application of the proceeds received therefrom. This diagram is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not show all
legal entities or obligations of such entities:

____________

(1) Each of HLT Parent and HWP is a guarantor of indebtedness under the Issuer's senior secured credit facilities ("Senior
Secured Credit Facilities") and the Existing Senior Notes and will be a guarantor of the notes offered hereby. Neither HLT
Parent nor HWP is subject to the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement (other than a passive holdings covenant) and
indentures governing such indebtedness.

(2) On February 29, 2020, we merged Hilton Worldwide Finance LLC (“HWF”), the original issuer of the 2025 Notes and the
2027 Notes and the original borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, with and into the Issuer with the Issuer
continuing as the surviving entity. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are comprised of: (i) a $1.75 billion senior secured
revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and (ii) a $2,619 million senior secured term loan facility due
2026 (the “Term Loan”). In March 2020, as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve
financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we fully drew
down on our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2020, in addition to our outstanding debt balance of $1.69
billion under our Revolving Credit Facility, we also had $60 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Facility. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Credit Facilities.”

(3) For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented $462 million, or 38%, of our
total revenues, excluding other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and $(54) million of our Adjusted
EBITDA, driven by losses in our ownership segment.

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio as of September 30, 2020 is calculated as net debt as of that date divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve
months ended September 30, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2020 is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the
nine months ended September 30, 2020 plus Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 less Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio as of September 30, 2019 is calculated as net debt as of that date divided by Adjusted EBITDA
for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2019 is calculated as
Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 plus Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 less Adjusted EBITDA
for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to long-term debt, including current maturities, which we believe is the most closely comparable
GAAP financial measure, on an actual and as adjusted basis to give effect to this offering and related use of proceeds:

**September 30, 2020** **As of September 30,** **As of December 31,**

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to purchase the notes, you should_

_carefully consider the risks described below and incorporated by reference herein (including, without limitation, the specific_
_risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in HLT Parent’s 2019 Annual Report, as supplemented by those risks_
_described in HLT Parent’s Q3 2020 Quarterly Report), all of the information contained in this offering memorandum and_
_incorporated by reference herein, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, which are_
_incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. Any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our_
_business, results of operations and financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and_
_uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial_
_may also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In such a case, you may_
_lose all or part of your original investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual_
_results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding_
_Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect our business,_**

**_financial condition and results of operations._**

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel

restrictions and stay-at-home directives that have resulted in cancellations and reduced travel around the world, as well as
complete and partial suspensions of certain hotel operations for an indeterminate duration. Currently, there are no fully effective
vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 and the timing and efficacy of any future vaccines and treatments are uncertain. As such,
the COVID-19 pandemic has had a material negative impact on our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and
will continue to negatively affect future results. The current and uncertain future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including
its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel and use our hotel properties for lodging, food and beverage and other
services, is expected to continue to negatively affect our results, operations, outlook, plans, growth, cash flows and liquidity.

During the pandemic, the U.S. and other national and local governments have imposed travel restrictions at various times

and, in some countries and U.S. states, re-imposed such restrictions, and a number of our hotels have fully or partially
suspended operations. We have been and expect to continue to be negatively affected by additional governmental regulations
and travel advisories to fight the pandemic, including recommendations by the U.S. Department of State, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. In recent weeks, a number of national, state and local
governments have imposed restrictions that could further adversely affect our results.

We cannot predict when any of our hotels that have completely or partially suspended operations will be able to fully

reopen, the conditions upon which a full reopening may occur or the effects of any such conditions. We also cannot predict if
any of our hotels that are currently operational will have to completely or partially suspend operations in the future. Moreover,
even where travel advisories and restrictions have been lifted, travel demand has been and is likely to remain weak for a
significant length of time and we cannot predict if or when our properties will return to pre-pandemic demand or pricing.
Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels
and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, will negatively affect travel demand.

The steps we have taken to reduce operating costs, including temporarily reducing compensation, reducing our workforce

and furloughing a substantial number of our employees, and further steps we may take in the future to reduce costs for us or our
third-party hotel owners, may negatively affect our brand reputation and ability to attract and retain employees. If our
furloughed employees do not return to work with us when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, including because they find new
jobs during the furlough, we may face operational challenges that could negatively affect hotel results, guest experience and
loyalty. We also may face demands or requests from labor unions that represent employees at our hotels for additional
compensation, healthcare benefits or other terms, including making payments to underfunded multi-employer pension plans for
covered union employees, as a result of the pandemic that could increase costs, and we could experience labor issues as we
implement our mitigation plans. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we could still experience long-term impacts on
our operating costs as a result of attempts to counteract future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other viruses through, for example,
enhanced health and hygiene requirements or other such measures in one or more regions.

We cannot predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our partners, such as third-party owners of our

properties, third-party service providers, travel agencies, suppliers and other vendors. In particular, if third-party owners of our


-----

hotels are unable to maintain their hotels and service indebtedness secured by their hotels, our results of operations and
reputation could suffer. Third-party owners of our hotels have experienced financing difficulties and significant declines in
revenues, thereby making it more likely that they could declare bankruptcy or face other difficulties with their lenders.
Bankruptcies, sales or foreclosures involving our hotels could, in some cases, result in the termination of our management or
franchise contracts and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows, which would negatively affect our results of
operations. Hotel owners with financial difficulties have been and may continue to be unable or unwilling to pay us amounts
that we are entitled to under our existing contracts on a timely basis or at all. Current and ongoing economic conditions also
could affect our ability to enter into management and franchise contracts with potential third-party owners of our hotels, who
may be unable to obtain financing or face other delays in developing hotel projects. As a result, some properties in our
development pipeline may not enter our system when we anticipated, or at all, and new hotels may enter our pipeline at a
slower rate than in the past, thereby negatively affecting our overall growth. Likewise, if we or our hotel owners or franchisees
are unable to access capital to make physical improvements to our hotels, the quality of our hotels may suffer, which may
negatively impact our reputation and guest loyalty, and our market share may suffer as a result.

We may be required to raise additional capital in the future, and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among

other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of
financing, our prospects and our credit ratings. Certain of our credit ratings have been downgraded or placed on credit watch,
and if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating
levels, our industry or us, our access to capital and the cost of any debt financing would be negatively affected. In addition, the
terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, or require incremental collateral, which may further
restrict our business operations. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations,
or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. In addition, because of reduced travel demand, certain
of our leased properties will not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses. If or when we determine the value of
our leased properties has significantly declined, we have recognized and in the future could have to recognize significant noncash impairment charges to our results of operations. Further, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spending
patterns of Hilton Honors co-branded credit cardholders and the acquisition of new cardholders, we have received and expect to
continue to receive lower license fees under our co-branded credit card arrangements.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and could cause a global

recession, which would have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations. The significant increase in
unemployment in the U.S. and other regions due to the adoption of social distancing and other policies to slow the spread of
COVID-19 continues to have a sustained negative impact on travel demand. The extent of the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on our business and the travel industry at large remains highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future
developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak, the timing and availability of vaccinations
and other treatments to combat COVID-19, and the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to stabilize and normal
economic and operating conditions to resume. Given the uncertainty as to the extent and timing of the potential future spread or
mitigation of COVID-19 and the imposition or relaxation of protective measures, we are presently unable to estimate the full
impact to our future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our internal controls over financial reporting as we have

reduced our workforce and placed many of our employees on temporary furlough. Our remaining employees have been
required to work from home and, therefore, new processes, procedures and controls could be required to respond to changes in
our business environment. Further, should any key employees become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work, the attention of
our management team could be diverted.

The potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could intensify or otherwise affect many of our other risk factors that

are included in "Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors" of HLT Parent’s 2019 Annual Report, including, but not limited to, risks
inherent to the hospitality industry, macroeconomic factors beyond our control, competition for hotel guests and management
and franchise contracts, risks related to doing business with third-party hotel owners, performance of our information
technology systems, growth of reservation channels outside of our system, risks of doing business outside of the U.S. and risks
related to our indebtedness. Because the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the other potential
impacts to our risk factors that are further described in HLT Parent’s 2019 Annual Report are uncertain.

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our_**

**_obligations under the notes._**

We currently have and, after giving effect to, this offering and related use of proceeds, we will continue to have a

substantial amount of debt, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As of September 30, 2020, after giving
effect to this offering and related use of proceeds, we would have had approximately $10.6 billion of total debt outstanding,
excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount. Subject to the limits contained in the indentures that govern the
Existing Senior Notes, the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby and the applicable agreements governing our
other debt and our restricted subsidiaries, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance
working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our
high level of debt could increase. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences to the holders of the
notes, including the following:

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and our other debt;

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or
other general corporate requirements;

   - requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes,
thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
general corporate purposes;

   - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

   - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;

   - placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and

   - increasing our cost of borrowing.

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other_**

**_transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above._**

We may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indentures that govern the Existing

Senior Notes and the notes offered hereby and the applicable agreements governing certain of our other debt and the debt of our
restricted subsidiaries contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other
transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations,
such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent new debt is
added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor would
increase.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations_**

**_to increase significantly._**

Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or other variable

rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. Both as of September 30, 2020 and after giving effect to this
offering and related use of proceeds, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount and the effects of any interest
rate swaps, we had or would have had approximately $4,309 million of variable rate indebtedness, or 41% of our outstanding
debt. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the
amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.


-----

In addition, certain of our variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest and

may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other
regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new
benchmark or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but
could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.

**_We may be unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on and is

subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial,
competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international banking
and capital markets. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, to refinance our
debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, including our existing stock repurchase program and our expected dividends.
Substantially all of our other debt, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Senior Notes, will mature
before the maturity date of the notes.

If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or

refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair
our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our
financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to
comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations.

Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could elect to declare all the funds

borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. The lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility
could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans, and institute foreclosure proceedings
against their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we breach our covenants under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, we would be in default thereunder. The lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we
could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby and certain of our other debt agreements and the debt_**

**_agreements of our restricted subsidiaries impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, which may prevent us_**
**_from capitalizing on business opportunities._**

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby and certain of our other debt agreements and the debt agreements of

restricted subsidiaries impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit the Issuer’s
ability and the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

   - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

   - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

   - make certain investments;

   - incur certain liens;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - merge or consolidate;

   - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us;

   - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

   - transfer or sell assets.

In addition, the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contains a financial maintenance

covenant that requires the Issuer to maintain a consolidated secured net leverage ratio not to exceed 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last


-----

day of any period of four consecutive quarters. The Term Loan does not have the benefit of the financial maintenance covenant
(including, without limitation, any rights as to amendments, modifications and waivers with respect thereto).

As a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise

additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any
future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the
lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our existing indebtedness

and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived,
could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these
borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could
be adversely affected.

**_Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events_**

**_beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations_**
**_and our financial condition._**

If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the

defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot
assure you that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if
accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our
secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of
default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our
other debt instruments.

**_Repayment of our debt, including required principal and interest payments on the notes, is dependent on cash flow_**

**_generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our control._**

Our subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations. Accordingly,

repayment of our indebtedness, including the notes, is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our
subsidiaries and (if they are not guarantors of the notes) their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt
repayment or otherwise.

Unless they are guarantors of the notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or to

make funds available to us for that purpose. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to,
make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the notes. Each non-guarantor
subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to
obtain cash from our non-guarantor subsidiaries. While limitations on our subsidiaries restrict their ability to pay dividends or
make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.

In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and

interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

**_Because the guarantee of the notes by HLT Parent is being provided solely for the purpose of allowing the Issuer to_**

**_satisfy its reporting obligations under the indenture governing the notes, you should not assign any value to the guarantee of_**
**_the notes by HLT Parent._**

The guarantee of the notes by HLT Parent is being provided solely for the purpose of allowing the Issuer to satisfy its

reporting obligations under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby by furnishing financial information relating
to HLT Parent instead of consolidated financial information of the Issuer and, accordingly, you should not assign any value to
the guarantee by HLT Parent. Moreover, the covenants in the indentures governing the Existing Senior Notes and the notes
offered hereby apply only to the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries and do not apply to HLT Parent or HWP.


-----

**_Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that_**

**_will not guarantee the notes._**

The notes will not be guaranteed by certain of the Issuer’s existing and future subsidiaries. Only the Issuer’s existing

wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
Existing Senior Notes will initially guarantee the notes. None of the Issuer’s foreign subsidiaries, non-wholly owned domestic
subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries, or unrestricted subsidiaries will guarantee the notes, and no foreign subsidiaries are
expected to guarantee the notes in the future. Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of
creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and will not be satisfied from the assets of these nonguarantor subsidiaries until their creditors are paid in full.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented $1,871 million or 50% of our total

revenues, excluding other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and $559 million or 24% of our Adjusted
EBITDA, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented $462 million or 38%
of our total revenues, excluding other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and $(54) million of our Adjusted
EBITDA, driven by losses in our ownership segment.

In addition, the guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be released in connection with a transfer of such subsidiary

guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture governing the notes or upon certain other events described in
“Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit these subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt and

will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered indebtedness under the indentures.

**_Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees,_**

**_subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments_**
**_received from us._**

Under federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the notes and the guarantees

could be voided, or claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees could be subordinated to all of our other debt, if the issuance
of the notes, a guarantee or a grant of security was found to have been made for less than reasonable equivalent value and we, at
the time we incurred the indebtedness evidenced by the notes:

   - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such indebtedness;

   - were engaged in, or about to engage in, a business or transaction for which our remaining assets constituted
unreasonably small capital; or

   - intended to incur, or believed that we would incur, debts beyond our ability to repay such debts as they mature.

A court might also void the issuance of the notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors, if the court found that

we issued the notes or the guarantors entered into the guaranty agreements with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud our or
their respective creditors.

A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the

notes or the guarantees if we or a guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. If a
court were to void the issuance of the notes or the guarantees, you would no longer have a claim against us or the guarantors.
Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In
addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the guarantors or, with respect to
the notes, any guarantee.

In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes made at a time when we were subsequently found to be insolvent

could be voided and required to be returned to us or to a fund for the benefit of our creditors if such payment is made to an
insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would
give the creditors more than such creditors would have received in a liquidation under Title 11 of the United States Code, as
amended (the “Bankruptcy Code”).


-----

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent and preferential transfer laws will vary depending upon the

law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent or preferential transfer has occurred. Generally, however, we
would be considered insolvent if:

   - the sum of our debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair saleable value of all our assets;

   - the present fair saleable value of our assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay our probable
liability on existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or

   - we could not pay our debts as they become due.

After giving effect to the indebtedness incurred in this offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we believe

we will not be insolvent, will not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which we are engaged and will not have
incurred debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they mature. There can be no assurance, however, as to what standard a
court would apply in making such determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard. The indenture
that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its
guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a
fraudulent transfer. We cannot assure you that this limitation will protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges
or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in
full when due. Furthermore, in Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc. v Citicorp North America, Inc.
(“TOUSA”), the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings
clause that will be included in the indenture governing the notes was unenforceable. As a result, the subsidiary guarantees were
found to be fraudulent conveyances. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the liability findings
of the Bankruptcy Court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally. If the TOUSA decision were
followed by other courts, the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly
increased.

In addition, although each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum

amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this
provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that
guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against

us under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holders of the notes engaged in some type
of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage
upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain_**

**_circumstances, holders of notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

Holders of notes have the benefit of the guarantees of the guarantors. However, the guarantees by the guarantors are limited

to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a guarantor’s liability
under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Further, under
the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could
void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. See “—Federal and
state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect
of the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us.” In addition, you will
lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of the Notes
—Guarantees.”

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer required by the indenture._**

Upon a change of control triggering event, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, you

will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the notes of each series then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of
the principal amount of the notes of such series, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the
purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the notes. We cannot assure you that we
would be able to refinance the notes on reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes of the
applicable series or to purchase all validly tendered notes of such series would be an event of default under the indenture with


-----

respect to such series of notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt, including debt under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Senior Notes. Our future debt also may contain restrictions on repayment
requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture.

**_We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged transactions that do_**

**_not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the notes._**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture that will govern the

notes offered hereby, constitute a “change of control” triggering event that would require us to repurchase the notes,
notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect
our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which would not constitute a change of control
under the indenture governing the notes, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or
otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

**_Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control triggering event giving rise to their right to_**

**_have the notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of change of control in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby includes a phrase relating to

the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all”
under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of
less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders
—Change of Control Triggering Event.”

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the notes under_**

**_applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable

state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the notes. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require
us to register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a
transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be
required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions.”

**_An active trading market may not develop for the notes._**

We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for either series of notes. We do not intend to apply for

listing of the notes on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system in the United States. Although we
have been informed by the initial purchasers that they currently intend to make a market for each series of notes they are not
obliged to do so and any market making may be discontinued at any time without notice.

The liquidity of, and trading market for, each series of notes may also be adversely affected by, among other things:

   - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the notes of such series;

   - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

   - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

   - the number of holders of the notes of such series;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes of such series;

   - the conditions of the financial markets; and

   - prevailing interest rates.

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in

the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the notes of each series.


-----

We are offering these notes in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state

securities laws. Therefore, the notes may be transferred or resold only in a transaction exempt from the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities that are similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if any,
for the notes of each series will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices
at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their
initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance, and other factors.

**_A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may adversely affect the_**

**_market price or liquidity of the notes._**

The notes offered hereby will have a non-investment grade rating. There can be no assurances that such rating will remain for
any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating
agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. For example, in
March 2020, Moody’s placed our credit ratings on review for downgrade, and in April 2020, S&P downgraded our credit rating
and assigned a negative outlook, and such agencies could take additional negative actions with respect to the ratings assigned to
our debt securities in the future. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the notes, and may be revised
or withdrawn at any time. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect of risks relating to the structure or
marketing of the notes. If the credit rating of either series of the notes is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you
may not be able to resell your notes without a substantial discount.

**_If the notes are rated investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P, certain covenants contained in the indenture will be_**

**_terminated, and holders of the notes will lose the protection of these covenants even if the notes subsequently fall back below_**
**_investment grade._**

The indenture contains certain covenants that will be terminated for a series of notes if such series of notes is rated

investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P. These covenants restrict the Issuer’s ability and the ability of its restricted
subsidiaries to, among other things:

   - incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;

   - make distributions or other restricted payments;

   - sell capital stock or other assets; and

   - engage in transactions with affiliates.

Because these restrictions will not apply with respect to the applicable series of notes once the notes of such series are rated

investment grade, we will be able to incur additional debt and consummate transactions that may impair our ability to satisfy
our obligations with respect to the notes.

**_The notes are unsecured and effectively junior to our secured indebtedness, including borrowings under the Senior_**

**_Secured Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness._**

Our obligations under the notes and guarantees will be unsecured and will be effectively junior to the Issuer’s and the

guarantors’ secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. Borrowings
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the guarantees thereof will be secured by substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and any existing and future subsidiary guarantors, including all of the capital stock of the Issuer and each restricted
subsidiary (which, in the case of foreign subsidiaries, is limited to 65% of the capital stock of each first-tier foreign subsidiary).

The notes are effectively subordinated to all such secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of that collateral. If an

event of default occurs under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will have a
prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of the holders of the notes, even if we are in default with respect to the notes. In that
event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them (including all
amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to
satisfy the claims of the holders of the notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or
payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy proceeding,
holders of the notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all holders of our unsecured


-----

indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as such notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based
upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there
will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, holders of such notes may receive less, ratably, than
holders of secured indebtedness.

As of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering and the related use of proceeds, we would have had

approximately $4,577 million of secured indebtedness outstanding, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and
discount. The notes and the related guarantees would have ranked effectively junior to such outstanding indebtedness. The
indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness, which could be substantial.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $985 million, after deducting the initial

purchasers’ discount and our estimated expenses relating to the offering (which are estimated to be approximately $15 million).
We intend to use the proceeds of this offering, together with available cash, to redeem all of our 2024 Notes, of which $1.0
billion aggregate principal amount were outstanding as of September 30, 2020, and to pay the related redemption premium and
all fees and expenses related thereto, and to use any remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes.

The 2024 Notes are currently redeemable at a price of 101.063%. Unless earlier redeemed or repaid, our 2024 Notes will

mature in accordance with their terms on September 1, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 4.250% per annum. The redemption of
our 2024 Notes is conditioned on the consummation of this offering of notes. This offering memorandum does not constitute an
offer to redeem or repurchase the 2024 Notes. Any redemption of our 2024 Notes will be made by a notice of redemption in
accordance with the terms of indenture governing the 2024 Notes. The offering of the notes is not conditioned upon the
consummation of the redemption of the 2024 Notes.

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be holders of our outstanding 2024 Notes, and as such

may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering in connection with the redemption of such notes. See “Plan of
Distribution.”

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following is a description of the principal indebtedness that we have as of the date of this offering memorandum.

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

On October 25, 2013, HWF entered into a credit agreement, as amended on August 18, 2016, November 21, 2016,

March 16, 2017, April 19, 2018, June 5, 2019 and June 21, 2019, with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative
agent, collateral agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer and the other agents and lenders from time to time party thereto.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities consist of:

   - the Term Loan, which matures on June 21, 2026, of which $2.6 billion remains drawn and outstanding thereunder as
of the date of this offering memorandum; and

   - the $1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility, $250 million of which is available in the form of letters of credit, which
matures on June 5, 2024, of which the entire amount (including $60 million in letters of credit) is outstanding
thereunder as of the date of this offering memorandum.

On February 29, 2020, HWF merged with and into the Issuer, with the Issuer continuing as the surviving entity and the

Issuer becoming the successor borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Issuer is referred to throughout this
section as the “Borrower.” The Revolving Credit Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for
short-term borrowings referred to as swing line borrowings. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide the
Borrower with the option to raise incremental credit facilities (including an uncommitted incremental facility that provides the
Borrower the option to increase the amount available under the Term Loan and/or the Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate
of up to $1.5 billion, subject to additional increases upon satisfaction of a first lien net leverage-based test), refinance the loans
with debt incurred outside the credit agreement and extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term
Loan, subject to certain limitations.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest, at the Borrower's option, at a per annum rate equal to a margin over either

(a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the administrative agent's prime lending rate, (2) the federal funds
effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a LIBOR rate determined
by reference to the Reuters LIBOR rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing. The margin for the Term Loan is
0.75%, in the case of base rate loans, and 1.75%, in the case of LIBOR rate loans. The Term Loan is subject to a LIBOR floor
of 0.00%. The weighted average interest rate payable on the Term Loan as of September 30, 2020 was equal to 1.90%.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the Borrower's option, at a per annum rate equal to a

margin over either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the administrative agent's prime lending rate,
(2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a
LIBOR rate determined by reference to the Reuters LIBOR rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing. The margin
for the Revolving Credit Facility is 0.00%, in the case of base rate loans, and 1.00%, in the case of LIBOR rate loans when first
lien net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00, subject to a step-up of 0.25% in the event the first lien net leverage
ratio exceeds 1.00 to 1.00 but is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00, subject to an additional step-up of 0.25% in the event the first
lien net leverage ratio exceeds 2.00 to 1.00 but is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 and subject to an additional step-up of 0.25%
in the event the first lien net leverage ratio exceeds 3.00 to 1.00. The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a LIBOR floor of
0.00%.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Borrower is required

to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments
thereunder. The commitment fee rate is 0.125% per annum. The Borrower is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees.


-----

**_Prepayments_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities require us to prepay outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan, subject to certain

exceptions, with:

   - 50% (which percentage is reduced to 25% upon a first lien net leverage ratio not exceeding 4.60 to 1.00 and 0% upon a
first lien net leverage ratio not exceeding 3.85 to 1.00, as applicable) of annual excess cash flow, calculated in
accordance with the credit agreement;

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds (including insurance and condemnation proceeds) of all non-ordinary course asset sales
or other dispositions of property by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries, subject to de minimis thresholds, if
those net cash proceeds are not reinvested in assets to be used in the Borrower's business or to make certain other
permitted investments (a) within 12 months of the receipt of such net cash proceeds or (b) if the Borrower commits to
reinvest such net cash proceeds within 12 months of the receipt thereof, within 180 days of the date of such
commitment (although in connection with any such prepayment, the Borrower may also repay other first lien debt to
the extent it is so required); and

   - 100% of the net proceeds of any incurrence of debt by the Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than
debt permitted to be incurred or issued under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each lender of the Term Loan has the right to reject its pro rata share of mandatory

prepayments described above, in which case we may retain the amounts so rejected.

The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied pro rata to installments of the Term Loan in direct order of maturity.

**_Amortization_**

The Borrower is required to repay the Term Loan on the last business day of each quarter in installments in an aggregate

principal amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan, with the remaining amount payable on the
maturity date with respect to the Term Loan. Based on the prepayments made to date, we are no longer subject to such
amortization requirements in respect of the Term Loan.

**_Guarantees_**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by each of HLT

Parent, HWP, Hilton Worldwide Finance Corp. (“HWF Corp.”), any subsidiary of HWP that directly or indirectly owns 100%
of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the Borrower, and, subject to certain exceptions, each of the Borrower's
existing and future material restricted domestic wholly owned subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors"). In addition, the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities are collateralized by first priority or equivalent security interests in (i) all the capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, the Borrower and each of the Borrower's and Subsidiary Guarantors' material direct or indirect wholly
owned restricted domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each of the Borrower's or
any Subsidiary Guarantors' direct wholly owned first-tier restricted foreign subsidiaries, and (ii) certain tangible and intangible
assets of HWP, the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications).

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of significant affirmative and negative covenants and customary

events of default. Such covenants, among other things, limit or restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Borrower
and its restricted subsidiaries to:

   - incur additional indebtedness, make guarantees and enter into hedging arrangements;

   - create liens on assets;

   - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

   - engage in mergers or consolidations;


-----

sell assets;

   - make fundamental changes;

   - pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;

   - make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions;

   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

   - make changes in the nature of their business; and

   - make prepayments of subordinated debt.

In addition, the credit agreement requires the Borrower to maintain a financial maintenance covenant of a consolidated

secured net leverage ratio not to exceed 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters. The Term
Loan does not have the benefit of the financial maintenance covenant (including, without limitation, any rights as to
amendments, modifications and waivers with respect thereto).

On April 10, 2018, (i) the loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities had a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the

equivalent) according to Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) according to S&P and (ii) no default had occurred or was
continuing at the time such rating was given. Upon the achievement of such ratings on the loans under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the restrictions in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities regarding incurring additional indebtedness, dividends
and distributions or repurchases of capital stock and transactions with affiliates (collectively, the “Terminated Covenants”) no
longer apply to the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries and will not apply for the duration of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities; provided that covenants that are not Terminated Covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall be
interpreted as though the Terminated Covenants continue to be applicable.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants

and events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are entitled to take
various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and all actions permitted
to be taken by a secured creditor.

**4.250% Senior Notes due 2024**

On August 18, 2016, Hilton Escrow Issuer LLC and Hilton Escrow Issuer Corp. (the "Escrow Issuers"), then indirect

subsidiaries of HLT Parent, issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes under an indenture dated as of
August 18, 2016. On September 22, 2016, the Escrow Issuers merged with and into the Issuer with the Issuer continuing as the
surviving entity. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each
year. The 2024 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by HLT Parent, HWP and each of the Issuer's wholly owned
domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

The Issuer may redeem some or all of the 2024 Notes at a redemption price of 101.063% of the principal amount of 2024

Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price decreases to
100.000% of the principal amount of 2024 Notes to be redeemed on September 1, 2021.

The indenture governing the 2024 Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Issuer's ability and the

ability of its restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, to:

   - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or certain preferred stock;

   - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

   - make certain investments;

   - incur certain liens;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;


-----

merge or consolidate;

   - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the
issuer;

   - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

   - transfer or sell certain assets.

The indenture governing the 2024 Notes contains change of control triggering event provisions and certain customary

affirmative covenants and events of default.

Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture governing 2024 Notes permits the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur

additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of the 2024 Notes, of which

$1.0 billion aggregate principal amount were outstanding as of September 30, 2020, and to pay the related redemption premium
and all fees and expenses related thereto. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**4.625% Senior Notes due 2025**

On March 16, 2017, HWF and HWF Corp. issued $900 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes under an

indenture dated as of March 16, 2017 (the “2025 and 2027 Notes Indenture”). On February 29, 2020, HWF merged with and
into the Issuer, with the Issuer continuing as the surviving entity, and the Issuer assumed all of the obligations of HWF under
the 2025 Notes and the 2025 and 2027 Notes Indenture and HWF Corp. assumed all of the obligations of a guarantor and
became a guarantor under the 2025 Notes and the 2025 and 2027 Notes Indenture. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semiannually in cash in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2025 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis
by HLT Parent, HWP and each of the Issuer’s wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under
our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

We may redeem some or all of the 2025 Notes at a redemption price of 102.312% of the principal amount of 2025 Notes to

be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price decreases to 101.156% and
100.000% of the principal amount of 2025 Notes to be redeemed on April 1, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

The indenture governing the 2025 Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Issuer’s' ability and the

ability of its restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, to:

   - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or certain preferred stock;

   - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

   - make certain investments;

   - incur certain liens;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - merge or consolidate;

   - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the
issuers;

   - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

   - transfer or sell certain assets.

The indenture governing the 2025 Notes contains change of control triggering event provisions and certain customary

affirmative covenants and events of default.

Affiliates (2) the term "HWP" refers to Hilton Worldwide Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the direct parent

below. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, and not this description, will define your rights as Holders of the Notes.
You may request a copy of the Indenture at our address set forth under "Available Information and Incorporation by
Reference."

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The Notes:

   - will be general, unsecured, senior obligations of the Issuer;

   - will rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer;

   - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer, to the extent of the value
of the collateral securing such Secured Indebtedness, including Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities;

   - will be senior in right of payment to any future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes; and

   - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other
liabilities of the Issuer's Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

The Notes will not be subject to registration with the SEC.

**Guarantees**

The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally guarantee, fully and

unconditionally, on an unsecured senior basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity,
by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal
of, premium, if any, interest on the Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by
executing the Indenture or a supplemental indenture.


-----

The Guarantors will guarantee the Notes and, in the future, subject to exceptions set forth under the caption Certain

Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries," each direct and indirect U.S. Wholly
Owned Subsidiary that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Guarantor will, guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and to release as provided below or elsewhere in this
"Description of the Notes." As of the Issue Date, none of our Foreign Subsidiaries, our non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are
Restricted Subsidiaries, our U.S. Wholly Owned Subsidiaries, substantially all of the assets of which consist of the Equity
Interests and/or Indebtedness of one or more Foreign Subsidiaries that are "controlled foreign corporations" within the meaning
of Section 957 of the Code, or our U.S. Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly owned by Foreign
Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and no such Subsidiaries are expected to guarantee the Notes in the future.

Each of the Guarantees:

   - will be a general, unsecured, senior obligation of each Guarantor;

   - will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor;

   - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured to the
extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured Indebtedness, including its guarantee of Indebtedness under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities;

   - will be senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Guarantee of that Guarantor; and

   - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other
liabilities of Subsidiaries of each Guarantor that do not Guarantee the Notes.

As of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Issuer and the

Guarantors would have had approximately $10.3 billion of total debt outstanding, including approximately $4,345 million of
secured indebtedness outstanding, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount.

Only HLT Parent, HWP and the Issuer's U.S. Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries that guarantee

certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor will guarantee the Notes. None of the Issuer’s Foreign Subsidiaries or nonwholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are or will be required to guarantee the Notes. None of the Issuer's U.S. Wholly
Owned Subsidiaries substantially all of the assets of which consist of the Equity Interests and/or Indebtedness of one or more
Foreign Subsidiaries that are "controlled foreign corporations" within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code, and none of the
Issuer's U.S. Wholly Owned Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owned by Foreign Subsidiaries, are or will be required to
guarantee the Notes. As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. Under certain
circumstances, the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its existing and future subsidiaries as "Unrestricted
Subsidiaries." Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
guarantee the Notes.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented $1,871 million or 50% of our total

revenues, excluding other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and $559 million or 24% of our Adjusted
EBITDA, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented $462 million or 38%
of our total revenues, excluding other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and $(54) million of our Adjusted
EBITDA, driven by losses in our ownership segment. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar
proceeding of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and
their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the
existing and future liabilities of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally
senior to the Notes. The Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness which may be
incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from

constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a
Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor's obligation to an amount
that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all
other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of
such indebtedness, a Guarantor's liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our


-----

Indebtedness and the Notes Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the notes and

the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return
payments received from us."

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed

obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor's pro
rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in
accordance with GAAP.

Each Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all its assets

to the Issuer or another Guarantor without limitation or any other Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in the
Indenture. See "—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets."

Each Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Notes will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and

unconditionally released and discharged with respect to such series upon:

(1) (a) any sale, exchange, disposition or transfer (by merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or

otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor, after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor, in each case if such sale, exchange, disposition or
transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(b) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of Indebtedness under the Senior

Secured Credit Facilities, or the release or discharge of such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such
Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee (it being understood that a
release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any
such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be
required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries");

(c) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance

with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

the Indenture; and

(2) such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate of such Guarantor or the Issuer and an Opinion of

Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction or release and
discharge have been complied with. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither an Officer's Certificate nor an Opinion of
Counsel shall be required in the case of a merger or consolidation in accordance with clause 1(d) above.

The respective Guarantee by each of HWP and HLT Parent, as the case may be, of a series of Notes will provide by its

terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged with respect to such series upon:

(1) (a) the release or discharge of the guarantee of HWP or HLT Parent, as applicable, under the Senior Secured Credit

Facilities (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes
of this provision); or

(b) with respect to such series of Notes, the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant

defeasance option with respect to such series as described under "—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance" or

Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be
required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer and the registrar will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note
selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer, an
Alternate Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. Also, the Issuer and the registrar will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note
for a period of 10 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or between a record date and payment date while Notes are in
definitive form. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption "—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders." The Issuer and its Affiliates may, at their discretion, at any time and from time to time
purchase Notes in the open market, pursuant to tender offers or otherwise. As market conditions warrant, we and our equity
holders, their respective affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding
debt securities or loans, including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.
Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any
purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured
debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities, or through other sources. The amounts involved in any such purchase
transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount
of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any
such purchases made at prices below the "adjusted issue price" (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in
taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to
us.

**Optional Redemption**

_The 2029 Notes_

Except as set forth below, the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem the 2029 Notes at its option prior to     , 2024. At

any time prior to    , 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, and on one or more occasions, redeem all or a part of the 2029
Notes, upon notice as described under "—Selection and Notice," at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the 2029 Notes redeemed plus the 2029 Applicable Premium as of, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
the date of redemption (the "Redemption Date"), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date.

On and after    , 2024, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem the 2029 Notes, in whole or

in part, upon notice as described under "—Selection and Notice," at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but
excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelvemonth period beginning on        of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2024 %

2025 %

2026 and thereafter 100.000 %

In addition, on or prior to    , 2023, the Issuer may, at its option, and on one or more occasions, redeem up to 40% of the

aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to   % of the aggregate


-----

principal amount of the 2029 Notes redeemed, with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds received by the Issuer from
one or more Equity Offerings or a contribution to the Issuer's common equity capital made with the net cash proceeds of an
Equity Offering, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders
of 2029 Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to
or on the Redemption Date; provided, that (a) at least 50% of (A) the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes originally
issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date and (B) the aggregate principal amount of any Additional Notes of such series
issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption
(unless all such 2029 Notes are redeemed or repurchased substantially concurrently); and (b) each such redemption occurs
within 180 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the 2029 Notes, including without limitation any

Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
2029 Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such 2029 Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making
such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the 2029 Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the
Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, given not more than 30
days following such purchase date, to redeem all 2029 Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal
to the price offered to each other Holder in such tender offer (which may be less than par and shall exclude any early tender
premium or similar premium and any accrued and unpaid interest paid to any Holder that participated in such tender offer
payment) plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding, the Redemption Date.

Notice of any redemption, whether in connection with an Equity Offering, other transaction or otherwise, may be given

prior to the completion thereof, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the related Equity Offering or other transaction. The Issuer
may redeem the 2029 Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single notice of
redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide
that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different Redemption Dates and, with respect to redemptions
that occur on the same date, may specify the order in which such redemptions are deemed to occur. In addition, if such
redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer's discretion,
the Redemption Date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived
by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the Redemption Date, or by the Redemption Date so delayed, or that such notice may be
rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all such conditions will not be satisfied
or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the
Issuer's obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. The Issuer and its Affiliates may
acquire the 2029 Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated
transactions or otherwise.

**_The 2031 Notes_**

Except as set forth below, the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem the 2031 Notes at its option prior to     , 2026. At any

time prior to    , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option, and on one or more occasions, redeem all or a part of the 2031 Notes,
upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
2031 Notes redeemed plus the 2031 Applicable Premium as of, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date.

On and after    , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem the 2031 Notes, in whole or

in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
principal amount of the 2031 Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but
excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the
twelve‑month period beginning on        of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2026 %

2027 %

2028 %

2029 and thereafter 100.000 %


-----

In addition, on or prior to    , 2023, the Issuer may, at its option, and on one or more occasions, redeem up to 40% of the

aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to   % of the aggregate
principal amount of the 2031 Notes redeemed, with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds received by the Issuer from
one or more Equity Offerings or a contribution to the Issuer’s common equity capital made with the net cash proceeds of an
Equity Offering, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders
of 2031 Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to
or on the Redemption Date; provided, that (a) at least 50% of (A) the aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes originally
issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date and (B) the aggregate principal amount of any Additional Notes of such series
issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption
(unless all such 2031 Notes are redeemed or repurchased substantially concurrently); and (b) each such redemption occurs
within 180 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the 2031 Notes, including without limitation any

Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
2031 Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such 2031 Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making
such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the 2031 Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the
Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30
days following such purchase date, to redeem all 2031 Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal
to the price offered to each other Holder in such tender offer (which may be less than par and shall exclude any early tender
premium or similar premium and any accrued and unpaid interest paid to any Holder that participated in such tender offer
payment) plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding, the Redemption Date.

Notice of any redemption, whether in connection with an Equity Offering, other transaction or otherwise, may be given

prior to the completion thereof, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the related Equity Offering or other transaction. The Issuer
may redeem the 2031 Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single notice of
redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide
that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different Redemption Dates and, with respect to redemptions
that occur on the same date, may specify the order in which such redemptions are deemed to occur. In addition, if such
redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion,
the Redemption Date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived
by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the Redemption Date, or by the Redemption Date so delayed, or that such notice may be
rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all such conditions will not be satisfied
or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the
Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. The Issuer and its Affiliates may
acquire the 2031 Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated
transactions or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Notes of a series issued under the Indenture at any time, the Trustee will select

the Notes of such series to be redeemed (a) if the Notes of such series are listed on an exchange, in compliance with the
requirements of such exchange or (b) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable, or, if the pro rata basis is not practicable for
any reason by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and otherwise in accordance with
applicable procedures of DTC in minimum denominations of $2,000 and increments of $1,000 in excess thereof. No Notes of
$2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to redeem only
the 2029 Notes, only the 2031 Notes, or any combination thereof.

Notices of redemption shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10 days but

(except as set forth in the fifth paragraph under "—Optional Redemption") not more than 60 days before the redemption date to
each Holder of Notes at such Holder's registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that
redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a
defeasance of a series of Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture with respect to any series of Notes. If any Note
is to be redeemed in part only, any notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount
thereof that has been or is to be redeemed.


-----

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, the Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the

unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note; provided, that new
Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes called
for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption, unless such redemption is conditioned on the happening of a
future event. On and after the Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control Triggering Event_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes of a series, unless

the Issuer has previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes of such series as
described under "—Optional Redemption," the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes of such series pursuant to
the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof (or such higher amount as the Issuer may determine (any Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an “Alternate
_Offer”)) (such price, the “Change of Control Payment”) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of_
purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of such series of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control
Triggering Event, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy
to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes of such series to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or
otherwise delivered in accordance with the procedures of DTC with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled "Change of Control Triggering

Event," and that all Notes of such series properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for
payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date

such notice is sent (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer
made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes of such series accepted

for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes of such series purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be

required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of such Notes
completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address
specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment
Date;

(6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be

equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must
be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $2,000;

(7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change

of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event and shall describe each such
condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer's discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed
until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as
any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the
Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole
discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied; and

(8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder

must follow.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and

regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant


-----

to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have
breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law:

(1) accept for payment all Notes of the applicable series issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to

the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes

of such series or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer's

Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to

which the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute
a default thereunder (including a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture). If we experience a change of
control that triggers a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, we could seek a
waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do
not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, such default
could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness being declared due
and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be

limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases.

The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or

discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event
purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a
transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future.
Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions,
refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but
that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit
ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under "—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock" and "—Certain
Covenants—Liens." Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the
Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if a

third party makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) in the manner, at the
times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an

Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control
Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the time of making of the
Change of Control Offer.

The definition of "Change of Control" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
"substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all or
_substantially all" of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a_


-----

Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes of a series as

a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes of such series. With respect to the Notes of a series, a Change of
Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited
with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, such series of Notes and/or the applicable Guarantees so
long as the offer to purchase a Holder’s Notes in the tender offer is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such
Holder. In addition, the Issuer or any third party approved in writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline
to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of
Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an

Asset Sale, unless:

(1) The Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of relief

from, or by any Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset
Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer at the
time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75.0% of the consideration for such Asset Sale, together with

all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuer's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet or in the

footnotes thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would
have been shown on the Issuer's or such Restricted Subsidiary's balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such
incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the Issuer) of the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are
assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from

such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer acting in good faith to be converted by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received or expected
to be received) or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalents within 180 days (450 days in the case
of any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received in respect of any Asset Sale of the Specified Real
Property Assets) following the closing of such Asset Sale; and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset

Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received
pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $710.0 million and (ii) 5.0%
of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value,

shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.


-----

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its

option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale,

(1) to permanently reduce Indebtedness as follows:

(a) Obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and to correspondingly reduce commitments with

respect thereto;

(b) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness which is secured by a Lien that is permitted by the Indenture, and to

correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(c) Obligations under the Notes or any other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and,

in the case of other Senior Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce any outstanding commitments with respect thereto,
if applicable); provided that if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so repay any Senior Indebtedness other
than the Notes, the Issuer will either (A) reduce Obligations under each series of Notes on a pro rata basis by, at its
option, (i) redeeming Notes as described under "—Optional Redemption" or (ii) purchasing Notes through openmarket purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par), or (B) make an
offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes
of such series on a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness for no less than 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon up to the principal amount of Notes to be
repurchased; or

(d) if the assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale are the property or assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that is

not a Guarantor, to permanently reduce Indebtedness of (i) a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor; or

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the

form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted
Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar
Business; or

(3) to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the

form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital
expenditures, (c) properties or (d) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (a), (b), (c) and (d), replace the businesses,
properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale;

_provided, that a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 450[th] day shall be treated as a_

permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer, or such
Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will
be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within the later of such 450[th] day and 180 days of such commitment or
letter of intent (an "Acceptable Commitment") and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for
any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into
another Acceptable Commitment (a "Second Commitment") within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided
_further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied,_
then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of the Net Proceeds

of any Asset Sale by the Issuer or a Foreign Subsidiary (a "Foreign Disposition") is (x) prohibited or materially delayed by
applicable local law or (y) prohibited or materially delayed by applicable organizational documents or any agreement from
being repatriated to the United States, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be
applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amount may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary;
provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been
required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law or the applicable
organizational document or agreement, an amount equal to such amount of Net Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be
promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually
repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has


-----

determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition could have a material
adverse tax consequence with respect to such Net Proceeds (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to,
any prepayment whereby doing so the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates and/or their
equityholders would incur a material tax liability, including as a result of a tax dividend, a deemed dividend pursuant to Code
Section 956 or a withholding tax), the Net Proceeds so affected may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Foreign
Subsidiary and an amount equal to such Net Proceeds will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The
non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt,
constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require
the Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash.

Any Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth

above will be deemed to constitute "Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million,
the Issuer shall make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to all Holders of the Notes and, if required by the terms of any
Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes ("Pari Passu Indebtedness"), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness,
to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is in an amount equal
to at least $2,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an
offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value
thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for the closing of such offer, and in the
case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness at the offer price required by the terms thereof but not to exceed 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the
agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess
Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by delivering the notice required
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect
to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds prior to the expiration
of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $200.0 million or less.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant

to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purposes not
otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case
may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall purchase the Notes and
such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the
Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari
Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any
such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset
to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Additionally, the Issuer may, at
its option, make an Asset Sale Offer using the proceeds from any Asset Sale at any time after the consummation of such Asset
Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess
Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or

waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such
consents).

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply

such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility, including under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and

regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes
pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed
to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes of a series as

a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with respect to the Notes of such series at any time with the written
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes of such series. With respect
to the Notes of a series, an Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an
amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, such series of Notes and/or the applicable Guarantees.


-----

Our future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuer becomes party may contain restrictions on the

Issuer's ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing
Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings
that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain
prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer's failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event
of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture that will apply to the Issuer and its

Restricted Subsidiaries. Neither HWP nor HLT Parent will be subject to any restrictive covenants under the Indenture.

With respect to any series of Notes, if on any date following the Issue Date(i) the Notes of such series have an Investment

Grade Rating from either of the Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture with
respect to such series of Notes, then, beginning on that day and continuing at all times thereafter regardless of any subsequent
changes in the rating of the Notes of such series, the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this
"Description of the Notes" section of this offering memorandum will no longer be applicable to the Notes of such series:

(1) "—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales";

(2) "—Limitation on Restricted Payments";

(3) "—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock";

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of "—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets";

(5) "—Transactions with Affiliates";

(6) "—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries"; and

(7) "—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries."

If the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer subject to the Covenants listed above, the Notes will be entitled to

substantially less covenant protection.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Rating.

**_Financial Calculations for Specified Transactions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket, ratio or any financial metric under the Indenture or compliance with

any provision of the Indenture (including the absence of Defaults or Events of Default), in each case in connection with (a) any
Limited Condition Transaction, (b) any incurrence or issuance of or repayment, redemption, repurchase or refinancing of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, (c) the creation of Liens, (d) the making of
any Asset Sale or any disposition excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale”, (e) the making of an Investment (including any
acquisition) or Restricted Payments, (f) the designation of a Subsidiary as restricted or unrestricted, (g) any other transaction or
plan undertaken or proposed to be undertaken in connection with such Limited Condition Transaction or any transaction set
forth in clauses (b) through (f) or (h) any other purpose under the Indenture (the transactions referred to in clauses (a) through
(h), collectively, the “Specified Transactions,” and each, a “Specified Transaction”) and any actions or transactions related
thereto, the date of determination of such basket, ratio or financial metric or whether any such Specified Transaction is
permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any Default or
Event of Default)) may, at the option of the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, a direct or indirect parent entity of the
Issuer, any successor entity of any of the foregoing (including a third party) (the “Testing Party”) (which election may be made
on or prior to the date of consummation of such Specified Transaction), be the date the definitive agreements for such Specified
Transaction are entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of a binding offer or launch of a “certain funds” tender offer),
the date of declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event, the date of the announcement of such Specified Transaction, or
the date that a notice, which may be conditional, of repayment or redemption in connection with a repayment, redemption,
repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is given to the holders of such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock or the date that an Officer’s Certificate is given with respect to the designation of a
Subsidiary as restricted or unrestricted (any such date, the “Transaction Test Date”) and such baskets, ratios or financial metrics


-----

shall be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions
set forth in the definitions of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Consolidated Secured Debt
Ratio after giving effect to such Specified Transactions and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions,
Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof,
the incurrence of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable
measurement period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Specified Transaction, and, for the
avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets, ratios or financial metrics are exceeded or are not complied with as a result of
fluctuations in such basket, ratio or related financial metrics (including due to fluctuations in Fixed Charges, Consolidated Net
Income or EBITDA of the Issuer, the target company or the Person that is otherwise the subject of the Specified Transaction
after the applicable Transaction Test Date) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Specified Transaction and any
actions or transactions related thereto, such baskets, ratios or financial metrics will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a
result of such fluctuations and (y) such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall not be tested at the time of consummation of
such Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto except as contemplated in clause (a) of the
immediately succeeding proviso; provided, however, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters
shall have become available, the Testing Party may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests, baskets or
financial metrics on the basis of such financial statements, in which case such date of redetermination shall thereafter be
deemed to be the applicable Transaction Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests, baskets or financial metrics, (b) if any
ratios or financial metrics improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, financial metrics or
baskets may be utilized, (c) if the Testing Party elects to have such determinations occur on the Transaction Test Date, any such
transactions (including the Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto) shall be deemed to have
occurred on the Transaction Test Date and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets, ratios or
financial metrics under the Indenture after the Transaction Test Date and before the consummation of such Specified
Transaction unless and until such Specified Transaction has been abandoned, as determined by the Testing Party, prior to the
consummation thereof and (d) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be
calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin, as reasonably determined by the Testing Party
in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has exercised its option pursuant to the foregoing and any Default
or Event of Default occurs in connection with the applicable Specified Transaction following the Transaction Test Date
(including any new Transaction Test Date) for the applicable Specified Transaction and prior to or on the date of the
consummation of such Specified Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be
continuing for purposes of determining whether any action that has been taken or that is being taken in connection with such
Specified Transaction was or is permitted under the Indenture.

**_Certain Compliance Calculations_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred

Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred, assumed or issued, any Lien is incurred or assumed, any Restricted Payment is made
or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured
Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, assumption,
issuance or other transaction without giving effect to amounts being utilized under any other basket (other than a ratio basket
based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio) on the same
date. Each item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is incurred, assumed or issued, each Lien incurred
or assumed and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, assumed, issued or taken first, to the
extent available, pursuant to the relevant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total
Debt Ratio test. For the avoidance of doubt, when testing the availability under a ratio basket for purposes of making a
Restricted Payment, Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) incurred, assumed or issued the proceeds of which are being utilized
to make a Restricted Payment utilizing a non-ratio basket shall not be given effect.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred

Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred, assumed or issued, any Lien is incurred or assumed or other transaction is undertaken
in reliance on a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total
Debt Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the incurrence of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility or
letter of credit facility immediately prior to or in connection therewith.

If a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one applicable

basket, permission or threshold under the Indenture, the Issuer shall be entitled to divide or classify or later divide or reclassify
(based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion
thereof) between such baskets, permission or thresholds as it shall elect from time to time.

Any calculation, test or measure that is determined with reference to the Issuer’s financial statements (including EBITDA,

Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio,
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Fixed Charges, and clause (IV)(3)(a) of the first paragraph under “—Limitation on Restricted


-----

Payments ) may be determined with reference to the financial statements of a direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer
instead, so long as such calculation, test or measure would not differ by more than an immaterial amount when using the
financial statements of such direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer as compared to if such calculation, test or measure were
made using the Issuer’s financial statements (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

Any ratios, tests or baskets required to be satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under the Indenture shall be

calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the
number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a
rounding up if there is no nearest number).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary takes an action which at the time of the taking of such action would in the good

faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the applicable provisions of the Indenture based on the financial statements
available at such time, such action shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture notwithstanding any
subsequent adjustments made in good faith to such financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income, EBITDA or other
applicable financial metric.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuer's, or any of its Restricted

Subsidiaries', Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity Interests in such Person's capacity as a holder of
such Equity Interests), including any dividend, payment or distribution payable in connection with any merger,
amalgamation or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends and distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of

the Issuer or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Equity Interests; or

(b) dividends and distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend, payment or

distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a
Wholly Owned Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend,
payment or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities;

(II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or

indirect parent company of the Issuer, including any purchase, redemption, defeasance, acquisition or retirement in
connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, in each

case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7), (8) and (9) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under

"—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock"; or

(b) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of

satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date
of purchase, repurchase or acquisition; or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exceptions thereto) being

collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments"), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(1) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional

Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described
under "—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock" (the "Fixed
_Charge Coverage Test"); and_


-----

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer

and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the 2021 Notes Issue Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1),
6(c) and (9) of the next succeeding paragraph (to the extent not deducted in calculating Consolidated Net Income), but
excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without
duplication):

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period and including

the predecessor of the Issuer) beginning on July 1, 2013 to the end of the Issuer's most recently ended fiscal quarter for
which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such
Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit; plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value of marketable securities or other property

received by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries since the 2021 Notes Issue Date (other than net cash proceeds to
the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of "—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock") from the issue or sale of:

(i) (A) Equity Interests of the Issuer, including Treasury Capital Stock (as defined below), but excluding cash

proceeds and the fair market value of marketable securities or other property received from the sale of:

(or their respective Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Issuer, any direct or
indirect parent company of the Issuer or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries after the 2021 Notes Issue Date to the
extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next
succeeding paragraph; and

(y) Designated Preferred Stock; and

(B) to the extent such net cash proceeds are (or have been) actually contributed to the Issuer or any of its

Restricted Subsidiaries, Equity Interests of the Issuer or any of the Issuer's direct or indirect parent companies
(excluding contributions of the proceeds from the sale of Designated Preferred Stock of any such companies or
contributions to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause
(4) of the next succeeding paragraph); or

(ii) Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary that has been converted into or exchanged for such

Equity Interests of the Issuer or a direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer; provided, that this clause (b) shall not
include the proceeds from (W) Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below) applied in accordance with clause (2) of
the next succeeding paragraph, (X) Equity Interests or convertible debt securities of the Issuer sold to a Restricted
Subsidiary, (Y) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock or (Z) Excluded

cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of "—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and

Investments from, Restricted Investments made by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repurchases and

or advances, and releases of guarantees, which constitute Restricted Investments made by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case after the 2021 Notes Issue Date; or


-----

(ii) the sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a

dividend or distribution (other than an Excluded Contribution) from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than, in
each case, to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a
Permitted Investment), in each case, after the 2021 Notes Issue Date; plus

(e) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or the merger,

amalgamation or consolidation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or the transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after the
2021 Notes Issue Date, the fair market value (as determined by the Issuer in good faith) of the Investment in such
Unrestricted Subsidiary (or the assets transferred) at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a
Restricted Subsidiary or at the time of such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or transfer of assets, other than to the
extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to
clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend or other distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption within 60

days after the date of declaration of the dividend or other distribution or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may
be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend or other distribution or redemption payment would have complied

principal and interest payable on any Indebtedness incurred or issued by the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent company
of the Issuer in connection with such repurchase, retirement or other acquisition); provided, that the aggregate amount of
Restricted Payments made under this clause (4) do not exceed in any calendar year an amount equal to $150.0 million (with
unused amounts in any calendar year being carried over to succeeding calendar years subject to a maximum (without
giving effect to the following proviso) of $400.0 million in any calendar year); provided, further, that such amount in any

extent contributed to the Issuer, the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests of any of the Issuer's direct or

distribution under this clause (15)(i) to permit such payment shall reduce, without duplication, Consolidated Net
Income of the Issuer to the extent, if any, that such payment would have reduced Consolidated Net Income of the
Issuer if such payment had been made directly by the Issuer and increase (or, without duplication of any reduction of
Consolidated Net Income, decrease) EBITDA to the extent, if any, that Consolidated Net Income is reduced under this
clause (15)(i) and such payment would have been added back to (or, to the extent excluded from Consolidated Net
Income, would have been deducted from) EBITDA if such payment had been made directly by the Issuer, in each case,

deemed to occur in connection with paying cash in lieu of fractional shares of such Equity Interests in connection with a

combination of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, permitted under the Indenture;

_provided, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment permitted under clause (11)(ii) above, no Event_
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment (or a portion

thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (18) above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of
"Permitted Investments," or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be entitled to
divide or classify or later divide or reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such
Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through (18) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of
the clauses contained in the definition of "Permitted Investments," in any manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not permit any

Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the penultimate sentence of the definition of
"Unrestricted Subsidiary." For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding
Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be
deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set forth in the penultimate sentence of the definition of
"Investments." Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment in such amount would be permitted at such
time, pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the definition of "Permitted Investments," and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets
the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set
forth in the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any "AHYDO catch up
payment" with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

For the purposes of this covenant, any payment made on or after the 2021 Notes Issue Date, but prior to the Issue Date,

shall be deemed to be a "Restricted Payment" to the extent that such payment would have been a Restricted Payment had the
Indenture been in effect at the time of such payment (and, to the extent that such Restricted Payment was permitted by the first
paragraph or clauses (1) through (16) above or as a Permitted Investment, such Restricted Payment may be deemed by the
Issuer to have been made pursuant to such clause).

As of September 30, 2020, the Issuer would have been able to make Restricted Payments in an amount not less than

approximately $2.5 billion pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and would have been able to make Restricted
Payments in the amount of approximately $1.7 billion pursuant to clause (10) of the second paragraph of this covenant.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue,

Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to issue Preferred Stock; provided, that the Issuer may incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
may issue shares of Preferred Stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio on a consolidated basis of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries' for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately

would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as
the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; provided
that the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or issued, as applicable, pursuant to this paragraph (plus any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof) by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed the greater of (i)

such Indebtedness exists at the date of such purchase, lease or improvement, or is created within 365 days thereafter (for
the avoidance of doubt, the purchase date for any asset shall be the later of the date of completion of construction or
installation and the beginning of the full productive use of such asset);

workers' compensation claims, performance or surety bonds, health, disability or other employee benefits or property,

regarding workers' compensation claims, performance or surety bonds, health, disability or other employee benefits or

incurrence of such Indebtedness, such obligations are reimbursed within 45 Business Days following such drawing or
incurrence;

Indebtedness incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such business, assets or a Subsidiary for the purpose of
financing such acquisition; provided, that such Indebtedness is not reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer, or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (Contingent Obligations referred to in a footnote to financial statements and not otherwise reflected
on the balance sheet will not be deemed to be reflected on such balance sheet for purposes of this clause (6));

(7) Indebtedness of the Issuer to a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, that any such Indebtedness owing to a Restricted

Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (for the avoidance of doubt,
any such Indebtedness owing to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed to be expressly

subordinated in right of payment to the Notes unless the terms of such Indebtedness expressly provide otherwise);
_provided, further, that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event which results in any_
such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness
(except to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary or any pledge of such Indebtedness constituting a Permitted Lien)
shall be deemed, in each case, to be an incurrence of such Indebtedness (to the extent such Indebtedness is then
outstanding) not permitted by this clause (7);

(8) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary; provided, that if a Subsidiary

Guarantor incurs such Indebtedness to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is subordinated in

Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such shares of Preferred Stock
(except to the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any pledge of such Capital Stock constituting a Permitted
Lien) shall be deemed in each case to be an issuance of such shares of Preferred Stock (to the extent such Preferred Stock is
then outstanding) not permitted by this clause (9);

incurrence); it being understood that any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred pursuant to this
clause (12)(b) shall cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of this clause (12)(b) but shall be deemed

under this clause (23) the greater of (i) $285.0 million and (ii) 2.0% of Total Assets (in each case, determined on the date of
such incurrence); it being understood that any Indebtedness deemed incurred pursuant to this clause (23) shall cease to be
deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of this clause (23) but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first
paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiaries could have
incurred such Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on this clause (23);

(24) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries undertaken in connection with cash management

and related activities with respect to any Subsidiary or joint venture in the ordinary course of business;

(25) Indebtedness of Foreign Subsidiaries of the Issuer in an amount not to exceed, at any one time outstanding and

together with any other Indebtedness incurred under this clause (25), 10.0% of the total assets of the Foreign Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis as shown on the Issuer's most recent balance sheet (it being understood that any Indebtedness
incurred pursuant to this clause (25) shall cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of this clause (25) but
shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries could have incurred such Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant
without reliance on this clause (25)); and

(26) Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent that the net proceeds thereof

are deposited with the Trustee at or promptly after the funding of such Indebtedness to satisfy and discharge the Notes or
exercise the Issuer's legal defeasance or covenant defeasance option as described under "—Legal Defeasance and Covenant
Defeasance," in each case, in accordance with the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the

criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in
clauses (1) through (26) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its
sole discretion, may classify or reclassify such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion
thereof) and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock in one of the above clauses or under the first paragraph of this covenant; provided, that all Indebtedness outstanding


-----

under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the Issue Date will be treated as incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of
the second paragraph above; and

(2) the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of

Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs above.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount and

the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case
may be, of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for
purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a
percentage of Total Assets under this covenant is being refinanced and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will
nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to
have been incurred under the applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence. Any
Refinancing Indebtedness and any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture to refinance Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to clauses (1), (12)(b) and (23) above shall be deemed to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock incurred to pay premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, fees and expenses in connection with
such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness,

the U.S. Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first
committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollardenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of
fees, underwriting discounts, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from

the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which
such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly,

incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated or junior in right of payment to any
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes or such Guarantor's Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated
to other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because

it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority
with respect to the same collateral or because it is guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to

exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness or any related guarantee of
Indebtedness, on any asset or property of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign
or convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless:

(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and related Guarantees of the applicable series

are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; and

(2) in all other cases, the Notes or the Guarantees of the applicable series are equally and ratably secured,


-----

except that the foregoing shall not apply to or restrict Liens securing obligations in respect of the Notes and the related
guarantees of such series.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to this covenant shall be deemed automatically and

unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of each of the Liens described in clauses (1) and (2)
above.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the incurrence

of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased
_Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness outstanding in connection with any_
accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the
form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases
in the principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or
increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

_The Issuer. The Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into, consummate a Division as the Dividing_

Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of
(including, in each case, by way of Division) all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related
transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation,

merger or Division (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition will have been made, is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization the
Issuer, as the case may be, or the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory
thereof (such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the "Successor Company"); provided, that in the case where
the surviving Person is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation;

(2) the Successor Company, if other than the Issuer, as the case may be, expressly assumes all the obligations of the

Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing transactions, as if such

transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period,

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the

Fixed Charge Coverage Test, or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to

or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to
such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, in which case clause (1)(b) of the

third succeeding paragraph shall apply, shall have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to
such Person's obligations under the Indenture and the Notes; and

(6) the Issuer or, if applicable, the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and

an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, Division or transfer and such supplemental indentures,
if any, comply with the Indenture.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Issuer under the Indenture, the Guarantees and the

Notes, as applicable, and the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture, the
Guarantees and the Notes.


-----

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding clauses (3) and (4):

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or amalgamate with or merge with or into or consummate a Division as

the Dividing Person or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor; and

(2) the Issuer may merge with an Affiliate of the Issuer or consummate a Division as the Dividing Person with an

Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in the United States, any state thereof, the District
of Columbia or any territory thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is
not increased thereby.

_Subsidiary Guarantors. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing the release of a Guarantee upon_

the sale, disposition or transfer of a Subsidiary Guarantor, no Subsidiary Guarantor will, and the Issuer will not permit any
Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into or consummate a Division as the Dividing Person
(whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose
of (including, in each case, by way of Division) all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related
transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,

amalgamation, merger or Division (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
organization of such Guarantor, as applicable, or the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia,
or any territory thereof (such surviving Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the "Successor
_Person");_

(b) the Successor Person, if other than such Guarantor, expressly assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor

under the Indenture and such Guarantor's related Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or
instruments;

(c) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists; and

(d) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating

that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture; or

(2) the transaction is made in compliance with the first paragraph of the covenant described under "—Repurchase at

the Option of Holders—Asset Sales"; or

(3) in the case of assets consisting of Equity Interests of Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, such Equity Interests are

sold, assigned, transferred, leased, conveyed or otherwise disposed of to one or more Restricted Subsidiaries.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be substituted for, such

Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor's Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor may (1) merge or consolidate with or into, wind up into or

consummate a Division as the Dividing Person or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to another Subsidiary Guarantor
or the Issuer, (2) merge or consummate a Division as the Dividing Person with an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose
of reorganizing the Subsidiary Guarantor in the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory
thereof, (3) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Subsidiary Guarantor or (4) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal
form if the Issuer determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Issuer, in each case, without regard to
the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph. Each of HWP and HLT Parent may merge with an Affiliate of the Issuer
solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing HWP or HLT Parent, as the case may be, in the United States, any
state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this "Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets"

covenant, the Issuer may contribute or transfer the Capital Stock of any or all of its Subsidiaries to any Subsidiary Guarantor.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or

otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend
any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the
Issuer (each of the foregoing, an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of
$50.0 million, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or its relevant Restricted

Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm's-length basis; or, if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no comparable
transaction is available with which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise fair to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view and when such transaction is taken in its entirety; and

(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions

involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $75.0 million, a resolution adopted by the majority of the board

letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary

Issuer or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm's-length basis;

(6) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Issue Date, or any amendment thereto (so long as any such

amendment is not disadvantageous in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the Issuer to the Holders when

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiary Guarantor unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days after the guarantee of such Indebtedness executes and delivers a

supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect
to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor's Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to
the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and


-----

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of,

any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other applicable rights against the Issuer or any other
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee; provided that this
covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became
a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary. The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60 day period
described in clause (1) above.

**Reports and Other Information**

Notwithstanding that the Issuer may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange

Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Indenture will require the Issuer to file with the SEC (with a copy to the
Trustee unless filed and available on the SEC's EDGAR website) from and after the Issue Date:

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form

(if the Issuer had been a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act), containing substantially all the
information that would be required to be contained therein, or required in such successor or comparable form;

(2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, reports on Form 10-Q or

any successor or comparable form (if the Issuer had been a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act),
containing substantially all quarterly information that would be required to be contained in Form 10-Q, or any successor or
comparable form;

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event which would have been required to be reported on a Form 8-K or

any successor or comparable form (if the Issuer had been a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act), a
current report relating to such event on Form 8-K or any successor or comparable form;

in each case, in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form (except as

described above or below and subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of information included or incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum); provided, however, that if at any time the Issuer shall not be so obligated to file such
reports referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above with the SEC or if the SEC does not permit such filing, then the Issuer will
make available such information to the Trustee, the Holders of the Notes and prospective purchasers of Notes, in each case
within 10 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will agree that, for so long
as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request,
the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating

to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to HWP or HLT Parent (or any parent entity of HWP or HLT Parent)
as long as HWP or HLT Parent, as applicable (or any such parent entity of HWP or HLT Parent) provides a Guarantee of the
Notes.

If with respect to any reporting period(s) covered in the applicable report, the Issuer's Unrestricted Subsidiaries would,

individually or in the aggregate, constitute a "significant subsidiary" (as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X
promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act (as such regulation is in effect on the Issue Date)), then the applicable annual and
quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) above shall include a supplemental section in "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" presenting (in a manner consistent with the Issuer's
historical practice) selected financial measures of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries in the aggregate (separate from the financial
information of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries).

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer will not be deemed to have failed to comply with any of its

obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under "—Events of Default and Remedies" until 120 days after the receipt of
the written notice delivered thereunder.


-----

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section Reports and Other

Information" and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with
respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an "Event of Default" with respect to the Notes of a series:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium,

if any, on the Notes of such series;

(2) default for 30 consecutive days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes of such

series;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders

of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series to comply with any of its
obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture
or the Notes of such series; provided, that no such notice may be given with respect to any action taken, and reported
publicly or to the Holders of Notes of such series, more than two years prior to such notice;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or

evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of
which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if
both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity

(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal
of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing
such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness

in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $225.0 million or more outstanding;

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the

latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under "—Reports
and Other Information") would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
$225.0 million (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by reputable insurance companies), which final
judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final,
and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor
upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of

Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal
quarter end provided as required under "—Reports and Other Information") would constitute a Significant Subsidiary); and

(7) the Guarantee of HLT Parent, HWP or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that

together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required
under "—Reports and Other Information") would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Notes of such series shall for
any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of HLT Parent, HWP
or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or the responsible officers of any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee of the
Notes of such series or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the
release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.


-----

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) with respect to the Notes of a series occurs and

is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of all the then
outstanding Notes of such series may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all
the then outstanding Notes of such series to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such
principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case
of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and
payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of
any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that
withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee will have no obligation to accelerate the Notes of a series if in the
judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the interests of the Holders of the Notes of such series.

With respect to the Notes of a series, the Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal

amount of all the then outstanding Notes of such series, by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of
the Notes of such series waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in
the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any
acceleration with respect to the Notes of such series and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of Default and

all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be
annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such
Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may

be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs with respect to the Notes of a series and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no

obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the
Notes of such series unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no
Holder of a Note of such series may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes of such series unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) the Holders of at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series have

requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders of the Notes of such series have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee

against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or

indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes of such series have not given the

Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of

acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing
_Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder_
is not Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice
of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the
Notes of a series are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction,
covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to
verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification
_Covenant”) Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary in any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee any_


-----

Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes of
such series in lieu of DTC or its nominee and such beneficial owner shall provide proof of its holdings in a manner satisfactory
to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes of such series, the Issuer

determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of
its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation
(“Litigation”) in a court of competent jurisdiction, attaching a copy of any related court filings, seeking a determination that
such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of
Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be
automatically stayed or reinstituted pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on
such matter (a “Final Decision”). Once such an Officer’s Certificate has been provided to the Trustee, the Trustee shall take no
further action pursuant to the related Noteholder Direction until a Final Decision. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder
Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes of such series, the Issuer determines in good faith that a Directing Holder
has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that such Directing Holder
failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant (a “Verification Officer’s Certificate”), the cure period with respect to such Default
shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification
Covenant, and the Trustee shall take no further action pursuant to the related Noteholder Direction until the Issuer provides a
subsequent Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee that such Verification Covenant has been satisfied (a “Covenant Satisfaction
_Officer’s Certificate”). The Company shall promptly deliver a Covenant Satisfaction Officer's Certificate following satisfaction_
by the applicable Directing Holder of its Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such
Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the
percentage of the Notes of such series held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that
such Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and
the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the

Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require
compliance with the foregoing paragraph.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in

accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation,
enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or
otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long
Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action,
staying any remedy or otherwise failing to act in accordance with a Noteholder Direction during the pendency of Litigation or a
Noteholder Direction after a Verification Officer’s Certificate has been provided to it but prior to receipt of a Covenant
Satisfaction Officer’s Certificate. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in
good faith on a Noteholder Direction.

With respect to the Notes of a series, subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in

principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes of such series are given the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines
is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note of such series or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance

with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the
Trustee a statement specifying such Default and any actions taken to rectify such Default.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, or direct or indirect member, partner or stockholder of

the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than in their respective capacity as Issuer or Guarantor) or of any of their respective direct or
indirect parent companies shall have any liability, for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the
Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for


-----

issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view
of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

With respect to any series of Notes, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Notes of such

series or the applicable Guarantees, as the case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon
payment in full of all of the Notes of such series. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations
discharged with respect to the Notes of such series and have each Guarantor's obligation discharged with respect to its
Guarantee of the Notes of such series ("Legal Defeasance") and cure all then existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes of such series to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and

interest on the Notes of such series when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to Notes of such series concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of

such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money
for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer's obligations in connection therewith;

and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each Guarantor released

with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture with respect to any series of
Notes ("Covenant Defeasance") and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with
respect to the Notes of such series. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under "—Events of Default and Remedies"
will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series.

To the extent the Issuer exercises its option to effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, such election may be

made with respect to the 2029 Notes only, the 2031 Notes only, or any combination thereof:

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes of a series:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes of such

series, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in
the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest due on the Notes of such series on the stated maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of such
principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes and the Issuer must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to
maturity or to a particular redemption date; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium with respect to any series of Notes, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to such Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the
notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the "Applicable Premium Deficit")
only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall
be set forth in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium
Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming

that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a

ruling, or

(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary

assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for


-----

U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel

confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes of such series will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be

applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the
granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default

under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting
from any borrowing of funds to be applied to make the deposit required to effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case, the granting of
Liens in connection therewith);

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the

Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others;
and

(7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of

Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes of a series, when either:

(1) all Notes of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes of such

series which have been replaced or paid and Notes of such series for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited
in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable

by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and payable within one year or are to be
called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes of such
series, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as
will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the
Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued
interest to the date of maturity or redemption; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the
Applicable Premium with respect to any series of Notes, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to such Applicable Premium calculated as of the
date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or
prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer's Certificate delivered to
the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(b) no Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit or any

similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection
therewith) with respect to the Indenture or the Notes of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date
of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other material agreement or instrument (other


-----

than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound
(other than resulting from any borrowing of funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous
deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture with respect to such series of

Notes; and

(d) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the

payment of the Notes of such series at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all

conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, any Guarantee and the Notes of a series may be

amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all the Notes then
outstanding of each series affected thereby, including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes of such series, and any existing Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the
Notes of a series issued thereunder may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the
then outstanding Notes of each series affected, other than Notes of such series beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes of such series).

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Notes, an amendment or waiver may not,

with respect to any Notes of a series held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or alter or waive the provisions with

respect to the redemption of such Notes (other than provisions relating to (a) notice periods (to the extent consistent with
applicable requirements of clearing and settlement systems) for redemption and conditions to redemption and (b) the
covenants described above under the caption "—Repurchase at the Option of Holders");

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(4) waive a Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes, except a rescission of

acceleration of such Notes by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the Notes of such series then outstanding,
and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or provision contained
in the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee which cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all affected
Holders of Notes of such series;

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the contractual rights of

Holders to receive payments of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or the Notes of any Holder to institute suit for the

enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of such Notes that would adversely affect the Holders; or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantees of any Significant Subsidiary, or any group

of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer),
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, in any manner materially adverse to the Holders of such Notes.


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture to which it is a

party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture with respect to any series of Notes and any Guarantee or Notes
of a series without the consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of assets;

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer's or any Guarantor's obligations to the Holders;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not materially

adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder;

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any

Guarantor;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes of a series in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under

the Trust Indenture Act;

(9) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee or a

successor paying agent thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(10) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer or legending of the Notes;

(11) to add an obligor or a Guarantor under the Indenture or to release an obligor or a Guarantor in accordance with the

terms of the Indenture;

(12) to conform the text of the Indenture, Guarantees or the Notes of a series to any provision of this "Description of

the Notes" to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a
provision of the Indenture, Guarantee or Notes of such series as provided in an Officer's Certificate;

(13) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as

permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration of the Notes;
_provided, however, that such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;_

(14) to secure the Notes of a series and/or the related Guarantees or to add collateral thereto; or

(15) to make any other modifications to the Notes of such series or the Indenture with respect to such series of a

formal, minor or technical nature or necessary to correct a manifest error, so long as such modification does not adversely
affect the rights of any Holders of Notes of such series in any material respect.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a creditor of the

Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as
security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting
interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as Trustee (if the Indenture
has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act) or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes of a series

will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not
be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct
of his own affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request of any Holder of the Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to
the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and any Guarantee will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of

New York.

under any revolving credit facility unless such Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced) or issues
or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio is made (the "Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date"), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or
extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation of Fixed

Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock" (and for the purposes of other provisions of the Indenture that refer to such
first paragraph) shall not give effect to any Indebtedness being incurred on such date (or on such other subsequent date which

the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period

basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, Divisions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and
discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting
therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person
that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, Divisions, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, Divisions, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or discontinued operation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an Investment, acquisition, disposition,

Divisions, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or discontinued operation, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good
faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings,
synergies and operating expense reductions resulting from such Investment, acquisition, disposition, Division, merger,
amalgamation or consolidation which is being given pro forma effect that have been or are expected to be realized based on
actions taken, committed to be taken or expected in good faith to be taken within 18 months). If any Indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in
effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The notes are being offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”). The

notes also may be offered and sold to persons other than U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
(“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, all the notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. Notes will be issued at the closing of this
offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons

(collectively, “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes initially will be represented by one or more temporary global
notes in registered form without interest coupons (collectively, “Regulation S Temporary Global Notes”). Through and
including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering (the “Distribution
Compliance Period”), beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be held only through the Euroclear
System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a
person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below
under “Exchanges among Global Notes.” The Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more
permanent notes in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, “Regulation S Permanent Global Notes”)
only after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and then only upon delivery of certification in form reasonably
satisfactory to Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) of compliance with the transfer restrictions
applicable to the notes and pursuant to Regulation S as provided in the indenture. Regulation S Temporary Global Notes and
Regulation S Permanent Global Notes are referred to herein as “Regulation S Global Notes” and Rule 144A Global Notes and
Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as “Global Notes.”

Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the Trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of DTC or

its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Beneficial
interests in Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in Regulation S Global Notes at any time
except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges Among Global Notes.” Except as set forth below,
Global Notes may be transferred only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee, in whole and not in
part. Except in the limited circumstances described below, beneficial interests in Global Notes may not be exchanged for notes
in certificated form and owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes
in certificated form. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.”

Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S Global Notes (including beneficial interests in the notes they represent) will be

subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will bear restrictive legends as described under “Notice to Investors; Transfer
Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures
of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including Euroclear and Clearstream), which may change from time to time.

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a

matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and
are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the
system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a

“banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a
“clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the
provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations
(collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the
Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers
and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations.
Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through
or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”).
Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or
the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf
of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.


-----

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with

portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be

effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the
Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes).

Investors in 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through

DTC. Investors in 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations
(including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the
procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through
Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants.
After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S
Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will
hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their
respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear,
and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the
depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to
the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some
states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer
beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because
DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having
beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise
take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not

receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will not be considered the
registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC

or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the
indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the
owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the
Trustee (or any of its agents) or any agent of the Issuer has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on

account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s
records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global
Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes

(including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date
unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an
amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the
records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed
by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants
and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any
delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may
conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between

Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating
procedures.


-----

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between

the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in
accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however,
such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the
counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of
such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver
instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests
in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day
funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to
the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the direction of one or

more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant
direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for
legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are
under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by

DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the
rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

Prior to any exchange of any beneficial interest in a Regulation S Temporary Global Note for a beneficial interest in a

Regulation S Permanent Global Note:

   - the holder of the beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note must provide Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the indenture certifying that the beneficial
owner of the interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that has
purchased that interest in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act; and

   - Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the applicable Trustee (or the paying agent if other than
such Trustee) a certificate in the form required by the indenture.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note if:

   - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global Notes or (b) has
ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a successor depositary is not
appointed;

   - we at our option, notify, the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes (although
Regulation S Temporary Global Notes at the Issuer’s election pursuant to this clause may not be exchanged for
Certificated Notes prior to (a) the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and (b) the receipt of any
certificates required under the provisions of Regulation S); or

   - there has occurred and is continuing a Default with respect to the notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written notice given

to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange
for any Global Note or beneficial interests in a Global Note will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved
denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the
applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by
applicable law.


-----

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

If Certificated Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in any Global Note

unless the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that the
transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to the notes being transferred. See “Notice to Investors;
Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Temporary Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a Regulation S

Permanent Global Note only after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and then only upon provision of the
certification described above under “—Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes.”

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be

exchanged for beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

   - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

   - the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that
the notes are being transferred:

   - to a Person who (i) the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule
144A and (ii) is purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

   - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an

interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, only if
the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that the
transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A Global Note

will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian
system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the
principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one
of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will,
upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the original Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and,
accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in the
other Global Note.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of notes represented by Global Notes, including payments of principal, premium, if any,

and interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the DTC or its nominee. We will make
all payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no account is specified, by mailing a check to each
Holder’s registered address. See “Description of the Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” Notes represented by Global
Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market
trading activity in notes represented by Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available
funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest
in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or
Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and
Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised us that cash received in Euroclear or
Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a
Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or
Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The notes offered hereby have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and they

may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes
offered hereby are being offered and sold only (a) to qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A under the
Securities Act and (b) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons
(“foreign purchasers,” which term includes dealers or other professional fiduciaries in the United States acting on a
discretionary basis for foreign beneficial owners, other than an estate or trust) in offshore transactions meeting the requirements
of Rule 903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act. As used herein, the terms “offshore transaction,” “United States” and
“U.S. person” have the respective meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with

the Issuer and the initial purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other

applicable securities law, are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act
or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and may not be offered,
sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other
applicable securities law, pursuant to an exemption therefrom, or in a transaction not subject thereto, and in each case
in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (4) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate,” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, of us, or acting on our behalf and it is either:

sale of notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, buying for its own account or for the account of
another qualified institutional buyer, or

(b) an institution that, at the time the buy order for the notes was originated, was outside the United States and

was not a U.S. person (and was not purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S. person) within the meaning
of Regulation S under the Securities Act.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer or the initial purchasers or any person representing the Issuer or the initial

purchasers has made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer or the offering or sale of any notes, other than
the information contained in this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and
upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the notes. Accordingly, it acknowledges that
no representation or warranty is made by the initial purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials. It
has had access to such financial and other information concerning the Issuer and the notes as it has deemed necessary
in connection with its decision to purchase any of the notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request
information from the Issuer.

(4) It is purchasing the notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary

agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution
thereof in violation of the Securities Act, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability
to resell notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any exemption from registration available under the Securities
Act.

It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the notes, and each subsequent

holder of the notes by its acceptance thereof will agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such notes during the holding period
then imposed by Rule 144, or its successor, after the later of the date of the original issue and the last date on which we or any
of our affiliates were the owner of such notes, or any predecessor thereto (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”), only

(a) to the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries,

(b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act,


-----

(c) for so long as the notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a

qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own account or for the account of a qualified institutional
buyer to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A,

(d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States within the meaning of

Regulation S under the Securities Act, or

each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of
such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any
applicable state securities laws.

Each purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer and the Trustee reserve the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer of the

notes pursuant to clause (e) above prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date to require delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us and the Trustee. Each purchaser acknowledges that each security will

RIGHT PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (E) TO REQUIRE THE
DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO
EACH OF THEM.

security.

(6) If it is a purchaser in a sale that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S, it acknowledges

that until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period within the meaning of Rule 903 of Regulation S,

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences to non-U.S. holders (as

defined below) of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes offered hereby as of the date of this offering
memorandum. Unless otherwise stated, this summary deals only with notes held as capital assets (within the meaning of Section
1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) by persons who purchase the notes for cash upon
original issuance at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money to investors,
excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement
agent or wholesaler).

As used herein, and except as modified for estate tax purposes (as discussed below), a “non-U.S. holder” means a

beneficial owner of the notes offered hereby (other than an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes) that is not, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

   - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under
applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

If any entity classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds notes, the tax treatment of a

partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a
partner in a partnership considering an investment in the notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to

you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including, without
limitation, a “controlled foreign corporation,” a “passive foreign investment company,” a United States expatriate or a
beneficial owner of the 2024 Notes.

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as of

the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal
income and estate tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from
the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not
take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes that are different from
those discussed below. Moreover, we cannot assure you that a change in law will not alter significantly the tax considerations
that we describe in this summary.

This summary does not represent all aspects of the United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you in light

of your particular circumstances and does not address the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. It is not
intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular purchaser of notes. If you are
**considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States**
**federal income and estate tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes, as well as the**
**consequences to you arising under other United States federal tax laws (including the gift tax and the Medicare tax on**
**certain investment income) and under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

_United States federal withholding tax. Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and “FATCA” below, United_

States federal withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under the “portfolio interest rule,” provided
that:

   - interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States;


-----

you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our
voting stock within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States Treasury regulations;

   - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us actually (or constructively) through stock ownership;

   - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and

   - either (a) you provide your name and address on an applicable IRS Form W-8 and certify, under penalties of perjury,
that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code or (b) you hold your notes through certain foreign
intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special
certification rules apply to non-U.S. holders that are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to a 30% United

States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed:

   - IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as appropriate (or other applicable form) certifying an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

   - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not subject to withholding tax
because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (as discussed below
under “—United States federal income tax”).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain that you realize

on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other disposition of a note.

_United States federal income tax. If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is_

effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a United States permanent establishment), then you will generally be subject to United States federal income tax
on that interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code. In
addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or a lower applicable income
tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments. If interest received with respect to the
notes is effectively connected income (whether or not a treaty applies), the 30% withholding tax described above will not apply,
provided the certification requirements discussed above in “—United States federal withholding tax” are satisfied.

Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, any gain realized on the disposition of a note generally

will not be subject to United States federal income tax unless:

   - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment), in which case you will be
taxed in the same manner as discussed above with respect to effectively connected interest; or

   - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition,
and certain other conditions are met, in which case you will be subject to a flat rate of 30% United States federal
income tax on any gain recognized (except as otherwise provided by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be
offset by certain United States source losses.

_United States federal estate tax. If you are an individual who is neither a citizen nor a resident of the United States (as_

specifically defined for estate tax purposes), your estate will not be subject to United States federal estate tax on notes
beneficially owned by you (or treated as so owned) at the time of your death, provided that any interest payment to you on the
notes would be eligible for exemption from the 30% United States federal withholding tax under the “portfolio interest rule”
described above under “—United States federal withholding tax” without regard to the statement requirement described in the
fifth bullet point of that section.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Information reporting requirements generally will apply to the amount of interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any,

withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and any


-----

withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside under the provisions of an
applicable income tax treaty or agreement.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the notes that we make to

you provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United
States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent has received from you the required certification that you
are a non-U.S. holder described above in the fifth bullet point under “—Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders—
United States federal withholding tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds of a sale or

other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of notes within the United States or conducted through certain United
States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the payer under penalties of perjury that you are a non-U.S. holder
(and the payer does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the
Code), or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed

as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as “FATCA”), a 30% United States

federal withholding tax may apply to any interest income paid on the notes to (i) a “foreign financial institution” (as specifically
defined in the Code and whether such foreign financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary) which does not
provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y)
its compliance (or deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of compliance with an
intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in a manner which avoids withholding, or (ii) a “non-financial foreign
entity” (as specifically defined in the Code and whether such non-financial foreign entity is the beneficial owner or an
intermediary) which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an
exemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United States beneficial owners of such
entity (if any). If an interest payment is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed
above under “—Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders—United States federal withholding tax,” the withholding
under FATCA may be credited against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax. You should consult your own tax
advisors regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to your ownership and disposition of the notes.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes by any (i)

“employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and other programs or arrangements
that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any other U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state, local or other laws or
regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and (iii) entities whose
underlying assets are considered to include the assets of any of the foregoing described in clause (i) and (ii) (each of the
foregoing described in clause (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, referred to herein as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section

4975 of the Code (a “Covered Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Covered Plan and its fiduciaries
or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders
investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the
Covered Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether

the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar
Laws and whether the investment is permitted under the terms of the applicable documents governing the Plan.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified transactions

involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or
disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of the notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, a guarantor or any of their

respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is
held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S.
Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and
holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by
independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE
91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE
96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section
4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for
certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or
exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan
involved in the transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan pays no more than “adequate consideration” in
connection with the transaction. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance of these
or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any
class exemption or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes, or that if
an exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA)

and non-United States plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such Plans should consult with their
counsel before purchasing any notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and if
necessary, the availability of, and exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws.


-----

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing plan assets of any Plan,

unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or a
similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**_Representation_**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and

warranted that either (i) it is not, and is not acquiring the notes with any assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition and holding of
the notes will not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a
similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor should it be construed as legal

advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing or holding the notes
on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section
4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and
holding of the notes.

The sale of notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuer that such an investment meets all relevant legal

requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for
Plans generally or any particular Plan.

**Principal Amount of**

**the 2029 Notes**


Total $                  $

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed, severally and

not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of these notes are purchased. If an initial
purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers
may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated. The offering of the notes by the initial purchasers is subject to
receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.

We and the guarantors have agreed to indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities

under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

The representative has advised us that the initial purchasers propose initially to offer the notes at the offering price set forth

on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price or any other term of the offering
may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The initial

purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or applicable
state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The initial purchasers will not offer or sell the
notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S.
persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the
commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the
offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance
with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes will be deemed to
have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions.”

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes

on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation system We have been


-----

advised by certain of the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the notes after completion of the
offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without
any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not
develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating
performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about     , 2020, which will be the  business day

following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as "T+ "). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the second business day before      the
delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+, to specify an alternate
settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade
the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors.

We have agreed that we will not, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 30 days after the date of this offering

memorandum, without first obtaining the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, directly or indirectly, issue, sell,
offer to contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities, except for the notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the purchase
agreement.

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open market. These

transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales
involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the
offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is
more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in
the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, any purchases by the initial purchasers’ to cover the syndicate short sales may have

the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the
notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers makes any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any

effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the initial
purchasers makes any representation that the representative will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once
commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Canada**

The notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited

investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act
(Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and
Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or

damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the
remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation
of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of
the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a non-Canadian

jurisdiction, section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the initial purchasers are not
required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with
this offering.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,

which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment
research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services.
Some of the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment
banking, advisory roles and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have
received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Certain of the initial purchasers
or their respective affiliates are agents and/or lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make

or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and
securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the initial purchasers or their respective
affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of
those initial purchasers or their affiliates currently hedge and are likely to hedge in the future, certain of those initial purchasers
or their affiliates are likely to hedge and certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge their credit exposure to
us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such initial purchasers and their respective affiliates
would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or
short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their
respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short
positions in such securities and instruments. Finally, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be
holders of the 2024 Notes, for which they would be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of the net proceeds of this offering
that we use to fund the redemption of such notes.
