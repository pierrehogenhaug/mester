1756_1,Offerings 2021.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"The rules of the SEC regulate the use in filings with the SEC of “non-GAAP financial measures,” such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and net debt and certain related ratios, that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We have included and incorporated by reference EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and net debt metrics in this offering memorandum because we believe that they provide investors with additional information to measure our performance and evaluate our ability to service our debt. Our use of the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and net debt may vary from the use of such terms by others in our industry and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss), revenues, debt presented in accordance with GAAP or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or to cash flows as measures of liquidity. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization. We evaluate our operating performance using a metric we refer to as “Adjusted EBITDA” which we calculate as EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses, revenues and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated equity investments; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) replacement reserves ----- required under certain lease agreements; (v) reorganization costs, severance, relocation and other related expenses; (vi) sharebased compensation expense; (vii) non-cash impairment; (viii) amortization of contract acquisition costs; (ix) the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties; and (x) other items. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. Additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. For instance, interest expense and income taxes are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore could vary significantly across companies. Depreciation and amortization, as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs, are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used. For Adjusted EBITDA, we also exclude items such as: (i) FF&E replacement reserves for leased hotels to be consistent with the treatment of FF&E for owned hotels, where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the FF&E; (ii) share-based compensation expense, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; (iii) the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses, as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts; and (iv) other items, including reorganization and related severance costs, that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives, either in isolation or as a substitute, for net income (loss), cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect income tax expenses or benefits or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use to evaluate our financial leverage. Net debt is calculated as (i) longterm debt, including current maturities and excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount, and (ii) the Company’s share of unconsolidated affiliate debt, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs, reduced by (a) cash and cash equivalents and (b) restricted cash and cash equivalents. Net debt should not be considered as a substitute to debt presented in accordance with GAAP. Net debt may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe net debt provides useful information about our indebtedness to investors as it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to compare the indebtedness of companies. ----- Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, presented herein, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is included as it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to compare the financial condition of companies. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio should not be considered as an alternative to measures of financial condition derived in accordance with GAAP, and it may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies. The SEC’s rules require, among other things: - presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; - a quantitative reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; - a statement disclosing the reasons why the registrant’s management believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors; and - a statement disclosing the additional purposes, if any, for which the registrant’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measure. These rules prohibit, among other things: - exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner from non-GAAP liquidity measures; - adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur; and - presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of any financial statement prepared in accordance with GAAP or pro forma financial information. The non-GAAP financial measures presented and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum may not comply with the SEC’s rules and may be changed in or excluded from our future filings with the SEC.",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

As a result, the consolidated financial information included and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum with respect to HLT Parent is substantially the same as the Issuer’s financial information. As used in this offering memorandum, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, references to: - ""Hilton,"" ""the Company,"" ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"" refer to HLT Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Issuer; - ""ADR"" or ""average daily rate"" means hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period; - ""comparable hotels"" mean those hotels that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period, and open January 1st of the previous year; (ii) have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods presented; and (iii) have not sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, undergone large-scale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available. When considering business interruption in the context of our definition of comparable hotels, any hotel that had completely or partially suspended operations on a temporary basis at any point during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was considered to be part of the definition of comparable hotels. Despite these temporary suspensions of hotel operations, we believe that including these hotels within occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room reflects the underlying results of our business for the nine months ended September 30, 2020; - ""Existing Senior Notes"" refers to our outstanding 5.375% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), our outstanding 2026 Notes, our outstanding 4.875% Senior Notes due 2027 (the ""2027 Notes""), our outstanding 5.750% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”), our outstanding 3.750% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), our outstanding 4.875% Senior Notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) and our outstanding 4.000% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”); - ""HLT Parent"" refers to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation, that is the ultimate parent entity of the Issuer and will be a parent guarantor of the notes; - ""HWP"" refers to Hilton Worldwide Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, that is the direct parent company of the Issuer and will be a parent guarantor of the notes; - ""Issuer"" refers to Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc., a Delaware corporation, that is the issuer of the notes offered hereby; - ""occupancy"" means the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period; - ""RevPAR"" or ""revenue per available room"" means hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period; - ""RevPAR index"" measures a hotel's relative share of its segment's revenue per available room. For example, if a subject hotel's RevPAR is $50 and the RevPAR of its competitive set is $50, the subject hotel would have no RevPAR index premium. If the subject hotel's RevPAR totaled $60, its RevPAR index premium would be 20%, which indicates that the subject hotel has outperformed other hotels in its competitive set; and - our ""hotels"" and ""rooms"" refer to the hotels and resorts managed, franchised, owned or leased by us.

1756_1,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,COVID-19 Pandemic,9.2.1,,"During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives in place at various times during the period, resulting in cancellations and significantly reduced travel around the world. The reduction in travel has resulted in complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations in many of the locations where our hotels are located for an indeterminate duration. This disruption to our business largely began in mid-March, and included approximately 20 percent of our global hotel properties for some portion of the year to date period. As such, the pandemic had a material adverse impact on our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and, based on the potential impact of further restrictions and health and safety concerns, we expect it to continue to have a material adverse impact on our results in future periods. As of December 31, 2020, 96 percent of our global hotel properties were open, while approximately 230 hotels had temporarily suspended operations. Certain geographic areas have re-imposed additional travel restrictions, which may result in further adverse impacts to our hotel operations. Hotels that have reopened or remained open generally have experienced significantly lower occupancy as compared with periods before the onset of the pandemic. In response to this global crisis, we have taken actions to prioritize the safety and security of our guests, employees and owners and support our communities. We found alternative uses for certain of our hotel properties, including providing housing for first responders and healthcare workers, and provided financial assistance to organizations helping those affected by COVID-19 through our Hilton Effect Foundation. Additionally, we have taken several steps to help our business withstand this uncertain time, which have included: (i) fully drawing down on our $1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below); (ii) suspending dividend payments and share repurchases; (iii) implementing strict cost management measures, such as temporarily halting certain marketing programs, temporarily eliminating non-essential expenses, including capital expenditures, and reducing payroll and related costs through workforce reductions, furloughs and temporary salary reductions; (iv) consummating the pre-sale of Hilton Honors points to American Express for $1.0 billion in cash; and (v) issuing $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in April 2020. After considering our approach to liquidity and accessing our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures and other commitments for the foreseeable future both prior to and giving effect to this offering. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

(2) On February 29, 2020, we merged Hilton Worldwide Finance LLC (“HWF”), the original issuer of the 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes and the original borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, with and into the Issuer with the Issuer continuing as the surviving entity. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities consist of: (i) a $1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) a $2,619 million senior secured term loan facility due 2026 (the “Term Loan”). In March 2020, as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we fully drew down on our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2020, in addition to our outstanding debt balance of $1.69 billion under our Revolving Credit Facility, we also had $60 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. On January 13, 2021, we paid down $250 million of the outstanding Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, we anticipate that we may obtain up to approximately $75 million in additional letters of credit to be issued under the Revolving Credit Facility in January 2021. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Credit Facilities.” (3) For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented $462 million, or 38%, of our total revenues, excluding other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and $(54) million of our Adjusted EBITDA, driven by losses in our ownership segment. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

Although, there are effective vaccines for COVID-19 that have been approved for use, distribution of the vaccines did not begin until late 2020, and a majority of the public will likely not have access to a vaccination until sometime later in 2021. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a material negative impact on our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and our preliminary estimated results for the year ended December 31, 2020, and will continue to negatively affect future results. The current and uncertain future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel and use our hotel properties for lodging, food and beverage and other services, is expected to continue to negatively affect our results, operations, outlook, plans, growth, cash flows and liquidity. During the pandemic, the U.S. and other national and local governments have imposed travel restrictions at various times and, in some countries and U.S. states, re-imposed such restrictions, and a number of our hotels have fully or partially suspended operations. We have been and expect to continue to be negatively affected by additional governmental regulations and travel advisories to fight the pandemic, including recommendations by the U.S. Department of State, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. We cannot predict when any of our hotels that have completely or partially suspended operations will be able to fully reopen, the conditions upon which a full reopening may occur or the effects of any such conditions. We also cannot predict if any of our hotels that are currently operational will have to completely or partially suspend operations in the future. Moreover, even where travel advisories and restrictions have been lifted, travel demand has been and is likely to remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict if or when our properties will return to pre-pandemic demand or pricing. Although we have implemented new hygiene and cleaning standards, we cannot fully predict their impact on people believing it is safe to travel. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, will also negatively affect travel demand. The steps we have taken to reduce operating costs, including temporarily reducing compensation, reducing our workforce and furloughing a substantial number of our employees, and further steps we may take in the future to reduce costs for us or our third-party hotel owners, may negatively affect our brand reputation and ability to attract and retain employees. If our furloughed employees do not return to work with us when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, including because they find new jobs during the furlough, we may face operational challenges that could negatively affect hotel results, guest experience and loyalty. We also may face demands or requests from labor unions that represent employees at our hotels for additional compensation, healthcare benefits or other terms, including making payments to underfunded multi-employer pension plans for covered union employees, as a result of the pandemic that could increase costs, and we could experience labor issues as we implement our mitigation plans. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we could still experience long-term impacts on our operating costs as a result of attempts to counteract future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other viruses through, for example, enhanced health and hygiene requirements or other such measures in one or more regions. ----- We cannot predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our partners, such as third-party owners of our properties, third-party service providers, travel agencies, suppliers and other vendors. In particular, if third-party owners of our hotels are unable to maintain their hotels and service indebtedness secured by their hotels, our results of operations and reputation could suffer. Third-party owners of our hotels have experienced financing difficulties and significant declines in revenues, thereby making it more likely that they could declare bankruptcy or face other difficulties with their lenders or other creditors. Bankruptcies, sales or foreclosures involving our hotels could, in some cases, result in the termination of our management or franchise contracts and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows, including amounts currently due to us under existing agreements, which would negatively affect our results of operations. Hotel owners with financial difficulties have been and may continue to be unable or unwilling to pay us amounts that we are entitled to under our existing contracts on a timely basis or at all. Current and ongoing economic conditions also could affect our ability to enter into management and franchise contracts with potential third-party owners of our hotels, who may be unable to obtain financing or face other delays in developing hotel projects. As a result, some properties in our development pipeline may not enter our system when we anticipated, or at all, and new hotels may enter our pipeline at a slower rate than in the past, thereby negatively affecting our overall growth. Likewise, if we or our hotel owners or franchisees are unable to access capital to make physical improvements to our hotels, the quality of our hotels may suffer, which may negatively impact our reputation and guest loyalty, and our market share may suffer as a result. We may be required to raise additional capital in the future, and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our prospects and our credit ratings. Certain of our credit ratings have been downgraded or placed on credit watch, and if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry or us, our access to capital and the cost of any debt financing would be negatively affected. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, or require incremental collateral, which may further restrict our business operations. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. In addition, because of reduced travel demand, certain of our leased properties will not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, which may include rent due to the landlords of those properties. If or when we determine the value of our leased properties or the carrying value of other assets has significantly declined, we have recognized and in the future could have to recognize significant non-cash impairment charges to our results of operations. Further, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacts spending patterns of Hilton Honors co-branded credit cardholders or the acquisition of new cardholders, we will receive lower license fees under our co-branded credit card arrangements. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and could cause a global recession, which would have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations. The significant increase in unemployment in the U.S. and other regions due to the adoption of social distancing and other policies to slow the spread of COVID-19 continues to have a sustained negative impact on travel demand. The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the travel industry at large remains highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak, the timing and availability of vaccinations and other treatments to combat COVID-19, and the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to stabilize and normal economic and operating conditions to resume. Given the uncertainty as to the extent and timing of the potential future spread or mitigation of COVID-19 and the imposition or relaxation of protective measures, we are presently unable to estimate the full impact to our future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our internal controls over financial reporting as we have reduced our workforce and placed many of our employees on temporary furlough. Our remaining employees have been required to work from home and, therefore, new processes, procedures and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment. Further, should any key employees become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work, the attention of our management team could be diverted. The potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could intensify or otherwise affect many of our other risk factors that are included in “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” of HLT Parent’s 2019 Annual Report, including, but not limited to, risks inherent to the hospitality industry, macroeconomic factors beyond our control, competition for hotel guests and management and franchise contracts, risks related to doing business with third-party hotel owners, performance of our information technology systems, growth of reservation channels outside of our system, risks of doing business outside of the U.S. and risks related to our indebtedness. Because the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the other potential impacts to our risk factors that are further described in HLT Parent’s 2019 Annual Report are uncertain. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could increase. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences to the holders of the notes, including the following: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and our other debt; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; - requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; - limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; - placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and - increasing our cost of borrowing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. ----- In addition, certain of our variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform.

A court might also void the issuance of the notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors, if the court found that we issued the notes or the guarantors entered into the guaranty agreements with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud our or their respective creditors. A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or the guarantees if we or a guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. If a court were to void the issuance of the notes or the guarantees, you would no longer have a claim against us or the guarantors. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the guarantors or, with respect to the notes, any guarantee. In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes made at a time when we were subsequently found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or to a fund for the benefit of our creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give the creditors more than such creditors would have received in a liquidation under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “Bankruptcy Code”). ----- The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent and preferential transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent or preferential transfer has occurred. Generally, however, we would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of our debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair saleable value of all our assets; - the present fair saleable value of our assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay our probable liability on existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - we could not pay our debts as they become due. After giving effect to the indebtedness incurred in this offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we believe we will not be insolvent, will not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which we are engaged and will not have incurred debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they mature. There can be no assurance, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making such determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard. The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. We cannot assure you that this limitation will protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due. Furthermore, in Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc. v Citicorp North America, Inc. (“TOUSA”), the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause that will be included in the indenture governing the notes was unenforceable. As a result, the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the liability findings of the Bankruptcy Court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally. If the TOUSA decision were followed by other courts, the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased. In addition, although each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holders of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the guarantees thereof will be secured by substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and any existing and future subsidiary guarantors, including all of the capital stock of the Issuer and each restricted subsidiary (which, in the case of foreign subsidiaries, is limited to 65% of the capital stock of each first-tier foreign subsidiary). The notes are effectively subordinated to all such secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of that collateral. If an event of default occurs under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of the holders of the notes, even if we are in default with respect to the notes. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them (including all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure dissolution winding-up liquidation reorganization or other bankruptcy proceeding ----- holders of the notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as such notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, holders of such notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness. As of September 30, 2020, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount, we had approximately $4,577 million of secured indebtedness outstanding, and, on a pro forma basis, we would have had approximately $4,327 million of secured indebtedness outstanding.

As of September 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis, the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had approximately $10.1 billion of total debt outstanding, including approximately $4,095 million of secured indebtedness outstanding, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount. Only HLT Parent, HWP and the Issuer's U.S. Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries that guarantee certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor will guarantee the Notes. None of the Issuer’s Foreign Subsidiaries or nonwholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are or will be required to guarantee the Notes.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes. The Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness which may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor's obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor's liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do ----- not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ""—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock"" and ""—Certain Covenants—Liens."" Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of ""Change of Control"" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ""substantially all,"" there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ""all or _substantially all"" of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a_ Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. A Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees so long as the offer to purchase a Holder’s Notes in the tender offer is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Issuer or any third party approved in writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to permanently reduce Indebtedness as follows: (a) Obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (b) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness which is secured by a Lien that is permitted by the Indenture, and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (c) Obligations under the Notes or any other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of other Senior Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce any outstanding commitments with respect thereto, if applicable); provided that if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so repay any Senior Indebtedness other than the Notes, the Issuer will either (A) reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis by, at its option, (i) redeeming Notes as described under ""—Optional Redemption"" or (ii) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par), or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon up to the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased; or (d) if the assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale are the property or assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, to permanently reduce Indebtedness of (i) a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor; or (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, ----- owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business; or (3) to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures, (c) properties or (d) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (a), (b), (c) and (d), replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; _provided, that a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 450[th] day shall be treated as a_ permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer, or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within the later of such 450[th] day and 180 days of such commitment or letter of intent (an ""Acceptable Commitment"") and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a ""Second Commitment"") within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided _further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied,_ then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by the Issuer or a Foreign Subsidiary (a ""Foreign Disposition"") is (x) prohibited or materially delayed by applicable local law or (y) prohibited or materially delayed by applicable organizational documents or any agreement from being repatriated to the United States, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amount may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law or the applicable organizational document or agreement, an amount equal to such amount of Net Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition could have a material adverse tax consequence with respect to such Net Proceeds (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates and/or their equityholders would incur a material tax liability, including as a result of a tax dividend, a deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding tax), the Net Proceeds so affected may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary and an amount equal to such Net Proceeds will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. Any Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth above will be deemed to constitute ""Excess Proceeds."" When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer (an ""Asset Sale Offer"") to all Holders of the Notes and, if required by the terms of any Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes (""Pari Passu Indebtedness""), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is in an amount equal to at least $2,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for the closing of such offer, and in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness at the offer price required by the terms thereof but not to exceed 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $200.0 million or less. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purposes not ----- otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall purchase the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Sale Offer using the proceeds from any Asset Sale at any time after the consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility, including under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees. Our future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuer becomes party may contain restrictions on the Issuer's ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.

If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of Total Assets under this covenant is being refinanced and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred under the applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar ----- denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor's Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is guaranteed by other obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee will have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the interests of the Holders of the Notes. The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to ----- receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) the Holders of at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing _Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder_ is not Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary, in any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and such beneficial owner shall provide proof of its holdings in a manner satisfactory to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation (“Litigation”) in a court of competent jurisdiction, attaching a copy of any related court filings, seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed or reinstituted pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter (a “Final _Decision”). Once such an Officer’s Certificate has been provided to the Trustee, the Trustee shall take no further action_ pursuant to the related Noteholder Direction until a Final Decision. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that such Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant (a “Verification Officer’s Certificate”), the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant, and the Trustee shall take no further action pursuant to the related Noteholder Direction until the Issuer provides a subsequent Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee that such Verification Covenant has been satisfied (a “Covenant Satisfaction Officer’s Certificate”). The Company shall promptly deliver a Covenant Satisfaction Officer's Certificate following satisfaction by the applicable Directing Holder of its Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of the Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or ----- otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action, staying any remedy or otherwise failing to act in accordance with a Noteholder Direction during the pendency of Litigation or a Noteholder Direction after a Verification Officer’s Certificate has been provided to it but prior to receipt of a Covenant Satisfaction Officer’s Certificate. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default and any actions taken to rectify such Default.",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

1756_1,Offerings 2021.md,239,"BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM",239.1,Depository Procedures,239.1.1,,"The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: ----- (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). Investors in 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee (or any of its agents) or any agent of the Issuer has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws and whether the investment is permitted under the terms of the applicable documents governing the Plan.",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing or holding the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. The sale of notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuer that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, a guarantor or any of their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan pays no more than “adequate consideration” in connection with the transaction. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance of these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any class exemption or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes, or that if an exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction. Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-United States plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such Plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing any notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and if necessary, the availability of, and exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws. ----- Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing plan assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,131

Total $ 1,500,000,000 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of these notes are purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated. The offering of the notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. We and the guarantors have agreed to indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The representative has advised us that the initial purchasers propose initially to offer the notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price or any other term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The initial purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The initial purchasers will not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions.” The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation system We have been ----- advised by certain of the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about       , 2021, which will be the    business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as ""T+   ""). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the second business day before the delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+  , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors. We have agreed that we will not, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 30 days after the date of this offering memorandum, without first obtaining the prior written consent of BofA Securities, Inc., directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities or securities exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities, except for the notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the purchase agreement. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, any purchases by the initial purchasers’ to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers makes any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers makes any representation that the representative will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.",N/A,as_expected,2021,131
