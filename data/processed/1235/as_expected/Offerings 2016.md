**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED APRIL 21, 2016**


**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL**

### $500,000,000


## PQ Corporation

### % Senior Secured Notes due 2022

PQ Corporation (“PQ”) is a leading integrated global innovator and manufacturer of specialty inorganic performance chemicals, specialty catalysts and

specialty glass materials.

We are issuing the notes in connection with the combination (the “Business Combination”) of PQ with Eco Services Operations LLC (“Eco”) and the

consummation of this offering is conditioned upon the concurrent closing of the Business Combination, the entering into of our new senior secured credit
facilities consisting of a New Term Loan Facility and a New ABL Facility, each as defined herein (the “New Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) and the
issuance of our new unsecured senior notes in a concurrent private placement (the “New Senior Unsecured Notes”). Eco is the leading producer of merchant
sulfuric acid in the United States.


Use of Proceeds: The net proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the proceeds from the

issuance of the New Senior Unsecured Notes and cash on hand, will be used to (i) repay Eco’s existing term loan facility (the “Eco Term Facility”) and any
amounts outstanding under Eco’s existing revolving credit facility (the “Eco Revolving Facility,” and together with the Eco Term Facility, the “Eco
Facilities”), (ii) repay PQ’s existing term loan facility (the “Existing PQ Term Facility”) and any amounts outstanding under PQ’s existing revolving credit
facility (the “Existing PQ Revolving Facility” and together with the Existing PQ Term Facility, the “Existing PQ Facilities”) and (iii) redeem all of PQ’s
existing 8.750% second lien senior secured notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes”).

The Notes will mature on, 2022 (a date that will be approximately six and one half years after the date the Notes are issued).


Interest Payments: The Notes will pay interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on and of each year, beginning on, 2016.


The Notes and the guarantees are secured, subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions by: (i) a first-priority security interest in substantially all of

our and the guarantors’ property and assets that secure our New Term Loan Facility (other than collateral securing our New ABL Facility on a first-priority
basis) and (ii) a second-priority security interest in receivables, inventory, deposit accounts and other collateral securing our New ABL Facility. The liens
securing the Notes and the guarantees are pari passu with the liens securing our New Term Loan Facility subject to the pari passu intercreditor agreement
and subordinated to the liens securing our New ABL Facility on a first-priority basis subject to the New ABL Facility intercreditor agreement.

The Notes will be initially guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by CPQ Midco I Corporation, the direct parent of PQ (“CPQ”),

PQ Holdings, the indirect parent of PQ (“PQ Holdings”) and each of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries in each case to the extent such entities are
guarantors under our New Term Loan Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

The Notes and guarantees thereof are our and the guarantors’ general senior secured indebtedness. They will rank equally in right of payment with all of

our and the guarantors’ existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness; effectively senior to all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future
unsubordinated indebtedness that is not secured, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Notes (including the $200 million in aggregate
principal amount of 8.5% Senior Notes due 2022, completed by Eco in October 2014 (the “2022 Notes”) and the New Senior Unsecured Notes); pari passu
with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness secured by a first priority lien on the collateral securing the Notes
(including the New Term Loan Facility); effectively subordinated to the New ABL Facility to the extent of the value of the assets securing the New ABL
Facility on a first priority basis; senior in right of payment to all of our and the guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to
all existing and future indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Ranking.”

The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after, 2019 on the redemption dates and at the redemption prices

specified under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” In addition, we may redeem up to 40% of the notes before, 2019 with the

net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings. We may also redeem some or all of the notes before, 2019 at a redemption price of 100% of the

principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a “make whole” premium. We may also be required to make
an offer to purchase the notes upon the sale of certain assets and upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control. In addition, if six months
prior to November 1, 2022 (i.e., the final stated maturity of the Existing Senior Notes), any of the Existing Senior Notes remain outstanding, the holders of
the Notes may require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase,
pursuant to an offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes—Special Mandatory Offer to Purchase.”

_Investing in the Notes involves risks that are described in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on page 30 of this offering memorandum._


**Offering Price:** **% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from** **, 2016.**


The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), as amended, or the securities laws of

any other jurisdiction. Unless they are registered, the Notes may be offered only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act, or
the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, we are offering the Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers
and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. For further details about eligible offerees and
resale restrictions, see “Notice to Investors.” We do not intend to make an offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or to
otherwise register the Notes for resale under the Securities Act.

**CAUTIONARY DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum, including the sections entitled “Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of PQ Holdings,” “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Eco,” and “Business” contains
forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this offering
memorandum, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business
strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,”
“may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should” and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our
current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our
financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short term and long term business operations and
objectives, and financial needs. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
statements we make regarding (i) our estimated results for the three months ended March 31, 2016, (ii) our
liquidity, including our belief that our current level of operations, our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from
operations and borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other lines of credit will provide
us adequate cash to fund the working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other requirements for our
business for the foreseeable future and (iii) the expected benefits of the Business Combination and estimated cost
savings. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
including those described in “Risk Factors.” Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing
environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor
can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we
may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances
discussed in this offering memorandum may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely
from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.

Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include:

   - risks related to our exposure to local business risks and regulations in different countries;

   - demand for our products being significantly affected by general economic conditions;

iii


-----

   - risks related to exchange rate fluctuations;

   - risks related to legal and regulatory compliance;

   - demand for our products being significantly affected by technological or other changes in our customers’

products;

   - risks related to our and our competitors’ research and development;

   - risks related to fluctuations in prices of raw materials and/or relationships with our key suppliers;

   - risks related to substantial competition;

   - risks related to our Eco business’ reliance on a small number of customers;

   - risks related to potential early termination or non-renewal in our Eco business’ contracts;

   - risks related to the seasonal fluctuations in demand for some of our products;

   - risks related to the retention of certain key personnel;

   - risks related to our expansion projects;

   - risks related to potential product liability claims;

   - risks related to existing and potential future government regulation;

   - risks related to the extensive environmental, health and safety regulations to which we are subject;

   - risks related to our insurance coverage;

   - risks related to our acquisition strategy;

   - risks related to our joint venture investments;

   - risks related to our failure to protect our intellectual property and infringement on the intellectual property

rights of third parties;

   - risks related to potential labor disruptions;

   - risks related to litigation and other administrative and regulatory proceedings;

   - our inability to realize the expected benefits of the Business Combination, including anticipated synergies

and cost savings;

   - risks related to our substantial indebtedness; and

   - other factors that are described in “Risk Factors.”

The forward-looking statements included in this offering memorandum are made only as of the date hereof.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that
the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future
results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements
will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and
completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this offering memorandum to conform these
statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.

You should read this offering memorandum with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of

activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

business. In addition, our name, logo and website name and address are our service marks or trademarks. Each
trademark, trade name or service mark by any other company appearing in this offering memorandum belongs to
its holder. Some of the more important trade names and trademarks that we use include Potters, PQ, Zeolyst and

**SUPPLY SHARE AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION**

The data regarding our supply share of product end-uses and other statistical information used throughout

this offering memorandum are based on independent industry publications, reports by research firms or other
published independent sources. Some data and statistical information are also based on our good faith estimates,
which are derived from management’s knowledge of our industry and such independent sources referred to
above. Certain supply share statistics, ranking and industry data included in this offering memorandum, including
the size of certain end-uses and our size or estimated position and the positions of our competitors for sales into
such end-uses, including our services relative to our competitors, are based on estimates of our management.
These estimates have been derived from our management’s knowledge and experience in the industries in which
we operate, as well as information obtained from surveys, reports by research firms, our customers, distributors,
suppliers, trade and business organizations and other contacts in the industries in which we operate. Unless
otherwise noted, all of our supply share and supply position information presented in this offering memorandum
is an approximation based on management’s knowledge. Our supply share and supply position in each of our
businesses and product groups, unless otherwise noted, is based on our sales volumes relative to the estimated
sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 in the end-uses we serve over the same period. References
herein to our being a leader in a supply position or product category refer to our belief that we have a leading
supply share position in each specified end-use, unless the context otherwise requires. In addition, the discussion
herein regarding our various end-uses is based on how we define the end-uses for our products, which products
may be either part of larger overall sources of demand or sources of demand that include other types of products
and services.

Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this offering memorandum have been

subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables or charts may not be the
arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not
total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that
precede them.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**The Business Combination**

On August 17, 2015, we, PQ Holdings, the parent company of PQ, Eco, Eco Services Holdings LLC, Eco

Services Group Holdings LLC (“Group Holdings”) and certain entities controlled by CCMP Capital Advisors,
LLC (“CCMP”) entered into a reorganization and transaction agreement (as subsequently amended, the
“Reorganization Agreement”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, we agreed

v


-----

to consummate a series of transactions to reorganize and combine the businesses of PQ and Eco under a new
holding company, PQ Group Holdings Inc. (“New Holdings”). The Business Combination is more fully
described below under “Summary—The Business Combination.”

**Historical Financial Information**

The financial information of PQ Holdings and Eco contained in this offering memorandum have been

prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP” or “U.S.
GAAP”). In accordance with U.S. GAAP, this offering memorandum presents Eco as the accounting predecessor
to New Holdings.

Until the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit by Eco (the

“2014 Acquisition”), Eco historically operated as a business unit of Solvay USA Inc. (“Solvay”) and therefore,
the financial statements of Eco contained in this offering memorandum for periods prior to the 2014 Acquisition
are not necessarily indicative of what Eco’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have
been if Eco had been a separate, standalone entity that operated completely independently of Solvay.
Additionally, in connection with the 2014 Acquisition, a new basis of accounting was established as of
December 1, 2014 as a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, with
respect to the historical financial and related information of Eco included in this offering memorandum following
such date, references to “Predecessor” refer to periods prior to such date and references to “Successor” refer to
periods after such date.

**Pro Forma Financial and Other Data**

We present in this offering memorandum certain unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial and

other data on an as adjusted basis to give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the related financing
transactions. The pro forma combined financial information included in this offering memorandum, and the
phrase “on a pro forma basis,” give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the related financing
transactions as if they had occurred on (i) December 31, 2015 for balance sheet purposes and (ii) January 1, 2015
for statement of income purposes. See “Summary— Summary Historical Financial and Other Data,”
“Capitalization” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.” The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial and other data is presented for informational purposes only, is based on
currently available information and is not indicative of our financial position or results of operations that would
have occurred had the pro forma transactions taken place on the applicable dates, nor is it necessarily indicative
of future results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial and other data has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, GAAP or any other generally accepted
accounting standards.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in other public disclosures of

“non-GAAP financial measures.” These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial measures are
publicly presented and require, among other things:

   - a presentation of equal or greater prominence of the most directly comparable financial measure or

measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP;

   - a quantitative reconciliation for historical non-GAAP measures presented and qualitative differences

between non-GAAP financial measures disclosed with the most directly comparable financial measure
calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP;

vi


-----

   - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the registrant’s management uses the non-GAAP financial

measure; and

   - a statement disclosing the reasons why the registrant’s management believes that presentation of the non
GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding the registrant’s financial
condition and results of operations.

The rules prohibit in all filings with the SEC, among other things:

   - the exclusion of charges or liabilities that require, or will require, cash settlement or would have required

cash settlement, absent an ability to settle in another manner, from a non-GAAP liquidity measure;

   - the adjustment of a non-GAAP financial measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring,

infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it has occurred in the past two
years or is reasonably likely to recur within the next two years, where such charge is specifically described
as non-recurring;

   - the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of the registrant’s financial statements

prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or in the accompanying notes;

   - the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of any pro forma financial information

required to be disclosed by Article 11 of Regulation S-X; or

   - the use of titles or descriptions of non-GAAP financial measures that are the same as, or confusingly

similar to, titles or descriptions used for GAAP financial measures.

To supplement the financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use certain non
GAAP financial measures of PQ Holdings and Eco in this offering memorandum such as (i) “Adjusted
EBITDA,” “Combined Adjusted EBITDA,” “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA” and “Business Adjusted
EBITDA” (collectively, our “EBITDA Measures”) and (ii) “Free Cash Flow.” In addition, we present (i)
“Contribution Margin” and (ii) “Fixed Costs” for Eco. We also present combined financial data for Eco for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2014. The combined financial data for Eco for the year ended
December 31, 2011 is the combination of the predecessor period from January 1, 2011 to September 6, 2011 and
the successor period from September 7, 2011 to December 31, 2011 for the Solvay acquisition from Rhodia of
the Eco business. The combined financial data for Eco for the year ended December 31, 2014 is the combination
of the predecessor period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014 and the successor period from inception
(July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014 for the CCMP acquisition from Solvay of the Eco business. We also
present combined financial data for PQ as the combined results for PQ Holdings Inc. and the Eco Services
Operations LLC. Our presentation of our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow, Contribution Margin and
Fixed Costs may not comply with SEC rules governing the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. For
example, some of the adjustments to our EBITDA Measures as presented in this offering memorandum may not
be allowed under Regulation S-X. We have included our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow in this offering
memorandum because our management believes that they provide useful information about our past operating
performance. Our presentation of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with the definitions of
EBITDA included in the indenture governing the Notes offered hereby, the New Senior Unsecured Notes and our
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Our EBITDA
Measures and Free Cash Flow are not measurements of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should
not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not
consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results under GAAP. Some of these
limitations include:

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest,

or principal payments, on our debt;

vii


-----

   - they exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash availability to us;

   - although depreciation is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated will often have to be replaced in

the future, and our EBITDA Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, which
includes maintenance capital expenditures;

   - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash

flows; and

   - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their

usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as

measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these
limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow only
for supplemental purposes. See our financial statements elsewhere in this offering memorandum for our GAAP
results. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data
of PQ Holdings” and “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of Eco” for a description of the calculation of
Adjusted EBITDA of each of PQ and Eco, Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA, a reconciliation to net income (loss) and a description of Free Cash Flow. The adjustments that are
used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA for PQ are not allocated to PQ’s operating businesses and, as a result, we are
unable to reconcile Business Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure. Total Business Adjusted EBITDA
differs from PQ’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA because it does not include the impact of unallocated
corporate expenses as reflected in “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of PQ Holdings.” See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Eco—Description of Key Financial
Statement Line Items” for a description of Contribution Margin and Fixed Costs.

**Our Businesses**

**_Performance Chemicals_**

Our Performance Chemicals business is an integrated silicate technology producer with leading supply

positions in North America, Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific. Our Performance Chemicals business
produces inorganic products in six main categories: (i) Sodium Silicate, (ii) Specialty Silicas, (iii) Zeolite
Products, (iv) Spray Dry Silicates, (v) Magnesium Silicate and (vi) Other Specialty Chemicals. Our silicate
products and solutions and derivative products are used in a variety of end-uses such as adsorbents for surface
coatings, clarifying agents for beverages, cleaning and personal care products. From 2005 to 2015, our
Performance Chemicals business achieved a 5.4% sales CAGR and an 8.6% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR; our
ability to grow throughout economic cycles was driven by the diverse consumer and industrial end-uses for our
products, our local relationships and the global scale of our business. Our products are essential building blocks
that impart critical performance characteristics in our customers’ end-products, yet typically represent a small
portion of our customers’ overall end-product costs. Further, our cost structure and strategically located
manufacturing facility network is a key competitive strength as many of our products have a very limited
economic shipping distance.

We are a global player and we believe we have leading supply positions across our portfolio of products.

We expect favorable industry and competitive conditions to continue as a result of the attractive,
environmentally-friendly attributes of silicates, large investment required to build new production capacity, the
lack of cost-effective substitute chemicals for sodium silicate and the low penetration of imported sodium silicate
due to significant transportation costs and our short delivery cycle times.

**_Catalysts_**

Our Catalysts business is an integrated silica catalyst and specialty zeolite-based catalyst producer with

leading North America supply positions. Our Catalysts business is managed through two reporting business units:
Silica Catalysts product group and Catalyst joint ventures. In our Silica Catalysts product group, the majority of
products that we sell are used in the production of high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”), a high strength and high
stiffness polyethylene used in demanding applications such as large-part blow molding, film and pipes. In our
Catalyst joint ventures, we produce specialty zeolite-based catalysts that are sold to the emissions control
industry, the petrochemical industry and other areas of the broader chemicals industry. We have achieved an
12.9% sales CAGR and a 13.6% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR in our Catalysts business from 2005 to 2015,
throughout economic cycles, driven by our highly innovative products providing critical functionality and our
leading industry positions and broad customer reach. We believe that our products are mission critical for
multiple industries and impart vital functionality in the production of chemicals and basic materials and the
reduction of emissions in engines. Our Catalysts business maintains a highly technological and customized
product offering with development times routinely ranging from five to ten years, a versatile product structure
that allows for continued innovation and customization, and an alignment with industry leading customers in
attractive end-uses. The Silica Catalysts Product Group is also leveraging its technical expertise to develop new
catalyst products for other end-uses involving new and more efficient pathways for producing industrial
chemicals, including methyl methacrylate (“MMA”) and ethyl acetate.

**_Specialty Glass Materials_**

Our Specialty Glass Materials business is the industry leader in North America and is comprised of the

Highway Safety and Engineered Glass Materials (“EGM”) product groups. Highway Safety manufactures glass
beads used for airport, highway and road safety applications to improve visibility in wet and nighttime driving
conditions. These beads are primarily sold to state municipalities, highway contractors and paint / thermoplastic
producers under the Potters brand. Engineered Glass Materials produces solid and hollow glass spheres for use as


4


-----

polymer additives and fillers in specialized plastics, as engineered peening beads in metal finishing and as
conductives in consumer electronics and other applications. We have achieved a 3.1% sales CAGR and a 3.9%
Adjusted EBITDA CAGR in our Specialty Glass Materials business from 2005 to 2015, in spite of economic
downturns, driven by our diverse consumer and industrial end-uses and our ability to innovate and drive product
and service differentiation in our core business. Our superior customer service, in combination with strong, longterm relationships that have fostered close technical collaboration, along with our global footprint and technical
capabilities, provide our Specialty Glass Materials business with a distinct competitive advantage.

**_Eco_**

Our Eco business is an integrated merchant sulfuric acid producer with the number one supply share

position in the United States in both sulfuric acid regeneration and the production of virgin sulfuric acid for
merchant sale. Eco operates through two principal product groups: Sulfuric Acid Regeneration and Virgin
Sulfuric Acid. Our Sulfuric Acid Regeneration business recycles spent sulfuric acid into fresh sulfuric acid for
continuous supply to the oil refining industry. Refineries utilize sulfuric acid as the primary catalyst in the
alkylation process which produces high octane gasoline blending additives. Our Virgin Sulfuric Acid business
produces high quality virgin acid products from sulfur and other raw materials for supply to a wide range of
industrial end-users who purchase these products in the United States. There are a variety of end-users who
purchase sulfuric acid products including the nylon, mining, general industrial and chemicals industries.

We have achieved a 4.1% sales CAGR and a 3.2% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR from 2005 to 2015 in our Eco

business. Our ability to grow throughout economic cycles was driven by our industry-leading integrated product
and service offering and the critical, non-discretionary nature of our product. We believe we operate in an
industry with attractive fundamentals and significant capital costs associated with new sulfuric acid plants. Our
integrated network of plants and logistics assets, which are integrated into our customers’ supply chains, are
difficult to replicate and provides us with a significant competitive advantage and deeply entrenched customer
relationships. We have established our leading supply share position for merchant sulfuric acid sales through a
long and continuous operating history and the consistent delivery to our customers via integration into their
supply chains. Our core operating value of “absolute reliability” reflects the critical, non-discretionary aspect of
sulfuric acid usage from the perspective of our customers, who generally cannot operate without consuming
sulfuric acid on a continuous basis.

**Industry Overview**

We are a global producer of inorganic specialty chemicals, materials and catalysts with leading supply

positions across our portfolio. We operate through four principal businesses—Performance Chemicals, Catalysts,
Specialty Glass Materials and Eco—that offer a broad set of product groups serving diverse end-uses and
geographies.

We are an integrated producer throughout the silicates, catalysts and engineered glass products supply chain and

the only major producer of both sodium silicates and engineered glass materials producing in each of the key
geographic regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. We are a global player across all of our
product lines. Our highly-efficient network of plants is closely aligned with our key customers and provides us with a
strong competitive position, as silicate plants are generally spread out locally with a few larger dedicated units for
derivative production. Our Specialty Glass Materials facilities are also strategically positioned in close proximity to our
customers, a competitive advantage in an industry where the ability to provide products “on-demand” is critical; our
extensive manufacturing footprint and close proximity to customers allow us to respond quickly to demand resulting
from unfavorable weather conditions or for short-lead time road development projects.

Our Eco business holds the number one supply share position in the United States in both sulfuric acid

regeneration and the production of virgin sulfuric acid for merchant sales. Our network of facilities is
concentrated in the major areas of sulfuric acid demand in the United States. These plants are located close to
major U.S. refining customers and integrated through well-established supply chain networks, including in some
cases captive pipelines connecting us to our oil refining customers.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

The following competitive strengths reinforce our industry leadership positions, contribute to our ability to

generate what we believe are industry leading profit margins, support our innovation efforts and are expected to
drive our ability to continue generating strong free cash flow in the future:

   - Leading supply share positions. We believe that we maintain a leading supply share position in each of

our major product lines, holding what we estimate to be number one or two supply share position for the
year ended December 31, 2015 for more than 90% of the products we produce, based on volume, in North
America, EMEA or Asia, as applicable, where the respective products are sold. Our supply share position
is driven by our technical service and product leadership, our scale and our ability to efficiently serve our
customers globally through our broad network of strategically located manufacturing facilities. In
addition, our close proximity to many of our customers enhances our integration within their business
processes and our ability to address supply chain needs with on time delivery. Across all of our
businesses, we have achieved and maintained leading supply share positions by developing strong
relationships with key customers and demonstrating the technical excellence and differentiated
performance of our products. We believe these positions allow us to drive growth through continued
innovation in our key products and have allowed us to outperform the industry, as a whole, in recessionary
environments.

   - Attractive industry structure. We hold leading positions in attractive industries, with strategically
located, cost-effective plants and long-term customer relationships, which, in combination, provide
favorable industry dynamics. Attractive underlying fundamentals including localized product demand and
a competitive advantage have allowed us to maintain margins throughout business and economic cycles.
In our Performance Chemicals and Specialty Glass Materials businesses, many of our competitors are
local or regional players. We believe that we have distinct cost advantages versus our competitors in these
businesses, and we benefit from our strategically located manufacturing facilities due to the high cost of
transportation relative to silicate and glass materials prices. Our geographic footprint is closely aligned


8


-----

with our key customers, which we believe provides us with a strong competitive position. In Performance
Chemicals, we believe that we also benefit from having manufacturing operations that target specific high
margin niche products. In Specialty Glass materials, we contract on an annual basis, which allows for
management of input costs and hedging of fuel needs. In our Catalysts business, we collaborate with our
customers over many years to develop products that meet customized specifications and performance
characteristics with strict quality and specification standards. In addition, we protect our technological and
process innovations through our extensive portfolio of patents and through our trade secret protection
program. While no one patent is crucial to our continued success, we believe our patent portfolio in the
aggregate, combined with our extensive manufacturing network, reinforces our competitive advantage. In
Eco, our regeneration business is highly integrated into our customers’ sulfuric acid regeneration and
supply activities, in some cases via captive pipeline connections. A significant portion of Performance
Chemicals North America and Eco revenue is protected through long term contracts, some of which are
“take or pay,” with cost pass-throughs. Additionally, we believe that there are attractive macro
fundamentals underpinning each of our four divisions. Performance Chemicals is aided by shifting
customer preferences towards greener substitutes for personal care, household cleaning, and tire
applications. Our Catalysts business is aided by the industrial buildout in petrochemicals and increased
focus on emission control. Our Specialty Glass Materials business is aided by increasing highway safety
regulations. We believe Eco is underpinned by growing sulfuric acid needs as a result of well-positioned
North American refining customers and increased demand for high octane gasoline and increased
alkylation from higher mix of tight/shale oil.

- Attractive, stable margins with near term synergy and cost savings upside. We have demonstrated our

ability to maintain stable margins while continuously growing the business organically in different
macroeconomic environments. From 2008 through 2015, PQ’s Adjusted EBITDA margins and
contribution margins (which refer to sales less variable costs excluding freight costs, divided by sales)
averaged 22% and 55%, respectively, and did not vary significantly over that period. From 2008 through
2015, Eco’s Adjusted EBITDA margins and contribution margins averaged 22% and 66%, respectively,
and did not vary significantly over that period. Unlike many chemical companies that use oil-based
materials as a feedstock, our products rely on inorganic inputs, which makes us less sensitive to the
volatility associated with oil-related commodity prices. In addition, we have long-term relationships with
our key raw materials suppliers across our businesses and our customers and have been able to mitigate
the impact of raw material or energy prices using a variety of mechanisms, including hedging on a
monthly basis and pass-through on a quarterly basis or adjustment provisions in our sales contracts. For
the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 45% of our North American Performance Chemicals
sales and approximately 91% of Eco Sulfuric Acid sales were derived from pass-through contracts. We
have also been able to favorably negotiate other terms to compensate for material increases in key inputs.
This combination of differentiated products and pass-through contracts has allowed us to sustain attractive
margins. Moreover, exposure to defensive industries such as personal care, cleaning products, tires, and
gasoline creates greater volume stability in downturns. We have identified $21.7 million in synergies and
gross cost savings opportunities the majority of which are related to the integration of Eco Services into
our operations. We believe that we maintain a differentiated level of stability in margins and cash flow in
the specialty chemical sector.

- Global and diverse end-uses. We serve a broad range of end-uses worldwide with no single end-use

representing more than 18% of pro forma combined sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our
Performance Chemicals, Catalysts and Specialty Glass Materials businesses benefit from global trends
such as the growing global middle class, increased environmental regulations for emissions reduction and
rising global energy consumption. Many of our largest end-uses, including transportation safety, laundry
detergents, consumer cleaning, food and beverage and personal care, exhibit a low degree of cyclicality.
The diversity of our remaining end-uses mitigates the impact of any one industry or regional cycle on our
business. Our Eco business is benefitting from historically higher shale oil production in the United States


9


-----

and regulatory trends. Sulfuric acid serves as a key catalyst for refineries in the production of alkylate,
which is considered to be the best blending component for gasoline because of its superior ability to boost
octane and its low vapor pressure relative to substitutes such as ethanol and butane. For the year ended
December 31, 2015, we generated approximately 68% of our pro forma combined sales in North America,
22% in Europe, 5% in Asia, 3% in South America and 2% in the rest of the world. In addition, we have
benefited from the global trend toward more environmentally-friendly chemical solutions due to the
inorganic nature of our products. The displacement of less environmentally-friendly chemicals in some
applications will continue to drive higher growth rates as environmental concerns grow in magnitude and
create opportunities for us to provide value-added solutions in these areas.

- Long-term relationships with a diverse set of high-quality customers. We have cultivated a diversified

and loyal base of customers, many of which are leading companies in their respective industries. Our
customers include AkzoNobel, Albemarle, Anheuser-Busch InBev, BASF, Chevron, Colgate-Palmolive,
Dow Chemical, Evonik, ExxonMobil, GlaxoSmithKline, Halliburton, Henkel, Honeywell, INEOS Group,
Johnson Matthey, LyondellBasell, Procter & Gamble, Rio Tinto, SAB Miller, SABIC, Schlumberger,
Sherwin-Williams, Umicore, Unilever, W. R. Grace and 3M. The average length of our relationships with
our top 10 customers is over 50 years. Additionally, we have a diversified customer base, with our top 10
customers representing approximately 25% of pro forma combined sales for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and no single customer representing more than 4% of pro forma combined sales for
that period. We collaborate with our customers over many years to develop products that meet customized
specifications and performance characteristics with strict quality standards. The long lead-time for product
development—between five and ten years in some cases—provides an excellent opportunity for our
company to build deep working relationships with customers. We believe our proximity to customers
provides distinct cost advantages and a competitive advantage given the high cost of transportation
relative to silicate and glass material prices. Given that our products provide critical performance
functions in the end-products for which they are used, yet typically represent a very small portion of the
overall cost of such end-products, our key customers depend on us for continual supply of our products
over a prolonged period of time.

- Proven ability to develop and commercialize new products. We leverage our state-of-the-art product

development and commercialization platform to develop novel and highly customized products to meet
evolving customer demand in the key regions around the world. We believe that our ability to collaborate
closely with our customers to formulate innovative manufacturing and product solutions allows us to
better serve them and is a key competitive advantage. For example, in our Performance Chemicals
business, we have recently worked with our global European-based customers to optimize our
manufacturing process to provide products for high whitening and desensitizing toothpaste applications
that meet their particular specifications. We have also recently developed a new, environmentallyfriendly, magnesium-silicate product that allows restaurants to clean and recycle oil used for frying food.
As a result of our new product development and commercialization efforts, we estimate that we generated
over $173 million of pro forma combined sales in the year ended December 31, 2015 from products or
applications that have been developed or commercialized in the last five years. Moreover, since 2009,
sales margins have improved in more than 78% of our product lines. Overall, our product mix has become
more focused on specialty, high-value added customer solutions.

- Cash generative business model. Our business model is focused on high return capital projects with

rapid payback periods. From 2011 through 2015, PQ invested $255 million of growth project capital with
an estimated three- to four-year payback. During this period, PQ realized approximately $48 million of
Adjusted EBITDA growth with additional projected Adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 and 2017 from
these projects still to be realized with minimal spending. From 2011 to 2015, PQ invested $31 million on
cost improvement projects with an estimated two- to three-year payback. From 2008 to 2009, PQ
integrated INEOS Silicas and realized certain synergy benefits, increasing the margins for this business


10


-----

from 12.3% before its acquisition in 2007 to 21.3% after its acquisition in 2009. We believe the relatively
fast payback period on these benefits positions us to be prepared during shifting marketing environments.
PQ has tax attributes that mainly consist of $288 million in U.S. federal net operating losses, along with
correlative state net operating losses, and $460 million identified intangibles and goodwill from the 2014
Acquisition, both of which will generate cash tax savings in future years.

  - Experienced management team. Our senior management team has substantial industry experience,

proven capabilities and an average of over 30 years of experience in the performance chemicals, catalysts,
specialty glass materials or sulfuric acid industries. Their industry experience extends to a broad range of
facets of these industries, including acquisition integration, strategic management, manufacturing, sales
and marketing, new product and applications development and financial management. Our management
team was able to effectively guide PQ through the most recent recession by focusing on pricing actions,
cost management, new product introductions and revising product offerings in order to shift towards more
profitable and high growth end-uses. Our senior management team has a significant equity ownership
interest in our company (approximately 10% of outstanding shares of New Holdings on a pro forma basis
for the Business Combination).

**Our Business Strategy**

Our long-term success will be driven by our competitive strengths that will support our business strategy to

continue to expand our product offering with higher margin innovative products. The key elements of our
strategy are as follows:

   - Continue to focus our development efforts on high margin products. We intend to maintain our

position as a leading, integrated producer of silicate and glass materials. We plan to do this, in part, by
capitalizing on our technological leadership positions and our proven research and development
competencies by developing new products, applications and end-uses for our silicate-based chemicals,
specialty catalysts, engineered glass materials, and sulfuric acid platforms. Across our businesses, we have
a proven track record of commercializing new products. This capability has diversified our product mix
away from lower-margin, lower-growth products such as zeolites for detergent end-uses and into highermargin, higher-growth products such as magnesium silicate for frying oils, silica gels for coating
applications and hollow glass spheres for emulsions for mining and auto body putty. For example, we
have developed precipitated silica products for use in high whitening and desensitizing toothpaste and are
developing new applications we hope to commercialize in the near future. We believe pursuing such
opportunities will continue to result in profitable growth as we leverage our technological know-how and
existing asset base developed from our core product lines. In addition, our new product development
efforts are focused on applications with expected contribution margins greater than 50%.

We have developed an industry-leading Catalysts business that has more than tripled its Adjusted
EBITDA since 2005 and has achieved an average Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 37% over
the same time period. This growth has been achieved through development of our proprietary technology,
and we have made over $200 million in investments since 2005 to expand our manufacturing and
technical capabilities and to increase capacity. In advance of committing to capital investments, we have
been able to secure sole-source supply arrangements or have entered into long-term contracts with
contracted volumes across both silica and specialty zeolite-based catalysts, and we expect our percentage
of sales under long-term contracts to increase in the future. We expect to achieve high margins on sales
from products related to these capital investments and to commit relatively low ongoing maintenance
capital expenditures. We expect to achieve an approximately two-year payback, from the date those assets
are placed in service, on the projects for which we have committed capital, and we expect to commit
additional capital to serve newly contracted customers.


11


-----

As we continue to improve our technological advantage and our ability to serve our customers, we expect
to continue to achieve high-return growth in this business line. Our products offer essential functional
properties and are tailored to meet specific customer requirements, but represent a relatively low
percentage of our customers’ manufacturing costs. We believe that our products help our customers to
manufacture their products more cost-effectively and with better performance characteristics than
competing technologies. For example, we believe our silica-based catalysts have continued to win
opportunities in both new and existing polymerization and engineered plastics applications due to these
characteristics.

We believe that our specialty zeolite-based catalyst products and the end-uses they serve are well-aligned
with several favorable global trends. The largest business in our specialty zeolite-based catalyst platform
serves emissions control applications, particularly in the transportation industry, and we are strategically
aligned with the top specialty zeolite-based catalysts producers in emissions control technologies. We
believe the tightening of global emissions control standards has driven a reformulation of Heavy-Duty
Diesel (“HDD”) engine catalysts, which relies on SCR, a zeolite-based catalytic process. In addition, we
sell hydrocracking catalysts and Y-Powder zeolite material, which is a key component of critical
hydrocracking catalysts; our joint venture partner, CRI Zeolites Inc. (a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell
plc), is a leader in hydrocracking catalytic processes technology. Approximately 61% of the specialty
zeolite-based catalyst sales during the year ended December 31, 2015 in these product lines were related
to products that are protected by patents or sole-sourced.

- Drive efficiency and cost savings. We intend to enhance our business processes and pursue cost savings

opportunities available to us, especially in our Eco business. We will continue to pursue manufacturing
efficiency gains through a number of initiatives already underway including lean manufacturing, investing
in high return capital projects, and optimizing capacity to leverage our fixed cost base. We have identified
$21.7 million in synergies and gross cost savings opportunities the majority of which are related to the
integration of Eco Services into our operations. We may not realize these expected cost savings, see “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Business Combination—We may not realize the expected benefits of the
Business Combination because of integration difficulties and other challenges” and “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Business Combination—We may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings or may incur
additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them.”

- Focus on cash flow generation and debt reduction. We intend to continue to seek growth in our high

margin products, while managing our costs and taking a disciplined approach to capital spending and
working capital control. We have historically achieved cost savings through continuous improvement,
yield enhancement, and energy improvement initiatives and expect to continue to do so. We have also
invested capital and expect to continue to do so in order to achieve cost savings and support our existing
high quality fixed assets and customers. We will also seek to grow our assets and customer base on a
targeted basis to achieve compelling returns. We otherwise intend to use our excess cash flow to reduce
our outstanding indebtedness.

**Recent Developments**

Each of PQ and Eco are in the process of finalizing their results of operations and other financial data for the

three months ended March 31, 2016. While our full financial results for such period are not available,
management currently estimates as follows:

   - As of March 31, 2016 on a pro forma basis for the Business Combination, the combined company had

cash on hand of approximately $79 million and approximately $17 million outstanding in the aggregate
under the Existing PQ Revolving Facility and the Eco Revolving Facility for seasonal working capital
requirements.

   - On a pro forma basis, the combined company’s first quarter 2016 sales are expected to decrease slightly

from the first quarter of 2015 while the combined company’s first quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA is
expected to be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2015.

   - PQ’s stand-alone sales for the first quarter of 2016 are expected to be lower compared to the first quarter

of 2015, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.

   - Eco’s stand-alone sales for the first quarter of 2016 are expected to be higher compared to the first quarter

of 2015, primarily due to increased sales volumes in its sulfuric acid regeneration business.

   - Eco is accruing approximately $3 million in additional severance cost for the reduction in workforce

related to anticipated cost savings in connection with the Business Combination.

The estimated financial results presented in this section are preliminary, unaudited and subject to the

completion of PQ’s and Eco’s financial closing procedures for the three months ended March 31, 2016 for each
of Eco and PQ. Those procedures have not yet been completed, and the estimated financial results should not be
viewed as a substitute for full quarterly financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and
reviewed or audited by the independent accountants for PQ or Eco. Estimates of results are inherently uncertain
and subject to change, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. Actual results remain subject
to the completion of management’s and the audit committee’s final review, as well as review by the independent
accountants.

There can be no assurances that the actual financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 will

be identical to the estimates set forth herein and any variation may be material. The preliminary financial data
included in this offering memorandum has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to
the accompanying preliminary financial data. Accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an
opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. See “Cautionary Disclosure Regarding ForwardLooking Statements.”

**The Business Combination**

The purpose of the Reorganization Agreement is to implement the Business Combination through a series of

steps including (i) the merger of Merger Sub with and into PQ Holdings, with PQ Holdings surviving the merger
and becoming a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of New Holdings, (ii) the merger of Group Holdings Merger
Sub LLC with and into Group Holdings, with Group Holdings surviving the merger and becoming a direct,
wholly-owned subsidiary of New Holdings, (iii) the merger of Group Holdings with and into New Holdings, with
New Holdings surviving the merger, (iv) the merger of Eco Holdings with and into PQ Holdings, with PQ
Holdings surviving the merger, (v) the merger of Eco with and into PQ Corp, with PQ Corp surviving the merger
and (vi) the drop down of the assets comprising the Eco business into Eco Services Operations Corp., a wholly
owned subsidiary of PQ Corporation. As a result of these transactions, New Holdings will become the indirect
holder of all of the issued and outstanding equity of PQ Holdings.

**Our Principal Stockholders**

In December 2014, affiliates of CCMP completed the acquisition of an approximate 49% equity interest in

PQ Holdings, Inc. INEOS Investments Partnership (“INEOS”) and members of PQ management own the
remaining 51% equity interest in PQ Holdings, Inc. Also in December 2014, affiliates of CCMP acquired an
approximate 95% equity interest in Eco Services Group Holdings LLC, the indirect parent of Eco Services
Operations LLC, with members of Eco’s management holding the remaining 5% equity interest in Eco Services
Group Holdings LLC. After the consummation of the Business Combination, affiliates of CCMP, INEOS and
members of management and our board of directors will own approximately 59%, 31%, and 10%, respectively,
of New Holdings, the direct parent of PQ Holdings as of the closing of the Business Combination.

CCMP is a leading global private equity firm specializing in buyouts and growth equity investments in

companies ranging from $250 million to more than $3 billion in assets. CCMP’s founders have invested over $16
billion since 1984, which includes their activities at J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC (a private equity division of
JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and its predecessor firms. CCMP was formed in August 2006 when the buyout and
growth equity investment professionals of J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC separated from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to
commence operations as an independent firm. The foundation of CCMP’s investment approach is to leverage the
combined strengths of its deep industry expertise and proprietary operating resources to create value by investing
in four targeted industries—Industrials, Energy/Chemicals, Consumer/Retail and Healthcare.

INEOS is affiliated with the INEOS Group, one of the world’s leading chemical companies and a global

manufacturer of petrochemicals, specialty chemicals and oil products. The INEOS Group’s business has highly
integrated, world-class chemical facilities and production technologies. As of December 15, 2015, the INEOS

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED**

**COMBINED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

The following tables set forth certain unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial and other data for

the year ended December 31, 2015. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data set
forth below should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of PQ Holdings,” “Selected
Consolidated Financial Data of Eco,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations of PQ Holdings,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations of Eco” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto of each of
PQ Holdings and Eco, each of which is included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In accordance with
U.S. GAAP, Eco is the accounting predecessor to New Holdings.

The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data presented below have been derived

from the historical consolidated financial statements of PQ Holdings and Eco included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum using the acquisition method of accounting and give effect to the Business Combination and the
related financing transactions in each case, as if they had occurred on December 31, 2015 for purposes of the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data and as of January 1, 2015 for purposes of the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income, as more fully described in the assumptions and
adjustments set forth under the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Statements.” The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data is presented for informational
purposes only, is based on currently available information and is not necessarily indicative of our financial
position or results of operations that would have occurred had the pro forma transactions taken place on the
applicable dates, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflecting the Business Combination and related refinancing

transactions will be based upon the acquisition method of accounting and upon the assumptions set forth in the
Notes included in this section and in “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.” The
unaudited pro forma adjustments and allocation of the excess acquisition purchase price over the tangible and
intangible net assets acquired to intangible assets and goodwill are preliminary and based on management’s best
estimate of the fair value of intangible assets acquired relating to the Business Combination. The final purchase
price allocation for the Business Combination is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of asset and
liability valuations. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not completed the valuation studies
necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the
purchase price for the Business Combination. We have allocated the total estimated purchase price for the
Business Combination, calculated as described in Note 1 under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Statements” to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of their fair
values. In arriving at the estimated fair market values, we have considered many factors, including but not
limited to, the appraisals by independent consultants which were based on a preliminary and limited review of
the assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed. There are no assurances that the final estimate of fair
market values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will not be materially different from the estimated
fair market values thereof once a more detailed and thorough review of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is
performed. The final valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets that exist as of the
closing date of the Business Combination. Final adjustments relating to the Business Combination will change
the allocations of purchase price, which will affect the fair value assigned to certain assets acquired and liabilities
assumed and will result in a change to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements,
including a change to goodwill. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and
the differences may be material.

closings and consolidation, relocation or integration costs and other non-recurring business
optimization and restructuring charges of approximately $4.5 million for PQ and approximately

(h) Represents costs under a transition services agreement with Solvay which provides certain transition
services to Eco by Solvay following the 2014 Acquisition. The transition services agreement ended in
2015. Certain services under this agreement will be incurred internally and reflected as an operating
expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

(i) Represents the Catalyst joint ventures depreciation, amortization and interest expense.

(j) Relates primarily to environmental related costs of $2.0 million, defined benefit periodic pension costs
of $6.1 million, other transaction gains of foreign currency in the income statement of $2.7 million and
Sarbanes-Oxley preparation fees of $1.0 million as well as non-cash LIFO adjustment and expense,
non-recurring legal-related costs, capital taxes, asset retirement obligation accretion and other expense.

(k) Represents estimated identified run-rate synergies and cost savings opportunities, including (i) Eco
overhead savings of $4.4 million resulting from consolidation synergies, insurance savings and SG&A
savings, (ii) Eco manufacturing improvements of $8.1 million resulting from cost improvements,
higher labor productivity and lower fixed freight costs and (iii) PQ cost reductions of $9.2 million
resulting from ongoing fixed and variable cost programs and other programs already in progress or
approved by PQ’s board of directors.

(3) Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA margin is Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA divided by pro
forma sales plus PQ Holdings’ proportionate share of the Catalyst Joint Venture sales.

and differs from interest expense in the income statement which includes amortization of deferred financing
fees. Pro forma cash interest expense assumes a weighted average interest rate for the New Term Loan
Facility, the New Senior Unsecured Notes, the existing Eco Notes and Notes offered hereby of
approximately 8.2%. For every 0.125% change in the assumed weighted average interest rate for the New
Term Loan Facility and the Notes offered hereby, assuming the New ABL Facility is undrawn, pro forma
cash interest expense would increase or decrease, as applicable, by $2.3 million.

(7) Ratio of pro forma net secured total debt to Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA represents our pro
forma total debt that is secured by a lien other than $21 million of debt related to New Market Tax Credits
described in “Description of Other Indebtedness” less our pro forma cash and cash equivalents divided by
Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA.

(8) Ratio of pro forma net total debt to Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA represents our pro forma total
debt other than $21 million of debt related to New Market Tax Credits less our pro forma cash and cash

of the Catalyst Joint Venture sales.

(3) Maintenance capital expenditures include spending on maintenance of business, cost savings initiatives and
health, safety and environmental initiatives. Expansion capital expenditures include spending to drive
organic sales growth. These capital expenditures represent PQ Holdings’ “book” capital expenditures for
which it has recorded, but not necessarily paid for the capital expenditures.

(4) Free cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital
expenditures include spending on maintenance of business, cost savings initiatives and health, safety and
environmental initiatives.

**_Eco Services Operations LLC_**

The following tables set forth certain summary historical condensed consolidated financial and other data of

Eco as of and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. Eco’s statements of operations and other
financial data for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements of Eco included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The summary historical
consolidated financial data set forth below should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial
Information,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of Eco,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Eco” and Eco’s
consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto each of which is included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

On December 1, 2014, substantially all of the assets of Solvay USA Inc.’s Eco Services business unit were

acquired by Eco Services Operations LLC, an indirect subsidiary of funds controlled by CCMP. In connection
with the 2014 Acquisition, the acquisition method of accounting was applied and the assets and liabilities of Eco
were adjusted to fair value on December 1, 2014. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of
accounting, Eco’s financial statement presentations distinguish between a predecessor period prior to the 2014
Acquisition and a successor period subsequent to the 2014 Acquisition. The Successor applied acquisition
accounting and its financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting that is based on the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 1, 2014. The financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2014 in the tables below is presented on a combined basis and is not in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The combined basis results were aggregated from the results of the Predecessor and Successor for the
related periods. We believe that presentation on a combined basis is meaningful as it allows the financial data to
be analyzed to comparable subsequent periods.

(h) Represents Eco’s estimate of expenses needed to operate the business on a standalone basis following
the 2014 Acquisition, including costs relating to incremental headcount, information technology related
costs, legal costs and insurance costs, and replace the corporate cost allocations.

(i) Represents incremental bonus expense paid to former Solvay employees prior to the completion of the
2014 Acquisition.

(j) Represents one-time costs related to the unanticipated plant outage at one of Eco’s west coast facilities
in November 2014.

(k) Represents costs under a transition services agreement with Solvay which provides certain transition
services to Eco by Solvay following the 2014 Acquisition. The transition services agreement ended in
2015.

(l) Represents an accrual for potential rail car damages that was reversed entirely in 2013 as it was no
longer required.

(m) The contract adjustments are related to the following: (i) Eco shares its Baton Rouge, Louisiana plant

with Solvay’s Aroma operations and Eco has historically provided services, such as waste treatment,
supply of sulfuric acid, shared security and logistics under an intercompany agreement; and (ii) Eco
also supplies acid to Solvay’s precipitated Silica manufacturing operations in Chicago Heights, Illinois.
These adjustments are based on Eco’s estimate of incremental revenue to the business that would have
been realized had the intercompany agreements historically been on third-party terms as reflected in the
new agreements entered into between Eco and Solvay in connection with the 2014 Acquisition.

(n) Relates to non-cash defined benefit pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2015.

(o) Represents the non-cash loss for the disposal of property, plant and equipment for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

(p) Relates to various other non-recurring adjustments, including among other things, expenses related to
changes in estimates for identified environmental liabilities, non-recurring legal costs allocated to Eco
by Solvay associated with an employee matter, removal of information technology and research and
development charges from Solvay that did not continue after the 2014 Acquisition, offset by insurance
proceeds associated with flooding at our Baton Rouge, LA plant in 2013, and fringe benefit refunds
received related to prior periods.

(3) Free cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital
expenditures include spending on maintenance of business, cost savings initiatives and health, safety and
environmental initiatives.

**RISK FACTORS**

_This offering of Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and_

_uncertainties described below and other information included in this offering memorandum before purchasing_
_the Notes offered hereby. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, operating_
_results and prospects could be materially adversely affected, which in turn could adversely affect the trading_
_price of the Notes and our ability to service and repay the Notes._

**Risks Related to Our Combined Business**

**_As a global business, we are exposed to local business risks in different countries, which could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

We have significant operations in many countries, including manufacturing sites, research and development

(“R&D”) facilities and sales personnel and customer support operations. Currently, we operate 68 manufacturing
facilities across six continents. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our foreign subsidiaries accounted for
39% of our sales on a pro forma combined basis. Our operations are affected directly and indirectly by global
regulatory, economic and political conditions, including:

   - new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions;

   - export duties or import quotas;

   - domestic and foreign customs and tariffs or other trade barriers;

   - potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes;

   - managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations;

   - increased costs of, and availability of, raw materials, transportation or shipping;

   - credit risk and financial condition of local customers and distributors;

   - potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights;

   - risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments;

   - potential imposition of restrictions on investments;

   - the imposition of withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income, or the adoption of other

restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;

   - capital controls;

   - potential difficulties in obtaining and enforcing legal judgments in jurisdictions outside the United States;

   - potential difficulties in obtaining and enforcing relief in the United States against parties located outside

the United States;

   - difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables;

   - risks relating to environmental, health and safety matters; and

   - local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions

and political instability in certain countries.

In addition, our facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could result in full or partial disruption of

the activities of such facilities. See “—The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including natural
disasters and domestic and international terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our
products.”

**_We are affected by general economic conditions and an economic downturn could adversely affect our_**
**_operations and financial results._**

We sell performance chemicals that are used in manufacturing processes and as components of or

ingredients in other products and, as a result, our sales are correlated with and affected by fluctuations in the
level of industrial production and manufacturing output and general economic activity. Producers of performance
chemicals, in particular, are likely to reduce their output in periods of significant contraction in industrial and
consumer demand, while demand for the products we distribute often depends on trends in demand in the enduses our customers serve. Our profit margins, as well as overall demand for our products and services, could
decline as a result of a large number of factors outside our control, including economic recessions, changes in
industrial production processes or consumer preferences, changes in laws and regulations affecting the chemicals
industry and the manner in which they are enforced, inflation, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange
rates and changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of governments in the regions in which we operate.

General economic conditions and macroeconomic trends, as well as the creditworthiness of our customers,

could affect overall demand for products. Any overall decline in the demand for our products could significantly
reduce our sales and profitability. If the creditworthiness of our customers declines, we would face increased
credit risk. In addition, volatility and disruption in financial markets could adversely affect our sales and results
of operations by limiting our customers’ ability to obtain financing necessary to maintain or expand their own
operations.

**_Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows._**

We incur currency transaction risk whenever we or one of our subsidiaries enter into either a purchase or a

sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. It is possible that
volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations and cash flows. In the past, we have experienced economic loss and a negative impact on earnings as a
result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Any future fluctuations may have a similar or greater
impact on our business since we expect that the amount of our sales denominated in non-dollar currencies may
increase in future periods. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations of PQ Holdings—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

As a result of our international operations, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated 39% of our

sales on a pro forma combined basis and incurred a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than
U.S. dollars. To the extent we are unable to match sales made in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same
currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. Additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars, if we
generate sales or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into dollars can result in a
significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings. In addition, our debt service
requirements are primarily in U.S. dollars even though a significant percentage of our cash flow is generated in
foreign currencies. The main currencies to which we are exposed, besides the U.S. dollar, are the Euro, the
British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar and the Japanese
yen. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years
and may continue to do so in the future. In many cases, we sell exclusively in those jurisdictions and do not have
the ability to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations through external means. In addition, currency
fluctuations may affect the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows between financial periods.

**_Our international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws, trade and export controls and_**
**_regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions in which we do business._**

Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and

regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply
with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies,

31


-----

individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment
decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anticorruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and the U.K. Bribery Act
(“UKBA”). The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of
influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and
requires us to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect our
transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and
representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA and UKBA. In addition,
some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of
corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. In
addition, we are subject to applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations imposed by
the U.S. government and other countries. Changes in export controls or trade sanctions laws may restrict our
business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or regions or with sanctioned
entities or individuals, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violations of these legal
requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits,
injunctions, debarment from government contracts, loss of export privileges as well as other remedial measures.
We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with
applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. These policies and procedures are codified in our Code of
Conduct and other various policies. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will
effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a
violation could subject us to governmental investigations and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Alternative technology or other changes in our customers’ products may reduce or eliminate the need for our_**
**_specialty chemicals, catalysts and engineered glass products._**

Changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the

specialty chemicals, catalysts and engineered glass products that we produce, or make our specialty chemicals,
catalysts and engineered glass products unnecessary. Our customers may also pursue alternative technology that
could eliminate the need for certain of our specialty chemicals, catalysts and engineered glass products. For
example, over the last five years, customers in the detergent industry have significantly reduced their usage of
zeolites. As a result, our sales of zeolite have declined from 16% of PQ’s sales in the year ended December 31,
2009 to 8% of PQ’s sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. The potential development and implementation
of new technology could seriously impair our ability to profitably market some of our products if we are unable
to respond appropriately to such new developments. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

**_Our new product development and R&D efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more_**
**_effective or successful products._**

The specialty chemicals, catalysts and engineered glass products industries are subject to periodic

technological changes and ongoing product improvements. In order to maintain our margins and remain
competitive, we must successfully develop, manufacture and market new or improved products. As a result, we
must commit substantial resources each year to new product development and R&D. Ongoing investments in
new product development and R&D for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional
increase in revenues. Additionally, for any new product program, there is a risk of technical or market failure in
which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive
position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs. Moreover, new
products may have lower margins than the products they replace.

We also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced

products. As new products are introduced, our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be
marketed more effectively than our products. If we fail to develop new products, maintain or improve our

32


-----

margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments, our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows will suffer. In addition, there can be no assurance that new products will
successfully attract end-users.

**_If we are unable to pass on increases in raw material prices, including natural gas, or to retain or replace our_**
**_key suppliers, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected._**

To produce chemicals and engineered glass products, we purchase significant amounts of raw materials,

such as sodium carbonate, or soda ash, cullet, industrial sand, aluminum trihydrate, or ATH, sodium hydroxide
(commonly known as caustic soda) and sulfur (including hydrogen sulfite), and purchase significant amounts of
natural gas to supply the energy required in our production process. The cost of these raw materials, in the
aggregate, represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Our results of operations have been and
could in the future be significantly affected by increases in these costs. In addition, if any of the raw materials
that we use become unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced, then we may not
be able to obtain suitable and cost-effective substitutes. Any interruption of supply or any price increase of raw
materials could adversely affect our profitability.

We purchase certain of our North American soda ash requirements through long-term supply contracts and

have historically been able to mitigate exposure to increases in pricing. As these contracts expire, we cannot
provide assurance that we will be able to renegotiate or enter into new supply contracts that will offer protection
from pricing and other fluctuations or be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Other than with natural gas, we
typically do not enter into any long-term forward contracts to hedge raw material price risks that we face. In the
event of future price increases in soda ash or any of the other raw materials necessary to produce our basic
chemicals, we may not be able to match raw material price increases with corresponding product price increases.
Although in the past we have entered into long-term supply contracts for certain of our raw materials, we cannot
provide assurance that in the future we will enter into such contracts or that any such contracts will be on
favorable terms or will adequately protect us against increases in the costs of raw materials.

While we attempt to match raw material price increases with corresponding product price increases, our

ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials to our customers is, to a large extent, dependent upon our
contractual arrangements and market conditions. Additionally, changes in the price or availability of raw
materials could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results. There may be periods of time
during which we are not able to recover increases in the cost of raw materials due to our contractual
arrangements or to weakness in demand for, or oversupply of, our products. Specifically, timing differences in
pricing between raw material prices, which may change daily, and product prices, which in many cases are
adjusted only quarterly or less often, sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates for increases, have had
and may continue to have a negative effect on profitability. Even in periods during which raw material prices
decline, we may suffer decreasing profits if raw material price reductions occur at a slower rate than decreases in
the selling prices of our products. In addition, when raw material costs decrease, customers may seek relief in the
form of lower sales prices. Furthermore, some of our customers in our Performance Chemicals business may take
advantage of fluctuating prices by building inventories when they expect product prices to increase and reducing
inventories when they expect product prices to decrease. Further, volatility in costs and pricing can result in
commercial disputes with customers and suppliers with respect to interpretations of complex contractual
arrangements. Significant adverse resolution of any such disputes could also reduce our profitability.

We also obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from certain key suppliers. If any of these suppliers

is unable to meet its obligations under current supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to
obtain the necessary raw materials and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products.

In addition, we purchase significant amounts of natural gas to supply the energy required in our production

processes for our products. Historically, the cost of natural gas has fluctuated significantly, and our results of
operations have been affected by these increases. We have attempted to mitigate our exposure to natural gas

33


-----

volatility by implementing a hedging program in the United States, and entering into forward purchases in the
United States, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world; however, we cannot provide assurance that our
hedging strategy will be successful. If energy prices rise, our profitability could be adversely affected.

**_We face substantial competition in the industries in which we operate._**

Some of the industries in which we operate for the Performance Chemicals, Catalysts and Specialty Glass

Materials businesses are highly competitive, and this competition could harm our business and our corresponding
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Sales dynamics in Europe and certain Asia-Pacific
regions are particularly competitive due to the number of regional competitors. In the Catalysts business, we
compete against large international producers as well. We believe that the most significant competitive factors
for these products are quality, know-how and selling price. We could be subject to adverse results caused by our
competitors’ pricing decisions. In addition, current and future consolidation among our competitors and
customers may cause us to lose supply share as well as put downward pressure on pricing. In addition, some of
our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and/or may have less
debt than we do. As a result, those competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the
industries in which we compete and throughout the economy as a whole. As the demand for our products
expands, we expect that existing competitors may commit more resources to the end-uses and geographies in
which we participate. We may not be able to compete effectively in these various areas in the future and our
competitive position and results of operations may suffer as a result.

In the Performance Chemicals business, our competitors range from large international companies, such as

OxyChem and W.R. Grace, to a large number of smaller regional companies of varying sizes. In the Catalysts
business, our competitors include Clariant, Tosoh and W.R. Grace. In the Specialty Glass Materials business, our
competitors include Sovitec and Swarco, among others.

For the Eco business, we compete with multiple producers of U.S. sulfuric acid regeneration products and

virgin sulfuric acid products. We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the industry are price,
product quality and services. Some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because
their costs are lower than ours. In addition, some of our competitors’ financial, technological and other resources
may be greater than ours and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions in the
industry. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and
changes in customer requirements. Further, consolidation of our competitors may make it more difficult for us to
compete with them. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our sulfuric
acid business.

**_Our Eco business relies on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its business. A loss of one_**
**_or more customers could adversely impact our profitability._**

Our Eco business generates a significant portion of its net sales from a small number of customers. Our top

10 sulfuric acid regeneration customers represented approximately 97% of our overall acid regeneration sales and
our top 10 virgin acid customers represented approximately 80% of our virgin acid sales for 2015. While many
of these customers are under long term contracts with us, we cannot provide assurance that we will maintain our
relationship with any particular customer or continue to provide services to any specific customers at current
levels. In addition, at several of our facilities we are connected to a customer by a pipeline. In 2015,
approximately 32% of our regenerated sulfuric acid volumes were shipped by captive pipelines. A loss of any
significant customer, including a pipeline customer, or a decrease in the provision of services to any such
customer could, in the short term, adversely affect our business until alternative arrangements are secured. Any
alternative arrangement to replace a loss of a pipeline customer would result in increased variable costs relating
to shipping our product. In addition, any new customer agreement entered into by us may not have terms as
favorable as those contained in current customer agreements and the failure to obtain such favorable terms could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally,

34


-----

refineries have undergone significant consolidation and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation would
increase our customers’ leverage over their suppliers, including us and could cause downward pressure on prices,
which may adversely affect our profitability.

**_Our multi-year customer contracts in our Eco business are subject to potential early termination and these_**
**_contracts may not be renewed at the end of their respective terms._**

Many of the customer contracts in our Eco business are multi-year agreements. Sulfuric acid regeneration

customer contracts are typically on five to ten year terms. Our regeneration contracts with major refinery
customers have contract termination notice periods of one to two years. Virgin sulfuric acid customer contracts
are typically on one to five year terms, with larger customers favoring longer terms. Excluding contracts with
automatic evergreen provisions, approximately 65% of 2015 sulfuric acid volumes were under contracts expiring
at the end of 2018. While we have a strong re-contracting history, we cannot provide assurance that our existing
contracts will not be subjected to early terminations or that our expiring contracts will be renewed at the end of
their respective terms. If we receive a significant number of such contract terminations and experience nonrenewals from key customers, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially
adversely affected.

**_Reductions in transportation safety spending or taxes earmarked for transportation safety spending could_**
**_result in a decline in our sales._**

Approximately 12% of our sales on a pro forma combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 were

derived from transportation safety products. Sales of our Specialty Glass Materials products to the transportation
safety end-uses are in part dependent upon federal, state, local and foreign government budgets. A decrease in or
termination of governmental budgeting for new transportation safety programs or a significant decrease in the
use of our materials in any new transportation safety projects could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows by decreasing the profitability of our Specialty Glass
Materials business.

**_Demand for some of our products is seasonal and we may experience prolonged depressed conditions for our_**
**_products._**

Our Specialty Glass Materials business, which accounted for 19% of our sales on a pro forma combined

basis for the year ended December 31, 2015, typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in sales and profitability,
with generally lower sales and profit in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonality is due to
the fact that highway striping projects typically occur during warmer weather months. Our Eco business, which
accounted for 24% of our sales on a pro forma combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2015, also
typically experiences seasonal fluctuations as a result of oil refineries experiencing higher demand for gasoline
products in the summer months. As a result, our working capital requirements tend to be higher in the first and
fourth quarter and, accordingly, can adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow. Sales in our Performance
Chemicals and Catalysts businesses, which accounted for 57% of our sales on a pro forma combined basis for the
year ended December 31, 2015, reflect the general cyclical patterns of the industries for the end-users of our
chemical and catalysts products.

Sales of certain of our products, including a substantial portion of our Performance Chemicals and Catalysts

businesses, are dependent upon the continued demand from a number of key customers. In general, downturns in
economic conditions can cause fluctuations in demand for our and our customers’ products, product prices,
volumes and margins.

**_If we lose certain key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business could be_**
**_adversely affected because we may not be able to execute our business strategy._**

Our success depends, in part, upon the continued services of our highly skilled personnel involved in

management, research, production and distribution and, in particular, upon the efforts and abilities of our key

35


-----

officers. Although we believe that we are currently adequately staffed in key positions, we cannot provide
assurance that we will be able to retain such personnel on acceptable terms or at all. If we lose the service of any
of our key officers, we may not be able to hire replacements with the same level of industry experience and
knowledge necessary to execute our business strategy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Our expansion projects may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues, or may never_**
**_generate revenues, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy._**

We have made and continue to make significant investments in each of our businesses. These projects

require us to commit significant capital to, among other things, implement engineering plans and obtain the
necessary permits, before we generate revenues related to the investments in these businesses. The projects may
take longer to complete and require additional unanticipated expenditures, and may never generate profits. If we
fail to recover our investment or the projects are never profitable, this may materially and adversely affect our
ability to implement our business strategy.

**_We may be liable for damages based on product liability claims brought against us and customers in our end-_**
**_use products or for costs associated with recalls of our or our customers’ products._**

The sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims or voluntary or government-ordered

product recalls. Certain of our products provide critical performance functions to our customers’ end-products.
Some of our products are used in and around other chemical manufacturing facilities, highways, airports and
other locations where personal injury or property damage may occur. Some of our products are used in beverage,
personal care and medicinal applications. There can be no assurance that our products will not be the subject of
product liability claims or suits or that we or our customers will not be subject to a voluntary or governmentordered product recall. If one of our or our customers’ products is the subject of a recall, we may incur significant
costs and reputational damage and suffer loss of customers as a result. In addition, if a person brings a product
liability claim or suit against one of our customers, this customer may attempt to seek contribution from us. A
product recall or successful product liability claim or series of claims against us in excess of our insurance
coverage for which we are not otherwise indemnified could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Certain of our businesses are subject to government regulation, and could be adversely affected by future_**
**_governmental regulation._**

In order to obtain regulatory approval of certain of our new products, we must, among other things,

demonstrate to the relevant authority that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are
capable of manufacturing the product in accordance with current regulations. The process of seeking approvals
can be costly, time-consuming and subject to unanticipated and significant delays. Any delay in obtaining, or any
failure to obtain or maintain, these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to
generate sales from those products, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows.

Our products, including the raw materials we handle, are subject to rigorous chemical registration and

industrial hygiene regulations and investigation. There is a risk that a key raw material, chemical or substance or
one of the end products of which our products are a part may be recharacterized as having a toxicological or
health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees. Industrial hygiene regulations are
continually strengthened and if such recharacterization occurred, the relevant raw material, chemical or product
may be banned or we may incur increased costs in order to comply with new requirements. Changes in industrial
hygiene regulations also affect the marketability of certain of our products, and future regulatory changes may
have a material adverse effect on our business.

New laws and regulations, and changes in existing laws and regulations, may be introduced in the future that

could result in additional compliance costs, seizures, confiscation, recall or monetary fines, any of which could

36


-----

prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our products. For example, as discussed in more
detail in “Business—Environmental Regulation” and “Business—Chemical Product Regulation,” we may be
materially impacted by regulatory initiatives worldwide with respect to chemical product safety such as the
European Union regulation “Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances”
(“REACH”), or similar regulations being enacted in other countries (e.g., China REACH; Korea REACH). If we
fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines,
injunctions, recalls or seizures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. In addition, we benefit from certain trade protections, including antidumping
protection. If we were to lose these protections, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

**_We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulations and face various risks associated_**
**_with potential non-compliance or releases of hazardous materials._**

Like other chemical companies, our operations and properties are subject to extensive and stringent federal,

state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning, among other things,
emissions to the air, discharges to land, surface, subsurface strata and water and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous materials. We also are subject to other federal,
state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding chemical and product safety as well as employee health
and safety matters, including process safety requirements. These laws and regulations may become more
stringent over time and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in significant fines or
penalties. For instance, in November 2015, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
(“PADEP”) issued a $1.7 million fine associated with alleged air emissions violations related to excessive short
term emissions of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, and excessive long term 12-month rolling sums of the
two pollutants, at our Chester, PA, site. We have appealed alleged violation and associated fine. We also remain
subject to a 2007 Consent Decree that resolves certain alleged Clean Air Act violations at our seven Eco
operating locations involving New Source Review (“NSR”), Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”),
and New Source Performance Standard (“NSPS”) obligations under the federal rules for the pollutants sulfur
dioxide and sulfuric acid mist. The Consent Decree required Solvay (the owner at the time) to pay a $2 million
penalty and spend approximately $34 million on air pollution controls at our facilities, the majority of which was
received from customers in contractual arrangements. Work under the Consent Decree has proceeded since 2007,
and, we believe that all of the significant capital improvements related to the Consent Decree have been
completed. One of our operating locations has been released from the scope of the Consent Decree and we are
seeking release of the other locations covered by the Consent Decree. Finally, these laws and regulations require
us to obtain environmental registrations, licenses, permits, and other approvals in order to operate and can require
us to install expensive pollution control equipment at our facilities or incur other capital expenditures aimed at
achieving or maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations. Due to the Business Combination, many of
the business’ permits need to be transferred or reissued to us. Depending on the permit, this requires either pre or
post-closing notification to regulatory authorities or regulatory authority consent. The loss or delay of a
significant permit or license could have a material effect on our operations and net sales.

Our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production, use, handling, processing, storage

and transportation of significant quantities of hazardous materials. Under certain environmental laws, liability for
the cleanup of contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. We could be held
responsible for all cleanup costs at a site, whether currently or formerly owned or operated, and regardless of
fault, knowledge, timing or cause of the contamination. In addition, we may face liability for personal injury,
property damage, and natural resource damage resulting from environmental conditions attributable to us. As
such, a product spill or emission at one of our facilities or during transportation could have adverse consequences
on the environment and surrounding community and could result in significant liabilities with respect to
investigation and remediation. Our sites have an extended history of industrial use, and soil and groundwater
contamination exists at some of our sites. Under certain environmental laws, liability for the cleanup of
contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. As of December 31, 2015, we
have current remediation or monitoring obligations at our sites in Rahway, NJ; Dominguez, CA; Martinez, CA;

37


-----

Hammond, IN; Portland, OR and Rio Claro, Brazil, as well as a formerly owned site in Tacoma, WA. The
Martinez facility also is involved in a long-term project to remediate and restore the Peyton Slough, an adjacent
surface water estuary that was contaminated as a result of historical copper smelting activities on the Martinez
site prior to the acquisition of the property. This project is in its final stages. Our reserves associated with
environmental matters were $9.9 million as of December 31, 2015. There also is a potential risk that our longterm industrial use of these sites may have resulted in yet to be discovered contamination, which we could be
required to investigate and, if warranted, remediate, as liability potentially could be imposed without regard to
whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such hazardous substances and, in some cases, liability may be
joint and several. Discovery of additional or unknown conditions at our facilities could have an adverse impact
on our business by substantially increasing our capital expenditures, compliance or investigation, and
remediation costs. Further, we may be jointly and severally liable for contamination at third party sites where we
or our predecessors in interest have sent waste for treatment or disposal even if in doing so we complied with
applicable laws. Such environmental liabilities attached to our properties or for properties which we are
otherwise responsible could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

**_Existing and proposed regulations to address climate change by limiting greenhouse gas emissions may cause_**
**_us to incur significant additional operating and capital expenses._**

Certain of our operations result in emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), such as carbon dioxide and

methane. Growing concern about the sources and impacts of global climate change has led to a number of
domestic and foreign legislative and administrative measures, both proposed and enacted, to monitor, regulate
and limit carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. In the EU, our emissions are regulated under the EU
Emissions Trading System, or EU ETS, an EU-wide trading scheme for industrial GHG emissions. The EU ETS
is anticipated to become progressively more stringent over time, including by reducing the number of allowances
to emit GHGs that EU member states will allocate without charge to industrial facilities. In the United States, the
Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated federal GHG regulations under the Clean Air
Act affecting certain sources. The EPA has issued mandatory GHG reporting requirements, under which our
Dominguez, CA and Baton Rouge, LA facilities currently report. Moreover, California has enacted the Global
Warming Solutions Act of 2006, or Assembly Bill 32, a law that establishes a comprehensive program to reduce
GHG emissions from all sources throughout the state and contains reporting requirements under which our
Dominguez, CA and Martinez, CA facilities report. Our Dominguez facility participates in the emissions trading
market established under Assembly Bill 32. Although we believe it is likely that GHG emissions will continue to
be regulated in the United States and other countries (in addition to the EU) in the future, we cannot yet predict
the form such regulation will take (such as a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax or other
regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate any costs that we may be required to incur in respect of such
requirements, for example, to install emissions control equipment, purchase emissions allowances, administer
and manage our GHG emissions program, or address other regulatory obligations. Such requirements also could
adversely affect our energy supply, or the costs (and types) of raw materials we use for fuel. Regulations
controlling or limiting GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition
or results of operations, including by reducing demand for our products.

**_The insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures._**

We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all

risks associated with the operation of our business or our manufacturing process and the related use, storage and
transportation of raw materials, products and wastes in or from our manufacturing sites or our distribution
centers. While we have purchased what we deem to be adequate limits of coverage and broadly worded policies,
our coverage is subject to limitations, including higher self-insured retentions or deductibles and maximum limits
and liabilities covered. Notwithstanding diligent efforts to successfully procure specialty coverage for
environmental liability and remediation, we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the terms of coverage
of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In addition, from time to time,
various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemicals, catalysts and engineered glass products
industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, at all. We are potentially at

38


-----

additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain
replacement insurance on acceptable terms or insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential
liabilities in the future. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could
adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers
could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. In the future, we may
not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on
coverage that we maintain.

**_We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from non-payment or non-performance by our customers._**

Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to minimize or mitigate customer credit risk. Our

customers may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations. These
and other financial problems that may be experienced by our customers, as well as potential financial weakness
in our industry, may increase our risk in extending trade credit to customers. A significant adverse change in a
customer relationship or in a customer’s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with
that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or limit our ability to
collect accounts receivable from that customer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

**_We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a_**
**_result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications._**

Our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products. If a product fails to

perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer
could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform
as guaranteed. A successful claim or series of claims against us could cause reputational harm and have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or
more customers.

**_We may engage in strategic acquisitions or dispositions of certain assets and/or businesses that could affect_**
**_our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity._**

We may selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures, each of which inherently

involves a number of risks and presents financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:

   - potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;

   - difficulty with integration of personnel and financial and other systems;

   - hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and

   - increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.

In addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in the integration of acquired businesses. Also,

the presence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of
acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our acquisition and joint venture strategy may
not be successfully received by customers, and we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions or
joint ventures.

We may also opportunistically pursue dispositions of certain assets and/or businesses, which may involve

material amounts of assets or lines of business, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity. If any such dispositions were to occur, under the terms of the credit agreement governing our New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the 2022 Notes and the Notes offered hereby, we
may be required to apply the proceeds of the sale to repay any borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the 2022 Notes or the Notes offered hereby.

**_Our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their_**
**_obligations, or differences in views among our joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or_**
**_failures to agree on major issues, which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to_**
**_dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures._**

We currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the

future. The nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture
partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its
business plan. In that case, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to
increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture. Also, differences in views among joint venture
participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues. If these differences cause the
joint ventures to deviate from their business plans, our results of operations could be adversely affected. For
example, we do not control any of the joint ventures within the Catalyst joint ventures and cannot unilaterally
undertake strategies, plans, goals and operations of the Catalyst joint ventures or determine when they will make
cash distributions to us even though our proportionate interest in the Catalyst joint ventures’ results of operations
are reflected in our non-GAAP financial measures. Differences in views among joint venture participants and our
inability to unilaterally implement sales and productions strategies or determine cash distributions from our joint
ventures may significantly impact short-term and longer term financial results and financial condition.

**_Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and_**
**_growth._**

Protection of our proprietary processes, methods, compounds and other technologies is important to our

business. We depend upon our ability to develop and protect our intellectual property rights to distinguish our
products from those of our competitors. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in
the loss of valuable technologies or other intellectual property or having to pay other companies for infringing on
their intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law
as well as judicial enforcement to protect such technologies and trademarks. In addition, the laws of many
foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United
States. As of December 31, 2015, we owned over 50 patented inventions, with approximately 280 patents issued
in countries around the world and approximately 145 patent applications pending worldwide covering more than
15 additional inventions. Some of these patents are licensed to others. In addition, we have acquired the rights
under patents and inventions of others through licenses.

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other

trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position, which may not provide us with complete
protection against competitors. While it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees
and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurances that:

   - our confidentiality agreements will not be breached,

   - they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or

   - adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of these trade secrets

and know-how.

In addition, there can be no assurances that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through

independent development or other access by legal means.

Measures taken by us to protect these assets and rights may not provide meaningful protection for our trade

secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an
unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise. In addition, our patents and other
intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable.
Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that any pending patent or trademark application filed by us will result

40


-----

in an issued patent or trademark or, if patents are issued to us, that those patents will provide meaningful
protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. The failure of our patents or other measures
to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise, methods
and compounds or trademarks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. See “Business—Intellectual Property.”

**_Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected_**
**_costs or prevent us from selling our products._**

Although it is our policy and intention not to infringe valid patents, in the future our processes, apparatuses,

technology, proprietary manufacturing expertise, methods, compounds and products may infringe on issued
patents or infringe or misappropriate other intellectual property rights of others. For example, our products or our
technology may be subject to filed patent applications by third parties that cover our products or technology. If
patents are subsequently issued on these applications or if patents that cover our products or technology are
already in existence, we may be liable for infringement. We may also be subject to legal proceedings and claims
in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents or trademarks or
infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in
connection with their use of our products. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming,
regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel
from operating our business. If we were to discover that our processes, apparatuses, technology, proprietary
manufacturing expertise, methods, compounds, products or trademarks infringe the valid intellectual property
rights of others, we might need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer or rebrand our
products in order to avoid infringement. We may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms,
or at all, or be able to reengineer our products successfully or at an acceptable cost. Moreover, if we are sued for
infringement and lose the suit, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or
selling the infringing products or technology or using the infringing trademark. Any of the foregoing could cause
us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products, which could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if we ultimately prevail, the existence of
lawsuits could in certain cases prompt our customers to switch to alternative products.

**_Losses and damages in connection with information technology risks could adversely affect our operations._**

Our operations materially depend on a complex, worldwide and highly available information technology

infrastructure with integrated processes. The networks and data centers we use are subject to damage by material
events such as major disruption to public infrastructure (in particular power outages, cyber or terrorist attacks,
fires, etc.). Despite various disaster recovery plans, such an event could cause material disruptions in our
operations.

The broad use of information technology systems has increased the risk of unauthorized access to

confidential data (such as customer information, strategic projects, product formulas and other trade secrets) and
the risk of destruction or manipulation of material data by employees or third parties. Although we have
introduced many security measures (like firewalls and information technology security policies), we cannot
ensure that these measures offer the appropriate level of security.

**_We may need to recognize impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed_**
**_assets._**

We are required to test goodwill and any other intangible asset with an indefinite life for possible

impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment.
We are also required to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are
indicators of a possible impairment.

41


-----

There is significant judgment required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill, identified

intangible assets and fixed assets. If, as a result of a general economic slowdown, deterioration in one or more of
the industries in which we operate or in our financial performance and/or future outlook, the estimated fair value
of our long-lived assets decreases, we may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired. An
impairment charge would be determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets and any such impairment
charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

**_Our ability to utilize our net operating losses is uncertain._**

As of December 31, 2015, PQ had $288 million of net operating losses for U.S. federal income tax

purposes. Our ability to utilize these net operating losses to offset future income tax liabilities depends on our
future financial performance and our future taxable income. In addition, our utilization of these net operating
losses is currently limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
impacting our ability to realize the benefits of these net operating losses. We do not expect the Business
Combination, alone, to result in an additional limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Code. However, if any
future ownership changes occurring within three years of the closing date of the Business Combination among
stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of our stock, in addition to the Business Combination,
were to result in an aggregate ownership change of more than 50% of our stock, then our utilization of these net
operating losses and certain built-in losses would be subject to an additional limitation imposed by Section 382
of the Code.

**_The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including natural disasters and domestic and international_**
**_terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products._**

Natural disasters and other weather-related disruptions and domestic and international terrorist attacks

would affect our ability to sell to our customers by impacting many of our customers and our suppliers of certain
raw materials, which would have an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products. If tornadoes or
other natural disasters or terrorist attacks occur in the future near our sites, they could negatively affect the results
of operations in the affected regions, as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy. In particular, our
sulfuric acid operations are predominantly located in the Gulf Coast, which is susceptible to hurricanes, and
Northern California, which is susceptible to the risk of significant earthquakes. Extreme weather in these regions
could impact our ability to operate our facilities on the Gulf and West Coasts. Furthermore, there is a risk that our
customers, including refinery customers located on the Gulf and West Coasts, could be impacted by such events
there by affecting demand for our products and services.

**_We depend on good relations with our workforce, and any significant disruptions could adversely affect our_**
**_operations._**

As of December 31, 2015, we had 2,983 employees on a pro forma combined basis. As of December 31,

2015 on a pro forma basis, approximately 40% of our employees were represented by a union or workers council.
In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide
greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the United States. Such employment rights
require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor
arrangements. For example, many of our employees in Europe are represented by workers councils that must
approve any changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may
impede efforts to restructure our workforce. Although we believe that we have a good working relationship with
our employees, a strike, work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees
could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs.

42


-----

**_We have unfunded and underfunded pension plan liabilities. We will require current and future operating_**
**_cash flow to fund these shortfalls. We have no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy_**
**_these obligations._**

We maintain defined benefit pension plans covering employees who meet age and service requirements.

While some of our plans have been frozen, our net pension liability and cost is materially affected by the
discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the longevity and actuarial profile of our workforce, the level
of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can
result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in
a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. Assets available to fund the pension benefit obligation of
the U.S. advance-funded pension plans at December 31, 2015 were approximately $271.3 million, or
approximately $93.3 million less than the measured pension benefit obligation on a U.S. GAAP basis. In
addition, any changes in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of
pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension
cost in the following years. Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant
changes in the net periodic pension cost in the following years.

We also contribute to two multi-employer pension plans on behalf of certain of our employees in the U.S.

pursuant to union agreements that generally provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective
bargaining agreements. A total of approximately 20 employees currently participate in such multi-employer
pension plans. Funding requirements for benefit obligations of multi-employer pension plans are subject to
certain regulatory requirements, and we may be required to make cash contributions to one of these plans to
satisfy certain underfunded benefit obligations. Absent an applicable exemption, a contributor to a U.S.
multi-employer plan is liable upon its withdrawal from, or the termination of, a plan, for its proportionate share
of the plan’s underfunding, if any.

**_We are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, as well as administrative and_**
**_regulatory proceedings, and adverse results may harm our business._**

We cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution or the ultimate outcome of

litigation and other administrative and regulatory proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or
damage awards, and adverse results in any litigation and other administrative and regulatory proceedings may
materially harm our business. Litigation and other administrative and regulatory proceedings may include, but
are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements, environmental, health and
safety, joint venture agreements, labor and employment, domestic and foreign antitrust matters or other harms
resulting from the actions of individuals or entities outside of our control. In the case of intellectual property
litigation and proceedings, adverse outcomes could include the cancellation, invalidation or other loss of material
intellectual property rights used in our business and injunctions prohibiting our use of business processes or
technology that are subject to third-party patents or other third-party intellectual property rights. Litigation based
on environmental matters or exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace or from our products could result
in significant liability for us. Adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business. See
“Business—Legal Proceedings.”

**_We may be subjected to asbestos premises liability and product liability claims._**

Our Eco business is a defendant in several legal actions from contractors and others related to damages

caused by the alleged exposure of the plaintiffs to asbestos containing building materials historically located at
our plants or sites. We typically are not named as a single party defendant in these cases and the alleged
exposures in cases filed against us tend to be for a shorter time period (e.g., several weeks or months of exposure
while working at our sites out of a claimed total exposure that could total 30 years at other sites). We have a
provision on the balance sheet in relation to these claims; however, we additional similar claims could be filed
against us in the future.

43


-----

In addition, we cannot assure you that as a result of past or future operations, there will not be claims of

injury by employees or members of the public due to exposure, or alleged exposure, to such hazardous materials.
Furthermore, we, along with our suppliers and customers also face the risk of present and future claims with
respect to workplace exposure, workers’ compensation and other related matters. It is not possible to definitively
predict the actual amount of these liabilities or the timing thereof. A successful class action proceeding, or series
of claims against us in respect of product liability, arising out of exposure to asbestos in excess of our insurance
coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to the Business Combination**

**_Our efforts to combine PQ’s business with Eco’s business may not be successful._**

The management of our combined company will be required to devote a significant amount of time and

attention to the process of integrating the operations of PQ’s business and the business of Eco, which may
decrease the time it will have to serve existing customers, attract new customers and develop new services or
strategies. If the integration of the two companies is not managed successfully by our management, it may result
in interruptions in our business activities, a decrease in the quality of our services, a deterioration in our
employee and customer relationships, increased costs of integration and harm to our reputation, all of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not realize the expected benefits of the Business Combination because of integration difficulties and_**
**_other challenges._**

The success of the Business Combination will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated

synergies and cost savings from integrating the Eco business with PQ’s existing businesses. The integration
process will be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the Eco operations include,
among others:

   - failure to implement our business plan for the combined company;

   - the diversion of management attention and resources;

   - failure to retain customers or key suppliers;

   - unanticipated issues in integrating personnel, information, communications and other systems;

   - applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions;

   - unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;

   - failure to retain key employees;

   - operating, competitive and other risks inherent in PQ’s business and Eco’s business; and

   - unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.

We may not accomplish the integration smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated cost range or

timeframe. The diversion of our management’s attention from our current operations to the integration effort and
any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated
to result from the Business Combination and could adversely affect our business.

**_We may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings or may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order_**
**_to realize them._**

In connection with the Business Combination, we expect to realize cost savings following the

consummation of the Business Combination, primarily relating to the overhead consolidation synergies, cost
improvements, higher labor productivity maintenance and lower fixed freight costs. We may be unable to realize
all of these cost savings within the expected timeframe or at all and we may incur additional and/or unexpected
costs in order to realize them.

44

**_Eco has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. Following the Business_**
**_Combination, if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may_**
**_not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor_**
**_confidence in our company._**

We are not currently required to comply with the rules of the SEC implementing Section 404 of the

Sarbanes-Oxley Act and therefore are not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a private entity, we experienced management
turnover and lack of resources following Eco’s separation from Solvay which led to insufficient knowledge to
effectively support account balances and carry out formal control policies and framework and certain human
resource and payroll records were inherited from Solvay, where no formal processes for record keeping were in
place due to the process of transitioning to PQ’s human resource procedures and processes. These factors, along
with adjustments identified in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2015, resulted in deficiencies that aggregated to a material weakness in Eco’s internal
control over financial reporting. These adjustments relate primarily to reversals of various accruals that were
overstated as of December 31, 2015. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of Eco’s financial
statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.

We cannot be certain that any measures we undertake will successfully remediate the material weakness or

that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future. If our remediation
efforts are not successful or other material weaknesses or control deficiencies occur in the future, we may be
unable to report our financial results accurately on a timely basis, which could cause our reported financial
results to be materially misstated.

**Risks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to_**
**_fulfill our obligations under the Notes, our ability to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur_**
**_additional indebtedness to fund future needs._**

Upon the completion of the Business Combination and the related financing transactions, we will have a

substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, after giving effect to the Business Combination
and the related financing transactions, we would have had total indebtedness of $2,549 million, including the
Notes offered hereby. As of the same date, on a pro forma combined basis, we expect to have an additional $200
million of borrowing capacity (excluding $5.3 million of outstanding letters of credit) available under the New
ABL Facility. We are permitted to draw on the New ABL Facility on the closing date of the Business
Combination in an aggregate principal amount up to $75 million to finance the Business Combination or for
working capital needs. Based on estimated working capital needs as of the closing date of the Business
Combination, we expect to have $44 million outstanding on the New ABL Facility at the closing of this offering.

On a pro forma combined basis, our net interest expense, for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have

been $215.4 million based on the assumed interest rates payable on our pro forma indebtedness. As of
December 31, 2015, on a pro forma combined basis, we would have had outstanding approximately $1,200
million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our New Term Loan Facility and $625 million in
aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our New Senior Unsecured Notes, all of which would bear
interest at a floating rate. We expect to have $44 million outstanding on the New ABL Facility at the closing of
this offering.

Our substantial level of indebtedness will increase the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash

sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our
substantial indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have
important consequences for our noteholders. For example, it could:

   - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the

Notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including

45


-----

restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes and the
agreements governing such other indebtedness;

   - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our

indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
selling and marketing efforts, product development and other purposes;

   - increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a

competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have relatively less indebtedness;

   - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we

operate;

   - expose us to the risk of increasing rates as certain of our borrowings, including under the New Senior

Secured Credit Facilities and the New Senior Unsecured Notes, will be at variable interest rates;

   - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;

   - limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working

capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other corporate purposes; and

   - prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of

certain changes of control, which would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Notes.

The occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,

results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, including the Notes.

**_We will have the ability to incur substantially more indebtedness, including senior secured indebtedness._**

Subject to the restrictions in our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the 2022

Notes, the agreement governing the New Senior Unsecured Notes and the indenture governing the Notes offered
hereby, we may incur significant additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, on a pro forma combined as
adjusted basis, we would have had:

   - $1,722.2 of senior secured debt, consisting of borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities,

the Notes offered hereby, debt related to New Market Tax Credits described in “Description of Other
Indebtedness” and capital leases; and

   - $827.2 million of senior unsecured debt, consisting of the $200 million of 2022 Notes, $625 million of the

New Senior Unsecured Notes and $2.2 million of other debt.

In addition, upon the completion of the Business Combination and the related financing transactions, as of

December 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis, subject to certain limitations, we expect to have an additional $200
million of borrowing capacity (excluding $5.3 million of outstanding letters of credit) under our New ABL
Facility, which, if borrowed, would be senior secured indebtedness. We are permitted to draw on the New ABL
Facility on the closing date of the Business Combination in an aggregate principal amount up to $75 million to
finance the Business Combination or for working capital needs. Based on estimated working capital needs as of
the closing date of the Business Combination, we expect to have $44 million outstanding on the New ABL
Facility at the closing of this offering. We also have the option to add one or more incremental facilities under
(i) the agreement governing our New Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of up to $200 million plus an
unlimited additional amount so long as after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such additional amount,
we are in compliance with certain leverage ratios and (ii) the agreement governing our New ABL Facility in an
aggregate amount of up to $50 million plus an additional amount equal to the excess of the borrowing base over
the then existing commitments so long as after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such additional
amount, we are in compliance with certain leverage ratios. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

Although the terms of our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes,

the agreement governing the New Senior Unsecured Notes and the indenture governing the Notes offered hereby

46


-----

will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions will be subject to a
number of important exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. If we and our restricted subsidiaries incur significant additional indebtedness, the related risks that
we face could increase.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Notes, and may_**
**_be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial

condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and
to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a
level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and
interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be

forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or
restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful
and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results
and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or
operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
indenture governing the 2022 Notes, the indenture governing the Notes offered hereby and the indenture
governing the New Senior Unsecured Notes, will restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds
from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we
could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

**_Because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, we_**
**_are largely dependent on our receipt of distributions and dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries_**
**_and joint ventures for cash to fund all of our operations and expenses, including interest payments._**

A significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures. As a result,

our ability to service our debt is largely dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the
payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or
advances from us. Payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’
or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual
restrictions. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to
holders of our common stock. In addition, there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability
of foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us.

**_Your claims to our assets will be structurally subordinated to all of the creditors of any non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

Not all of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes. In the event that any non-guarantor

subsidiary becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves or otherwise winds up, holders of its
indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that
subsidiary before payments are made to us. Accordingly, claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally
subordinated to the claims of creditors of any future non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors. For the
year ended December 31, 2015, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 35% of our total pro
forma combined sales and 32% of our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, these non-guarantor
subsidiaries represented approximately 19% of our pro forma combined total assets and $174.5 million, or 6% of
our pro forma combined total liabilities as of December 31, 2015.

47


-----

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the New Senior

Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2022 Notes that is not waived by the required
lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are
unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required
payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with
the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our
indebtedness (including covenants in our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indentures governing the
Notes and the 2022 Notes and the agreement governing the New Senior Unsecured Notes), we could be in default
under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such
indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities could elect to terminate
their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our
assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in
the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
New Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2022 Notes to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2022 Notes and seek a waiver,
we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2022 Notes, the lenders could
exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_We will in most cases have control over the collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular assets by_**
**_us could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes and the guarantees thereof._**

We will be allowed to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect,

invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral securing the Notes, with certain limited exceptions. To the
extent we sell or take actions that reduce the value of the collateral securing the Notes, it will reduce the pool of
assets securing the Notes and the related guarantees.

**_Even though the holders of the Notes benefit from a pari passu lien on the collateral that secures our New_**
**_Term Loan Facility, the collateral agent under the New Term Loan Facility initially controls actions with_**
**_respect to that collateral._**

Under the terms of the pari passu intercreditor agreement, at any time that obligations under our New Term

Loan Facility, are outstanding, subject to certain other limitations, any actions that may be taken in respect of the
collateral securing the Notes that is not New ABL Priority Collateral (as defined herein), including the ability to
cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral and to control the conduct of such
proceedings, are at the direction of the holders of indebtedness under our New Term Loan Facility (and if the
New Term Loan Facility is refinanced, the holders of any refinancing indebtedness may accede to these rights)
and neither the trustee nor the collateral agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, has the ability to control or
direct such actions, even if the rights of the holders of the Notes are adversely affected. These lenders may cause
the agent for the New Term Loan Facility (and if the New Term Loan Facility is refinanced, the holders of any
refinancing indebtedness may accede to these rights) to dispose of, release or foreclose on, or take other actions
with respect to the collateral with which holders of the Notes may disagree or that may be contrary to the interest
of holders of the Notes.

In addition, because the lenders under the New Term Loan Facility (and if the New Term Loan Facility is

refinanced, the holders of any refinancing indebtedness may accede to these rights) control the disposition of the
collateral, such holders could decide not to proceed against the collateral that is not the New ABL Priority
Collateral, regardless of whether there is a default under the documents governing such indebtedness or under the
indenture governing the Notes, in such event, subject to certain limited exceptions, and subject to the right of the

48


-----

holders of Notes to commence enforcement actions after a period of 180 days after the occurrence of an event of
default under the indenture governing the Notes, if the Notes represent the largest outstanding principal amount
of indebtedness secured by a pari passu lien on the collateral and the agent under the New Term Loan Facility
(and if the New Term Loan Facility is refinanced, the holders of any refinancing indebtedness may accede to
these rights) is not pursuing an enforcement. If the lenders under the New Term Loan Facility (and if the New
Term Loan Facility is refinanced, the holders of any refinancing indebtedness may accede to these rights) are not
pursuing such enforcement actions, the only remedy available to the holders of the Notes would be to sue for
payment on the Notes and the related guarantees.

In addition, in the event of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, if the lenders under the New Term

Loan Facility desire to permit any amount of debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing, the collateral agent for the
Notes will, subject to certain exceptions, not be permitted to raise any objection to such DIP financing.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the Notes._**

The collateral securing the Notes is subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other

imperfections as may be accepted by the trustee for the Notes and any other creditors that also have the benefit of
first liens on the collateral securing the Notes from time to time. The initial purchasers have neither analyzed the
effect of, nor participated in any negotiations relating to such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could
adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the trustee, as collateral
agent for the Notes, to realize or foreclose on such collateral.

No appraisals of any collateral have been prepared in connection with this offering. The value of the

collateral at any time is dependent on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable
buyers. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the collateral as of the date of this offering
memorandum exceeds the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the assets pledged as
collateral for the Notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to
implement our business strategy, competition and other future trends. In the event that a bankruptcy case is
commenced by or against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and
unpaid interest on the Notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes
from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed.

The security interest of the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, is subject to practical problems

generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the trustee, as collateral
agent for the Notes, may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a
contract. We cannot assure you that the collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot
assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such
assets. Accordingly, the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, may not have the ability to foreclose upon those
assets and the value of the collateral may significantly decrease. The Notes and the related guarantees are
secured, subject to permitted liens, (i) by a first-priority lien in the collateral that secures our New Term Loan
Facility on a first-priority basis (other than accounts receivable, inventory, cash, bank accounts, certain related
assets and proceeds of the foregoing, collectively, the “New ABL Priority Collateral”) (all such collateral, other
than the New ABL Priority Collateral, the “Notes Priority Collateral”) and (ii) a second priority lien on the New
ABL Priority Collateral, and share equally in right of payment with the New Term Loan Facility to the extent of
the value of such collateral securing such New Term Loan Facility. The indenture governing the Notes offered
hereby permits us to incur additional indebtedness secured by a lien that ranks equally with, or in certain
circumstances, senior to the Notes. Any such indebtedness may further limit the recovery from the realization of
the value of such collateral available to satisfy holders of the Notes.

There may not be sufficient collateral to pay off all amounts we may borrow under our New ABL Facility,

New Term Loan Facility, the Notes and additional indebtedness that we may incur that would be secured on the

49


-----

same basis as or senior to the Notes. Liquidating the collateral securing the Notes may not result in proceeds in
an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due under the Notes after also satisfying the obligations to pay any
creditors with prior liens. In addition, we may be required to repay obligations under our New Term Loan
Facility with proceeds from a sale of assets before repaying the Notes. If the proceeds of any sale of collateral are
not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the
proceeds of the sale of the collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against our and
the subsidiary guarantors’ remaining assets.

**_The liens of the holders of the Notes on the New ABL Priority Collateral are subordinated to the New ABL_**
**_Facility to the extent of the value of the New ABL Priority Collateral._**

Borrowings and letters of credit issued under our New ABL Facility are secured by a first priority lien on

the New ABL Priority Collateral and the liens of the holders of the Notes on the New ABL Priority Collateral are
subordinated to the New ABL Facility pursuant to the terms of the New ABL Facility intercreditor agreement.
Therefore, the Notes are effectively junior to obligations outstanding under the New ABL Facility to the extent of
the value of the New ABL Priority Collateral.

**_The collateral securing the Notes may be diluted under certain circumstances._**

The New ABL Priority Collateral that secures the Notes by a second-priority lien secures our obligations

under the New ABL Facility by a first-priority lien. In the future, the New ABL Priority Collateral and the Notes
Priority Collateral may secure on a first-priority basis additional senior indebtedness that we are permitted to
incur. While the New ABL Facility, the New Term Loan Facility and the indentures governing the Notes, the
New Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2022 Notes contain restrictions on our ability to incur debt and liens in the
future, to the extent we do incur any such additional secured debt, your rights to the New ABL Priority Collateral
and the Notes Priority Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the indebtedness secured on a first-priority
basis by the collateral.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which collateral could be_**
**_released automatically without the consent of the holders of the Notes, which could be adverse to holders of_**
**_Notes._**

Under various circumstances, all or a portion of the collateral may be released, including:

   - to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the

indenture, including the sale of any entity in its entirety that owns or holds such collateral; and

   - with respect to collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee; and

   - upon any release in connection with a foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to that collateral

directed by the collateral agent under our New Term Loan Facility during any period that such collateral
agent controls actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the pari passu intercreditor agreement.
Even though the holders of the Notes share ratably with the lenders under our New Term Loan Facility,
the collateral agent under our New Term Loan Facility initially controls actions with respect to the
collateral, whether or not the holders of the Notes agree or disagree with those actions. See “—Risks
Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Even though the holders of the Notes benefit from a pari
passu lien on the collateral that secures our New Term Loan Facility, the collateral agent under the New
Term Loan Facility initially control actions with respect to that collateral”; and

   - upon any release in connection with a foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to the New ABL

Priority Collateral directed by the collateral agent under our New ABL Facility. The collateral agent under
our New ABL Facility controls actions with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, whether or not the
holders of the Notes agree or disagree with those actions. See “—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and
the Notes—The liens of the holders of the Notes on the New ABL Priority Collateral are subordinated to
the New ABL Facility to the extent of the value of the New ABL Priority Collateral.”

-----

Our subsidiaries that guarantee the New Term Loan Facility or incur or guarantee certain other indebtedness

are required to be subsidiary guarantors and guarantee the Notes. The guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor will
be released in connection with a sale of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the
indenture. The indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a
guarantor of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted
subsidiary, all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any
guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture.
Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral with respect to the
Notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In
addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a structurally senior claim on
the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries. See “Description of the Notes.”

**_Security over certain collateral may not be in place prior to closing, may not be perfected prior to closing and_**
**_may be invalidated following closing, and we will not obtain mortgage title insurance policies at the time of_**
**_issuance of the notes or updated surveys._**

The security interests in certain collateral securing the Notes and guarantees may not be in place or

perfected on the closing date of this offering. For example, we do not expect that liens on mortgages on the real
property owned by us or our subsidiaries and intended to secure the Notes and the guarantees will be in place at
the time of the issuance of the Notes. The real properties intended to be mortgaged may constitute a significant
portion of the value of the collateral intended to secure the Notes and the guarantees.

To the extent any security interest in the collateral securing the notes and guarantees is required to be

perfected and cannot be perfected on or prior to the closing date, the indenture governing the notes will require us
to use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected, to the extent required by
the indenture governing the notes and the security documents, promptly, and in any event within 120 days,
following the issue date (unless the corresponding date for delivering such collateral under the New Term Loan
Facility is extended, in which case the corresponding date for delivery of the collateral securing the notes shall be
automatically extended). If we, or any guarantor, were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, any liens
recorded or perfected after the issue date would face a greater risk of being invalidated than if they had been
recorded or perfected on the issue date, and there will be no assurance prior to issuance of the Notes that all
properties contemplated to be mortgaged as security for the Notes will be mortgaged, and any failure to deliver
such mortgages, or any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery of such mortgages,
may impact the value of the collateral. Liens recorded or perfected after the closing date may be treated under
bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings
commenced within 90 days of lien perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing debt is materially more
likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue
date. Accordingly, if we or a guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the
outstanding notes and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy
proceeding, or not yet perfected at all, the liens securing the Notes may be especially subject to challenge as a
result of having not been perfected before the closing date. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, you
would lose the benefit of the security that the collateral was intended to provide.

Furthermore, no surveys or title insurance have been or will be delivered as to such real properties at the

time of issuance of the Notes. As a result, there is and will be no independent assurance that, among other things,
(i) the real property encumbered by the mortgages includes all of the property owned by us and our guarantors
that we intend to include, (ii) that our title to such owned or leased real property is not encumbered by liens and
other defects not permitted by the indenture and (iii) no unpaid taxes, encroachments, adverse possession claims,
zoning or other restrictions exist with respect to such owned or leased real properties which could result in a
material adverse effect on the value or utility of such owned or leased real properties.

51


-----

**_State law may limit the ability of the collateral agent and the holders of the Notes to foreclose on real property_**
**_and improvements included in the collateral._**

The Notes will be secured by, among other things, liens on certain real property owned by the issuer or

certain subsidiary guarantors and improvements. Liens on after-acquired real estate owned by certain Guarantors
and improvements may not be created in certain jurisdictions where our real property that is subject to mortgages
is located unless the appropriate security document is amended to include such real property. Applicable laws
may also limit the ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on the improved real property collateral.
Furthermore, applicable laws that govern the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure of mortgage liens against
real property which secure debt obligations such as the Notes may impose procedural requirements for
foreclosure differing from and necessitating a longer time period for completion than the requirements for
foreclosure of security interest in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even
if it has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a right of redemption
after foreclosure. Applicable law may also impose security first and one form of action rules, which rules can
affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property collateral regardless of
the location of the collateral and may limit the right to recover a deficiency following a foreclosure.

The holders of the Notes and the Trustee also may be limited in their ability to enforce a breach of the

covenant pertaining to liens. Some decisions of certain state courts have placed limits on a lender’s ability to
accelerate debt as a result of a breach of this type of a covenant. Under these decisions, a lender seeking to
accelerate debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens
or leasehold estates may need to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against
impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default.

Although the foregoing court decisions may have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal laws,

the scope of such preemption, if any, is uncertain. Accordingly, a court could prevent the Trustee and the holders
of the Notes from declaring a default and accelerating the Notes by reason of a breach of this covenant, which
could have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders to enforce the covenant.

**_Our ability to use and operate certain portions of our facilities may be limited by the validity of, or a default or_**
**_termination under, our real property leases and your ability to recover as a secured creditor may be affected by_**
**_a default or termination under such leases, as well as the fact that you will not have leasehold mortgages on_**
**_such leases._**

Certain portions of our facilities are leased from third party landlords, and we expect to lease facilities in the

future. Mortgages on these leased facilities will not be part of the security for the Notes. In addition, the
invalidity of, or default or termination under, any of our leases may interfere with our ability to use and operate
all or a portion of certain of our facilities, which may have an adverse impact on our operations and financial
results.

**_Your rights in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in collateral_**
**_or record mortgages._**

Applicable law provides that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly

perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens in the
collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of such Notes if the trustee, as
collateral agent for the Notes, is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens or if mortgages
are not recorded. In addition, applicable law provides that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a
general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate of title and certain proceeds, can
only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The issuer and the subsidiary
guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the noteholders’ security interest in specified collateral. There can
be no assurance that the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, will monitor, or that we will inform the trustee
of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be

52


-----

taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The trustee, as collateral agent for
the Notes, has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or
the perfection of any security interest. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the collateral
or the priority of the security interest in favor of the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, as applicable,
against third parties.

**_Bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize value from the collateral._**

The right of the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, to repossess and dispose of the collateral upon the

occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes is likely to be significantly impaired
by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against us before the trustee, as
collateral agent for the Notes, repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Upon the commencement of a case
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), a secured creditor such as the trustee, as the collateral
agent for the Notes, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from
disposing of security repossessed from such debtor, without bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given.
Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor
is in default nder the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate
protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is
intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral as of the commencement
of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security if and at such times
as the bankruptcy court in its discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the
collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a
secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the
collateral exceeds the debt it secures.

In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary

power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

   - how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case;

   - whether or when the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, could repossess or dispose of the collateral;

   - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition; or

   - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of

value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.”

Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require permission from the

bankruptcy court.

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of us or any of the guarantors, holders of the Notes may be deemed to have an_**
**_unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the Notes exceed the Notes’ share of the fair_**
**_market value of the collateral securing the Notes._**

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to us or any of the guarantors, it is possible that the bankruptcy

trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the collateral with
respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the
Notes and other obligations secured on a pari passu basis. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the Notes
are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated
between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of
security in the collateral. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would be, among other
things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the Notes to receive post-petition interest and a lack of entitlement on
the part of the unsecured portion of the Notes to receive other “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy
laws. In addition, if any payments of postpetition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal
amount of the secured claim with respect to the Notes.

53


-----

**_The Notes’ share of the value of the collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to secure post-petition_**
**_interest._**

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding against us,

holders of the Notes and other obligations secured on a pari passu basis may only be entitled to post-petition
interest under the Bankruptcy Code to the extent that the value of their share of the Notes Priority Collateral, and
any ABL Priority Collateral that is in excess of obligations under the New ABL Facility (including any postpetition interest payable thereunder), is greater than their pre-bankruptcy claim. Holders of the Notes and other
obligations secured on a pari passu basis that have a security interest in such collateral with a value equal or less
than their pre-bankruptcy claim will not be entitled to post-petition interest under the Bankruptcy Code. No
appraisal of the fair market value of the collateral has been prepared in connection with this offering and we
therefore cannot assure you that the value of the noteholders’ interest in the collateral equals or exceeds the
principal amount of the Notes.

**_Any future pledge of collateral might be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Any future pledge of collateral in favor of the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, for the holders of the

Notes, might be avoidable by the pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy if certain events
or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the pledgor is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the
pledge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a
bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge, or, in certain
circumstances, a longer period.

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks and environmental liabilities._**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary

for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable,
in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or
partial loss of any of the pledged collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the
secured obligations, including obligations under the New Term Loan Facility, the Notes and the guarantees in
respect thereof.

The trustee, as collateral agent for the notes, may be unable to or may decline to foreclose on such collateral

or exercise remedies available in respect thereof based on certain environmental laws or extraordinary costs
associated with hazardous substances if it does not receive indemnification to its satisfaction from the holders of
the Notes.

**_Claims of noteholders will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries_**
**_that will not guarantee the Notes._**

The Notes are not guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries, including certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or

non-wholly owned subsidiaries. Accordingly, claims of holders of the Notes are structurally subordinated to the
claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors. All obligations of our nonguarantor subsidiaries will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available
for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the Notes.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 35% of

our pro forma combined sales and 32% of our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, these nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 19% of our pro forma combined total assets and $174.5
million, or 6% of our pro forma combined total liabilities as of December 31, 2015.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase

all Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for any such

54


-----

purchase of the Notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other
sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes
upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the notes that
are tendered upon a change of control. Further, we will be contractually restricted under the terms of our New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities from repurchasing all of the notes tendered by holders upon a change of control.
Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to purchase the Notes unless we are able to refinance
or obtain waivers under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a
change of control would cause a default under the indenture governing the Notes and a cross-default under the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will also provide that a change
of control will be a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of our
future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.

**_Holders of Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_Notes repurchased by us has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

A change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Notes, requires us to make an offer to

repurchase all outstanding notes. The definition of change of control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease
or transfer of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to repurchase
its Notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of our assets to another individual, group or entity
may be uncertain.

**_The lenders under the New Term Loan Facility will have the discretion to release any future guarantors under_**
**_the Senior Term Loan Facility in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released_**
**_from their guarantees of the Notes._**

While any obligations under the New Term Loan Facility remain outstanding, subject to the terms of

applicable intercreditor agreements and/or security documents, any guarantee of the Notes may be released
without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the trustee under the indenture governing the Notes,
at the discretion of lenders under the New Term Loan Facility, if the relevant guarantor is no longer a guarantor
of obligations under the New Term Loan Facility or any other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—
Guarantees.” The lenders under the New Term Loan Facility will have the discretion to release the guarantees
under the New Term Loan Facility in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against
any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the Notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including
trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively and structurally be senior to
claims of noteholders.

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Notes or any guarantees, and, if that_**
**_occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes._**

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Notes and the

incurrence of the guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent
transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes or any guarantees could be voided as
a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if (i) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, issued the Notes or incurred
the guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) we or any of the guarantors, as
applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the
Notes or incurring the guarantees and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:

   - we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance

of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees;

   - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees left us or any of the guarantors, as applicable,

with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business;

55


-----

   - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond

our or such guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature; or

   - we or any of the guarantors was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for

money damages docketed against us or such guarantor if, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment
is unsatisfied.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantee was a fraudulent

transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or such guarantee, or
subordinate the Notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related
guarantor, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received. In the event of a finding that a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any payment on the Notes. As a general matter,
value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred
or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A debtor will generally not be considered to have received value in
connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or
otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor.

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors

were solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the Notes or the guarantees
would not be subordinated to our or any of our guarantors’ other debt.

**_Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the_**
**_Notes under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes_**
**_without registration under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under U.S. and applicable

state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes. The holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to require us to register the Notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes
in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the
United States and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for
an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active_**
**_trading market for the Notes may not develop._**

The Notes are new issues of securities for which there is no established public market. We do not intend to

have the Notes or any exchange Notes listed on a national securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any
automated dealer quotation systems.

The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, and the exchange

Notes, if issued, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated
to make a market in any of the Notes or the exchanges notes, and they may discontinue their market-making
activities at any time without notice.

Therefore, an active market for any of the Notes or exchange Notes may not develop, and if a market for

any of the Notes or exchange notes does develop, that market may not continue. Historically, the market for
noninvestment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of
securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for any of the Notes or exchange notes may be subject to
similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your Notes.
In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes or exchange notes may trade at a discount from their
initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and
other factors.

**_We are indirectly owned and controlled by CCMP and INEOS, and their interests as equity holders may_**
**_conflict with those of our note holders._**

Following the consummation of the Business Combination, representatives of CCMP and INEOS will

occupy a majority of the seats on our Board of Directors. Accordingly, CCMP and INEOS will have the ability to
control our policies and operations. CCMP and INEOS will not have any liability for any obligations under the
Notes and the interests of CCMP and INEOS could conflict with your interests as noteholders. For example, if
we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of CCMP and
INEOS as equity holders might conflict with your interests as a note holder. CCMP and INEOS may also have an
interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that could, in their judgment,
enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a noteholder. In
addition, CCMP and INEOS may in the future own businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us. CCMP
and INEOS may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a
result, those acquisition opportunities may no longer be available to us. See “Certain Relationships and Related
Party Transactions” and “Principal Stockholders.”

**_Changes in credit ratings issued by statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing_**
**_and the market price of the Notes._**

Credit rating agencies rate the Notes and our other indebtedness on factors that include our results of

operations, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general
outlook for the economy as a whole. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or
downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the
credit rating of the Notes or our other indebtedness or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading
could limit our ability to refinance maturing liabilities, access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs,
increase our cost of financing and lower the market price or liquidity of the Notes. Credit ratings are not
recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the Notes. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential
effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the Notes. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would
make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially
assigned to the Notes is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your
Notes at a favorable price or at all.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture will not apply if the Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s_**
**_and Standard & Poor’s._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture will not apply to us if the Notes are rated investment grade by both

Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions, incur debt and to enter
into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade or, if
they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain these ratings. Suspension of these covenants would
allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force. To the
extent the covenants are subsequently reinstated, any such action taken while the covenants were suspended
would not result in an event of default under the indenture. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Covenant Suspension.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We intend to use net proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings under the New Term Loan

Facility and the New ABL Facility (if any) and the proceeds of the New Senior Unsecured Notes and cash on
hand, to (i) repay the Eco Term Facility and any amounts outstanding under the Eco Revolving Facility,
(ii) repay the Existing PQ Term Facility and any amounts outstanding under the Existing PQ Revolving Facility
and (iii) redeem the 2018 Notes.

The following table summarizes the estimated sources of funds and uses of funds in connection with the

Business Combination and associated refinancing. The amounts in the table below are based on estimated
amounts outstanding on December 31, 2015. Actual amounts outstanding on the closing date of the Business

(1) The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are expected to be comprised of a $1,200 million new term loan
facility (the “New Term Loan Facility”) consisting of a $900 million U.S. dollar-denominated tranche and a
$300 million Euro-denominated tranche, all of which will be outstanding on the closing date of the Business
Combination, and a new ABL facility (the “New ABL Facility”), which provides for an aggregate principal
amount of $200 million of asset-based loans, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. We are
permitted to draw on the New ABL Facility on the closing date of the Business Combination in an aggregate
principal amount up to $75 million to finance the Business Combination or for working capital needs. Based
on estimated working capital needs as of the closing date of the Business Combination, we expect to have
$44 million outstanding on the New ABL Facility at the closing of this offering. We also have the option to
add one or more incremental facilities under (i) the agreement governing our New Term Loan Facility in an
aggregate amount of up to $200 million plus an unlimited additional amount so long as after giving pro
forma effect to the incurrence of such additional amount, we are in compliance with certain leverage ratios
and (ii) the agreement governing our New ABL Facility in an aggregate amount of up to $50 million plus an
additional amount equal to the excess of the borrowing base over the then existing commitments so long as
after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such additional amount, we are in compliance with certain
leverage ratios. Amounts shown exclude any offering discounts. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.”

(2) We expect to issue $625.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a concurrent private placement. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior Unsecured Notes.”

(3) Includes $26 million of premium relating to the redemption of the 2018 Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the
indenture governing the 2018 Notes, the 2018 Notes will be redeemed at 104.375% of the aggregate
principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or otherwise
satisfied and discharged as of the closing date of the Business Combination.

(4) Consists of our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Business Combination, including
placement fees, initial purchaser discounts and commissions, arranging fees and other financing fees and
other transaction costs and advisory and professional fees.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been derived by applying

pro forma adjustments to the historical audited consolidated financial statements of Eco and PQ Holdings
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as
of December 31, 2015 gives effect to the Business Combination and related financing transactions as if they had
occurred on December 31, 2015. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year
ended December 31, 2015 gives effect to the Business Combination and related refinancing transactions as if
they occurred on January 1, 2015. We describe the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments in the
accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with these unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that are

factually supportable and that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements are presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements do not represent what our actual consolidated results of
operations or the consolidated financial condition would have been had the Business Combination and related
refinancing transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future
consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Presentation of
Financial Information,” “Summary—The Business Combination,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of
Eco,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of PQ Holdings,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Eco,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations of PQ Holdings” and the consolidated financial statements and the notes
thereto of each of Eco and PQ Holdings included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. All pro forma
adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to our unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflecting the Business Combination and related refinancing

transactions will be based upon the acquisition method of accounting and upon the assumptions set forth in the
notes included in this section. The unaudited pro forma adjustments and allocation of the excess acquisition
purchase price over the tangible and intangible net assets acquired to intangible assets and goodwill are
preliminary and based on management’s best estimate of the fair value of intangible assets acquired relating to
the Business Combination. The final purchase price allocation for the Business Combination is dependent on,
among other things, the finalization of asset and liability valuations. As of the date of this offering memorandum,
we have not completed the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the purchase price for the Business Combination. We have
allocated the total estimated purchase price for the Business Combination, calculated as described in Note 1
under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on preliminary estimates of their fair values. In arriving at the estimated fair market values, the
Company has considered many factors, including but not limited to, the appraisals by independent consultants
which were based on a preliminary and limited review of the assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be
assumed. There are no assurances that the final estimate of fair market values of the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities will not be materially different from the estimated fair market values thereof once a more detailed and
thorough review of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is performed. The final valuation will be based on the
actual net tangible and intangible assets that exist as of the closing date. Final adjustments will change the
allocations of purchase price, which will affect the fair value assigned to certain assets acquired and liabilities
assumed and will result in a change to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements,
including a change to goodwill. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and
the differences may be material.

**NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET**

**(Unaudited)**

**(dollars in thousands)**

**Basis of Presentation and Description of Transactions**

On August 18, 2015, Eco and PQ Holdings announced a definitive agreement (the “Business Combination

Agreement”) pursuant to which Eco and PQ Holdings will reorganize under New Holdings. PQ’s existing indirect
shareholders, affiliates of CCMP, affiliates of INEOS and PQ’s management) and Eco’s existing indirect equity
holders (affiliates of CCMP and Eco’s management) will constitute the stockholders of New Holdings immediately
following the closing of the Business Combination. The Business Combination will be effected as an equity-forequity transaction. The completion of the Business Combination is subject to certain closing conditions that are
customary for transactions of this type, including regulatory clearance, which has been received. The Business
Combination is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Eco is the
accounting predecessor to New Holdings, as PQ was acquired by CCMP subsequent to CCMP’s acquisition of Eco,
therefore Eco is deemed to be the accounting acquirer.

The historical balance sheet data of each of Eco and PQ Holdings as of December 31, 2015 and the

historical statement of income data for the year ended December 31, 2015 of each of Eco and PQ Holdings are
derived from the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to the potential

impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may
result from the above transactions. Further, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
does not include any other transactions since December 31, 2015.

(1) Reflects the pro forma debt financing in connection with the Business Combination. The amounts reflect the
issuance of $1,200,000 under the New Term Loan Facility, the issuance of $500,000 of Notes offered
hereby, the issuance of $625,000 of the New Senior Unsecured Notes, the repayment of $1,197,950 under
the existing PQ Term Facility and $495,000 under the Eco Term Facility and the redemption of the
$600,000 2018 Notes. The $70,502 of deferred financing and original issue discount (“OID”) represents
deferred financing fees on existing Eco debt that was not written off, additional fees associated with the
issuance of the new debt, net of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and OID of the debt
repaid in connection with the Business Combination. The cash used from the balance sheet as part of the
sources and uses of the transaction is $57,098 resulting from the gross proceeds of $2,325,000 less
repayments of $2,292,950 of existing debt, $62,848 of deferred financing and OID, and the call premium
relating to the 2018 Notes of $26,300. Debt components and the adjustments are detailed below:

For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, the purchase

price is allocated to PQ Holdings’ assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2015 based on
preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Final allocation of the purchase price will be
based on the actual fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed following the completion of the
Business Combination. Accordingly, the value of the assets and liabilities included in the table above is
preliminary and is subject to change pending additional information that may become known to us. An increased
portion of the purchase price allocated to inventory, property, plant and equipment, other assets or liabilities or to
identifiable intangible assets will reduce the amount of purchase price allocated to goodwill in the unaudited
condensed combined financial information and may result in increased depreciation and/or amortization expense.

(3) Represents the change in deferred taxes of $259,160 associated with the purchase price allocation as of
December 31, 2015 using the statutory rates in the applicable jurisdictions. As the Business Combination is
an equity-for-equity transaction, the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities may not equal.

(4) Represents an adjustment to deferred tax liability ($3,077) to record the tax provision on Eco to reflect the
change in tax status as a partnership to a corporation under PQ Corporation.

**SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA OF ECO**

The following tables set forth certain selected historical consolidated financial data as of and for the periods

indicated for Eco. The consolidated statements of operations data and other financial data for the years ended
December 31, 2014 and 2015 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 were
derived from Eco’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

On September 7, 2011, the stock of Rhodia Inc. was acquired by Solvay SA (the “Rhodia Acquisition”). In

connection with the Rhodia Acquisition, the acquisition method of accounting was applied and Eco’s assets and
liabilities were adjusted to fair value on September 7, 2011. As a result of the application of the acquisition
method of accounting, Eco’s financial statement presentations distinguish between a predecessor period prior to
the Rhodia Acquisition and a successor period subsequent to the Rhodia Acquisition (“Predecessor”). The
Predecessor applied acquisition accounting and its financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting that is
based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of September 7, 2011. The financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2011 in the tables below is presented on a combined basis. We
believe that presentation on a combined basis is meaningful as it allows the financial data to be analyzed to
comparable subsequent periods.

On December 1, 2014, substantially all of the assets of Solvay USA Inc.’s Eco Services business unit were

acquired by Eco Services Operations LLC, an indirect subsidiary of funds controlled by CCMP. In connection
with the 2014 Acquisition, the acquisition method of accounting was applied and the assets and liabilities of Eco
were adjusted to fair value on December 1, 2014. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of
accounting, Eco’s financial statement presentations distinguish between a predecessor period prior to the 2014
Acquisition and a successor period subsequent to the 2014 Acquisition. The Successor applied acquisition
accounting and its financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting that is based on the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 1, 2014. The financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2014 in the tables below is presented on a combined basis and is not in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The combined basis results were aggregated from the results of the Predecessor and Successor for the
related periods. We believe that presentation on a combined basis is meaningful as it allows the financial data to
be analyzed to comparable subsequent periods.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND**

**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF PQ HOLDINGS**

_The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers periods_

_prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. Accordingly, the discussion and analysis of historical_
_periods does not reflect the significant impact the Business Combination will have on PQ’s business, including_
_without limitation, the impact of acquisition accounting and debt service requirements as described below. You_
_should read the following discussion of PQ’s financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with_
_“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of_
_PQ Holdings,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of Eco,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Eco” and the historical consolidated financial statements of_
_PQ Holdings and Eco and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. This discussion_
_contains forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our_
_forward-looking statements for various reasons, including those discussed in the “Risk Factors” and_
_“Cautionary Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of this offering memorandum. We do_
_not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements included in this offering memorandum._

**Overview**

We are a leading integrated global innovator and manufacturer of specialty inorganic performance

chemicals, specialty catalysts and specialty glass materials. We believe we are a leader in each of our businesses,
holding what we estimate to be a number one or two supply share position for the year ended December 31, 2015
for greater than 90% of the products we produced, based on volume, in North America, EMEA or Asia, as
applicable, where the respective products are sold. Customers use our products as a critical component for a
broad range of applications including catalysts to address emissions control in automotive catalytic converters,
silica-based additives to enhance teeth whitening performance in toothpaste, silica gels used in beer clarification
as well as specialty products used in completion and cementing fluids for oil field applications. We are at the
forefront of our industry and continue to develop innovative solutions to meet customers’ productivity,
environmental and profitability objectives.

We conduct operations through three principal businesses: Performance Chemicals: a fully integrated,

global leader in silicate technology, producing sodium silicate, specialty silicas, zeolites, spray dry silicates,
magnesium silicate, and other high performance chemical products used in a variety of end-uses such as
adsorbents for surface coatings, clarifying agents for beverages, cleaning and personal care products; Catalysts:
an integrated silica catalyst and specialty zeolite-based catalyst producer with leading global supply share
positions, producing silica catalyst used in the production of HDPE, and specialty zeolite-based catalysts sold to
the emissions control industry, the petrochemical industry and other areas of the broader chemicals industry; and
Specialty Glass Materials: a leading global producer of engineered glass products for use in highway safety,
polymer additives, metal finishing and electronics end-uses, which is comprised of Highway Safety and EGM.
Highway Safety manufactures glass beads used for airport, highway and road safety applications to improve
visibility in wet and nighttime driving conditions, where EGM produces solid and hollow glass spheres for use as
polymer additives and fillers in specialized plastics, as engineered peening beads in metal finishing and as
conductives in consumer electronics and other applications. We sell our products to over 4,000 customers across
20 major end-uses globally from our 68 manufacturing facilities, which are strategically located across six
continents.

**Description of Key Financial Statement Line Items and Key Performance Indicators**

**_Sales_**

Our Performance Chemicals business sales have grown consistently due to growth in the end-uses in which

we operate and new product commercialization. Expansions into new end-uses, as well as gains in our supply
positions for existing end-uses, have also added to the growth of our sales. We have historically experienced
relatively stable demand both seasonally and throughout economic cycles for our Performance Chemicals
business due to our diverse consumer and industrial end-uses. Sales of our Performance Chemicals business are
made on both a purchase order basis and pursuant to long-term contracts.

75


-----

Our Catalysts business sales have grown primarily due to expansion into new end-uses as well as continued

gains our supply positions for existing end-uses. Sales of our Catalysts business products are made on both a
purchase order basis and pursuant to long-term contracts.

Specialty Glass Materials sales have been driven by the growth of spending on repair, maintenance and

upgrade of existing highways and the construction of new highways and roads by governments around the world.
Sales of Specialty Glass Materials products are made principally on a purchase order basis. Within the Specialty
Glass Materials business, sales to the Transportation Safety sector have historically experienced seasonal
fluctuations, particularly in North America and Europe. EGM sales have been driven by the growth in gas and oil
exploration, mining emulsions and light manufacturing. Sales of EGM products are made principally on a
purchase order basis. There may be modest fluctuations in timing of orders, but orders are mainly driven by the
overall economy.

**_Cost of Goods Sold_**

Cost of goods sold consists of variable product costs, fixed manufacturing expenses, depreciation expense

and freight expenses. Variable product costs include all raw materials, energy and packaging costs that are
directly related to the manufacturing process. Fixed manufacturing expenses include all plant employment costs,
manufacturing overhead and periodic maintenance costs. The major raw materials that we use include soda ash,
sand, ATH, and glass cullet. The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of the Performance Chemicals
products are soda ash, industrial sand, ATH and sodium hydroxide. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, approximately 45% of our contracts with our largest Performance Chemicals customers in
North America include price adjustments for changes in the price of raw materials and natural gas. Under these
contracts, there generally is a time lag of three to nine months for price changes to pass-through, depending on
the magnitude of the cost change and general industry conditions. The primary raw materials for the Catalysts
business are sodium silicate, acids, bases and certain metals. The key raw material for the Specialty Glass
Materials business is cullet, or recycled glass. Our primary energy cost in our Performance Chemicals, Catalysts
and Specialty Glass Materials businesses is natural gas.

**_Joint Ventures_**

We account for our investments in our equity joint ventures under the equity method. Our largest joint

venture, Zeolyst International, manufactures high performance specialty zeolite-based catalysts for use in the
emissions control industry, the petrochemical industry and other areas of the broader chemicals industry. We
share proportionally with our joint venture partners in the management of Zeolyst International and other joint
ventures.

**_Industry_**

We are an integrated producer of value-added products throughout the silicates supply chain and believe we

are a recognized leader in sodium silicate, high performance silicate derivatives, specialty catalysts and
engineered glass products. We are a global manufacturer and supplier of our products and have leading supply
share positions across our portfolio of products. In addition, we believe our Catalysts business benefits from our
proprietary technologies, the sole-sourced supply arrangements we have in place with many of our customers and
the favorable trends that support the end-uses our products target.

The catalyst products sold by the Catalyst joint ventures are used by customers in their manufacturing

processes, and the effectiveness of certain of the catalysts diminishes with use, requiring them to be replaced
based on production rates. The sales of these catalysts, therefore, are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of
the catalysts in the manufacturing processes and may vary materially by quarter or by year, creating periodic
unevenness in sales and related unevenness in income from equity method investments.

76


-----

**_Seasonality_**

We experience some seasonality, primarily with respect to our Transportation Safety products of our

Specialty Glass Materials business. As the road striping season occurs during warmer weather, sales and earnings
are primarily generated during the second and third quarters. Working capital is built during the first half of the
year, while cash generation occurs primarily in the second half of the fiscal year.

**_Inflation_**

Inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on us, impacting raw material costs and other operating

costs, as well as resulting in higher fixed asset replacement costs. We attempt to manage these impacts with cost
control, productivity improvements and contractual arrangements, as well as price increases to customers.

**Foreign Currency**

As a global business, we are subject to the impact of gains and losses on currency translations, which occur

when the financial statements of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. We operate a geographically
diverse business with approximately 53% and 56% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively, coming from our international operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because
consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, sales or earnings generated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales and earnings when
translated to U.S. dollars. The foreign currencies to which we have the most significant exchange rate exposure
include the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the Mexican peso.

**Impact of the Business Combination**

**_Overview_**

On August 17, 2015, we entered into the Reorganization Agreement pursuant to which, subject to the terms

and conditions set forth therein, we agreed to consummate a series of transactions to reorganize and combine the
businesses of PQ and Eco under a new holding company. This Business Combination is more fully described
below under “Summary—The Business Combination.”

**_Effects on Our Financial Statements—Acquisition Accounting._**

Our financial statements in the future will vary in important respects from the historical consolidated

financial statements contained in this offering memorandum. The Business Combination will be accounted for
using the acquisition method of accounting. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Eco is considered the accounting
predecessor. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” and “Selected Consolidated
Financial Data of PQ Holdings,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of Eco” and the accompanying notes
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Cost Saving Opportunities_**

We have identified $21.7 million in synergies and cost savings associated with the Business Combination.

We anticipate spending $5.9 million to achieve $4.4 million in annual run-rate cost savings related to Eco’s
overhead costs by the end of 2017, primarily consisting of consolidation synergies, insurance savings and
reductions in Sales, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) spending. We intend to (i) invest $7.5 million in
manufacturing improvements relating to Eco, which we currently expect to yield $8.1 million in annual run-rate
cost savings by the end of 2017 and (ii) invest an additional $16.6 million in PQ’s fixed and variable cost
programs, which we currently expect to yield $9.2 million in annual run-rate cost savings by the end of 2017.

**Results of Operations**

**Year Ended December 31, 2015 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014**

**_Highlights_**

The following is a summary of our financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared

with the prior year ended December 31, 2014.

   - Net sales decreased $90.6 million to $1,024.3 million. The decrease in sales was primarily due to

unfavorable foreign currency exchange variations compared to the same period in the prior year ($96.3
million) and to lower volumes in Performance Chemicals and Potters, partially offset by higher average
selling price and customer mix improvement. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange
impact, net sales increased $5.7 million, or 0.5%.

   - Gross profit decreased $20.8 million to $275.6 million. Our decrease in gross profit was driven primarily

by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation ($26.0 million). Pricing was strong across nearly
all businesses to cover increases in manufacturing costs, depreciation expense and unfavorable product
mix. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, gross profit increased $5.2 million, or
1.8%.

   - Operating income increased $2.6 million to $117.0 million. Our operating income increased due to lower

selling, general & administrative, or SG&A, expense and a decrease in other operating expenses, partially
offset by lower gross profit as described above.

   - Equity in net income of affiliated companies, net was $45.3 million, an increase of $15.9 million. The

increase was due to higher earnings generated by our Catalyst joint ventures, primarily from greater
demand in nearly all product lines, partially offset by various growth related cost increases.

**_Sales_**

Sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,024.3 million, a decrease of $90.6 million, or

8.1%, compared to sales of $1,114.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in sales as
compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency
translation of $96.3 million and lower volumes of $10.2 million, partially offset by greater average selling price
and mix improvements of $15.9 million. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, net sales
increased $5.7 million, or 0.5%.

**_Performance Chemicals_**

Sales in the Performance Chemicals business for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $685.4 million, a

decrease of $79.8 million, or 10.4%, compared to sales of $765.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The decrease in sales, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to the unfavorable
effects of foreign currency translation of $76.4 million and decreased volumes of $10.7 million, partially offset
by and higher average selling price and mix improvements of $7.3 million. Excluding the unfavorable foreign
currency exchange impact, net sales decreased $3.4 million, or 0.4%.

The stronger U.S. dollar compared to a number of other major currencies, including the Brazilian real,

Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Euro, the British pound, unfavorably impacted our sales. The lower
volume is primarily driven by lower zeolite and magnesium sulfate demand, as well as metasilicate and spray dry
sales volumes into the drilling end-uses in the Americas and sodium silicate sales volumes in Europe, partially
offset by increased demand for spray dry silicate for use in automatic dishwasher detergents and zeolite sales
volumes in Europe. The higher average sales price is principally a result of average selling price increases for
higher manufacturing costs under our cost adjusted pass-through contracts in the Americas and favorable U.S.
dollar-denominated pricing in certain foreign locations. Lower pricing in Europe from unfavorable product and
customer mix, slightly offset this favorable pricing impact.

**_Silica Catalyst_**

Sales in the Silica Catalyst business for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $58.2 million, an increase

of $4.2 million, or 7.8%, compared to sales of $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase
in sales, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to increased volumes of $6.8 million
and higher average selling price and mix of $0.7 million, partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign
currency translation of $3.3 million. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, net sales
increased $7.5 million, or 13.9%. The higher volume is primarily driven by strong demand across nearly all of
our product lines, primarily in our chemical catalyst product line serving the methyl methacrylate end-uses and
the product lines serving the HDPE producers. The higher pricing is due to higher pass-through manufacturing
costs in the chemical catalyst product line and to favorable customer mix, partly offset by lower pricing in
various other products.

**_Specialty Glass Materials_**

Sales in the Specialty Glass Materials business for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $291.3 million,

a decrease of $15.9 million, or 5.2%, compared to sales of $307.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $17.5 million and
lower volumes of $6.3 million, partially offset by higher average selling price of $7.9 million. Excluding the
unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, net sales increased $1.6 million, or 0.5%.

The stronger U.S. dollar across certain of our major currencies including the Australian dollar, Canadian

dollar, the Euro, the British pound, Mexican peso and Japanese yen, unfavorably impacted our sales. The

79


-----

unfavorable sales volume was driven by lower volumes in the EGM division, including the hollowspheres,
conductive, metal finishing and spheriglass product lines. Greater demand for other transportation safety division
products in most regions partially offset the lower sales. Pricing increased mainly for transportation safety
division products in the Americas and in certain EGM division product lines, including hollowspheres and
spheriglass. Lower conductive pricing from lower silver pass through costs partially offset the favorable pricing
variance in the EGM division.

**_Cost of Goods Sold_**

Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $748.7 million, a decrease of $69.8 million,

or 8.5%, compared with $818.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in cost of goods
sold was primarily due to the effect of foreign currency translation on our costs of $72.5 million and lower
volume impact of $12.7 million, partially offset by unfavorable product mix impact of $5.2 million, and increases
in manufacturing costs of $2.9 million and depreciation expense of $7.3 million.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $275.6 million, a decrease of $20.8 million, or 7.0%

compared with $296.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gross profit was primarily
due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $26.0 million, higher manufacturing costs of
$2.9 million, higher depreciation expense of $7.3 million, and negative product mix contribution of $3.0 million,
partially offset by higher average selling price of $15.9 million and higher volume contribution of $2.5 million.
Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, gross profit increased $5.2 million, or 1.8%.

**_Performance Chemicals_**

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $173.3 million, a decrease of $23.8 million, or

12.1%, compared with $197.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gross profit was
due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $20.1 million, higher manufacturing costs of
$4.4 million, higher depreciation expense of $3.3 million, and lower volumes of $6.2 million, partially offset by
higher average selling price of $7.3 million and product mix improvement of $2.9 million. Excluding the
unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, gross profit decreased $3.7 million, or 1.9%.

The higher manufacturing costs were primarily driven by higher U.S. dollar-denominated raw material

purchases in foreign entities, inflation costs in the Americas, and higher maintenance and production costs in
Europe. These were partially offset by lower natural gas costs and favorable fixed cost absorption from the
timing of inventory build in the Americas and Europe. The product mix improvements resulted primarily in
Europe from reduced sales of lower margin sodium silicates and increased sales of higher margin spray dry
silicates, partially offset from lower sales of higher margin magnesium sulfate, metasilicate and spray dry
products in the Americas.

**_Silica Catalyst_**

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $19.3 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 18.9%,

compared with $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gross profit was due to
higher manufacturing costs of $6.3 million, higher depreciation expense of $2.3 million, unfavorable product mix
of $0.7 million, and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $1.2 million, partially offset by
higher volumes of $5.3 million and greater average selling price of $0.7 million. Excluding the unfavorable
foreign currency exchange impact, gross profit decreased $3.3 million, or 13.9%. The higher manufacturing costs
were primarily driven by higher pass through raw material variable costs and additional fixed costs from added
expansion capacity and lower fixed cost absorption.

**_Specialty Glass Materials_**

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $83.0 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 9.9%,

compared with $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gross profit was due to
higher volume contribution of $3.4 million, greater average selling price of $7.9 million, and lower
manufacturing costs of $7.8 million, partially offset by unfavorable product mix of $5.2 million, higher
depreciation expense of $1.7 million, and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $4.7 million.
Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, gross profit increased $12.2 million, or 16.2%.

The lower manufacturing costs were primarily driven by lower raw material costs including natural gas,

silver and cullet, reduced shipping costs, and by favorable fixed cost absorption from inventory build of EGM
division products in North America. These were partially offset by higher fixed costs and freight transportation
costs in North America. The favorable volume contribution is from higher shipped volumes of transportation
safety products across most regions, partially offset by lower EGM volume contribution. The unfavorable
product mix resulted primarily from fewer current year sales of higher margin hollowspheres, conductive and
other EGM products and from greater current year sales of lower margin cullet.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $107.1 million, a decrease of $3.8 million, or

3.4%, compared with $110.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the current year, decreases in
employee related costs of $7.0 million and other SG&A related costs were partially offset by $3.4 million stock
compensation for grants issued in 2015.

**_Other Operating Expense_**

Other operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $51.5 million, a decrease of $19.6

million, or 27.6%, compared with $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was
primarily driven by $13.6 million lower transaction-related costs, mainly due to the absence of the sale related
costs incurred in the prior year, $4.0 million other income for the sale of nitrous-oxide gas emissions credits from
one of our plants in our Performance Chemicals business, $3.2 million lower environmental costs, and one-time
demolition costs of one of our non-operating buildings of $2.3 million in 2014. These were partially offset by
$2.9 million increase in severance related costs in 2015 and $0.9 million loss on asset disposals.

**_Equity in Net Income of Affiliated Companies, Net_**

Equity in net income of affiliated companies, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $45.3 million,

an increase of $15.9 million, compared with $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase
was due to higher earnings generated by our Catalyst joint ventures. Favorable demand of hydrocracking,
specialty catalyst, and pressure products (primarily due to emission regulations) was partially offset by the
impact of lower y-powder volumes and various cost increases. Cost drivers include unfavorable inventory
absorption, higher fixed costs and depreciation from expansion, and increased SG&A and research and
development expense. Hydrocracking demand was up primarily due to the timing of re-fills as the products used
in hydrocracking typically have a three to five year life cycle before they must be replaced.

**_Interest expense, Net_**

Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $108.4 million, a decrease of $3.2 million,

compared with $111.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense decreased primarily due
to lower third-party interest expense resulting from our debt repricing in March 2014 and to lower amortization
of the interest cap premium in 2015.

81


-----

**_Debt Extinguishment Costs_**

On March 27, 2014, we re-priced our senior secured term loans to lower the applicable interest rate. We

repaid all outstanding senior secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $1,222.6 million and issued new
senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,222.6 million. As a result of the re-pricing,
previous unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.3 million and original issue discount of $2.2 million
associated with the old debt were written off in 2014.

**_Other (Income) Expense_**

Other expense was $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a favorable change of $2.5 million,

compared with $23.9 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other expense primarily
consisted of foreign currency losses of $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to foreign
currency losses of $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 a favorable change of $2.3 million. The
change in foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven by a strengthening U.S. dollar
on intercompany debt denominated in foreign currencies translated to U.S. dollars. Adding to the favorable
change is $0.2 million of lower other expenses.

**_Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes_**

The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $22.9 million compared with

provision for income taxes of $7.5 million for year ended December 31, 2014. The effective income tax rate for
the year ended December 31, 2015 was 70.4% compared to 129.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our
effective income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, changes in income mix. The difference
between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014 was mainly due to the provision for un-repatriated foreign earnings, the tax effect
of repatriating foreign earnings back to the United States as dividends, differences between tax rates in foreign
jurisdictions as compared to the U.S. tax rate, withholding taxes, non-deductible transaction costs, and the tax
effect of a change in foreign exchange gain/loss recorded in the statement of operations.

**_Net Income (Loss) Attributable to PQ Holdings Inc._**

For the foregoing reasons and after the effect of the non-controlling interest in earnings of subsidiaries for

each period presented, net income attributable to PQ Holdings Inc. was $7.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015 compared with net loss attributable to PQ Holdings Inc. of $3.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014.

**Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013**

**_Highlights_**

The following is a summary of our financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared

with the prior year ended December 31, 2013.

   - Net sales increased $29.9 million to $1,114.9 million. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher

sales volumes and greater average selling price and product mix improvement, partially offset by
unfavorable foreign currency exchange variations compared to the prior year.

   - Gross profit increased $6.8 million to $296.4 million. Our increase in gross profit was driven primarily by

increased pricing and customer mix, and higher volumes, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs
and depreciation, and unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation.

   - Operating income decreased $14.6 million to $114.4 million. Our operating income decreased due to

increase in other operating expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit and slightly lower selling,
general & administrative, or SG&A, expense.

**_Analysis of Results of Operations_**

The following data and discussion provides an analysis of certain significant factors affecting our results of

operations during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.

**_Sales_**

Sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 were $1,114.9 million, an increase of $29.9 million, or

2.8%, compared to sales of $1,085.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in sales as
compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to higher volumes of $38.8 million and greater
average selling price and product mix improvements of $6.8 million, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of
foreign currency translation of $15.7 million.

**_Performance Chemicals_**

Sales in the Performance Chemicals business for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $765.2 million, an

increase of $18.1 million, or 2.4 %, compared to sales of $747.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
The increase in sales, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to increased volumes
of $21.5 million and higher average selling price and mix improvements of $9.5 million, partially offset by the
unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $12.9 million.

The higher volume is primarily driven by greater demand in Performance Chemicals sodium and potassium

silicates, magnesium sulfate, and spray dry silicate volumes in the Americas and sodium silicate, magnesium
silicate, and specialty silicas volumes in Europe. The higher average sales price is principally a result of average
selling price increases for higher manufacturing costs under our cost adjusted pass-through contracts in the
Americas and favorable product mix in EMEA & Asia for certain product lines. Unfavorable customer mix in
sodium silicate in Performance Chemicals slightly offset this favorable pricing impact. The stronger U.S. dollar
compared to a number of other major currencies, including the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real,
and the Australian dollar, unfavorably impacted our sales. This impact is offset partially by a weaker U.S. dollar
compared with the Euro and British pound.

**_Silica Catalyst_**

Sales in the Silica Catalyst business for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $54.0 million, an increase

of $3.1 million, or 6.1 %, compared to sales of $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase
in sales, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to increased volumes of $4.0 million
and favorable effects of foreign currency translation of $0.4 million, partially offset by lower average selling
price and mix of $1.3 million. The higher volume is primarily driven by higher sales across multiple product
lines, while the lower average sales price is principally a result of lower strategic pricing.

**_Specialty Glass Materials_**

Sales in the Specialty Glass Materials business for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $307.2 million,

an increase of $8.4 million, or 2.8 %, compared to sales of $298.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
The increase was primarily due to higher volumes of $13.0 million, partially offset by lower average selling price
and mix of $1.4 million and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $3.2 million.

The higher sales volume was driven by stronger demand in the EGM division including the conductive,

hollowspheres, spheriglass, and metal finishing product lines. The reduced average selling price was driven
primarily from lower silver pass-through pricing in our conductive product line and lower customer mix impact
of hollowsphere sales, partially offset from favorable price increases in the transportation safety division in North
America. The stronger U.S. dollar across certain of our major currencies including the Canadian dollar, Mexican
peso, Australian dollar, and Japanese yen, unfavorably impacted our sales. This impact is offset partially by a
weaker U.S. dollar compared with the Euro and British pound.

83


-----

**_Cost of Goods Sold_**

Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $818.5 million, an increase of $23.1 million,

or 2.9 %, compared with $795.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in cost of goods
sold was primarily due higher volume impact of $31.8 million, and increases in manufacturing costs of $11.2
million and depreciation expense of $3.7 million, partially offset by product mix impact of $11.3 million and the
effect of foreign currency translation on our costs of $12.3 million.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $296.4 million, an increase of $6.8 million, or 2.3 %

compared with $289.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in gross profit was primarily
due to higher average selling price of $6.8 million, higher volume contribution of $7.0 million, and product mix
improvements of $11.3 million, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs of $11.2 million, higher
depreciation expense of $3.7 million, and unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $3.4 million.

**_Performance Chemicals_**

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $197.1 million, an increase of $12.6 million, or

6.8 %, compared with $184.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in gross profit was due
to favorable volume contribution of $9.3 million, higher average selling price of $9.5 million and favorable
product mix of $1.7 million, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs of $3.4 million, higher depreciation
expense of $1.9 million, and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $2.6 million.

The higher manufacturing costs were primarily driven by higher energy costs, interplant freight costs, and

raw material costs in the Performance Chemicals Americas (sand and soda ash), partially offset by lower raw
material costs in Performance Chemicals EMEA (caustic and natural gas).

**_Silica Catalyst_**

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $23.8 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 2.5 %,

compared with $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in gross profit was due to
lower average selling price of $1.3 million, unfavorable product mix of $1.0 million, higher manufacturing costs
of $1.4 million, and higher depreciation expense of $0.2 million, partially offset by favorable volume
contribution of $3.0 million and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation of $0.3 million.

**_Specialty Glass Materials_**

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $75.5 million, a decrease of $5.2 million, or 6.4 %,

compared with $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in gross profit was due to
lower volume contribution of $5.3 million, lower average selling price of $1.4 million, higher manufacturing
costs of $6.4 million, higher depreciation expense of $1.6 million, and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency
translation of $1.1 million, partially offset by product mix improvements of $10.6 million.

The favorable product mix improvements resulted primarily from higher margin hollowsphere and

conductive volumes. The higher manufacturing costs were primarily driven by higher fixed costs and
transportation costs, as well as higher raw material costs of natural gas and cullet.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $110.9 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or

0.3%, compared with $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. SG&A expenses decreased during
the year primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages, bonus plan expense, other compensation, and pension
plan costs, partially offset by increases in professional fees, employee fringe benefit expense, salesman
commissions and other SG&A costs.

84


-----

**_Other Operating Expense_**

Other operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $71.1 million, an increase of $21.7

million, or 43.9 %, compared with $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change was
primarily driven by $18.5 million for transaction costs related to our sale process, increased environmental
reserves of $3.1 million, and one- time demolition costs of one of our non-operating buildings at one of our
facilities of $1.2 million. These were partially offset from the absence of asset impairment charges in 2014 and
other operating income of $0.1 million.

**_Equity in Net Income of Affiliated Companies, Net_**

Equity in net income of affiliated companies, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $29.4 million,

a decrease of $24.4 million, compared with $53.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease
was due to lower earnings generated by our Catalyst joint ventures. The decrease was driven primarily by lower
demand of hydrocracking as well as pressure products used in the production of caprolactam. In addition,
earnings were lower due to higher fixed costs, SG&A and research and development costs, and depreciation
expense. Caprolactam demand was driven by certain customers in Asia Pacific countries. Hydrocracking demand
was down primarily due to the timing of re-fills as the products used in hydrocracking typically have a three to
eight year life cycle before they must be replaced.

**_Interest Expense, Net_**

Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $111.6 million, a decrease of $8.7 million,

compared with $120.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Interest expense decreased primarily due
to lower third-party interest expense resulting from our debt re-pricing in February 2013 and March 2014.

**_Debt Extinguishment Costs_**

On March 27, 2014, we re-priced our senior secured term loans to lower the applicable interest rate. We

repaid all outstanding senior secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $1,222.6 million and issued new
senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,222.6 million. As a result of the re-pricing,
previous unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.3 million and original issue discount of $2.2 million
associated with the old debt were written off.

**_Other (Income) Expense_**

Other expense was $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an unfavorable change of $20.5

million, compared with $3.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2013. Other expense primarily
consisted of foreign currency losses of $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to foreign
currency losses of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an unfavorable change of $19.0 million.
The change in foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven by a strengthening U.S.
dollar on intercompany debt denominated in foreign currencies translated to U.S. dollars. Adding to the
unfavorable change is $1.1 million of third party debt refinancing costs, the lower mark-to-market gains
associated with the assets of our supplemental retirement plan of $0.1 million, and other expenses of $0.3
million.

**_Provision for Income Taxes_**

The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $7.5 million compared with

$10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effective income tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2014 was 129.4% compared to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our effective
income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, changes in income mix. The difference between the
U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014
and 2013 was mainly due to differences between tax rates in foreign jurisdictions as compared to the U.S. tax

rate, the tax effect of repatriating foreign earnings back to the United States as dividends, non-deductible
transaction costs, changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions and changes in valuation allowances against
deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions.

**_Net Income (Loss) Attributable to PQ Holdings Inc._**

For the foregoing reasons and after the effect of the non-controlling interest in earnings of subsidiaries for

each period presented, net loss attributable to PQ Holdings Inc. was $3.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014 compared with net income attributable to PQ Holdings Inc. of $26.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013.

**Historical Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flow from operations, existing cash balances as well as

funds available under the revolving portion of our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We expect that
ongoing requirements for debt service and capital expenditures will be funded from these sources of funds and
the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our primary liquidity requirements include funding working capital
requirements (primarily inventory and accounts receivable, net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities),
debt service requirements and capital expenditures. Historically, our primary capital expenditures have been for
maintenance of business. However, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we spent approximately $77.4 million
in maintenance capital expenditures, which include spending on maintenance of business, cost reduction
initiatives and health, safety and environmental initiatives, and $32.6 million in expansion capital expenditures,
which include spending to drive organic growth.

As of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $1,821.1 million, with up to $144.7 million of

available borrowings under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility, after giving effect to $5.3 million of
outstanding letters of credit. Our liquidity requirements are significant, primarily due to debt service
requirements. Our cash interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and for the year ended
December 31, 2014 was approximately $103.1 and $104.9 million, respectively. A one percent change in
assumed interest rates for our variable interest New Senior Secured Credit Facilities would have an annual
impact of approximately $12.0 million on interest expense.

**Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014**

Net cash provided by operating activities was $98.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015

compared to $120.4 million during the same period in the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash generated by
operating earnings after giving effect to non-cash items recognized in the income statement during the period was
higher during the year ended December 31, 2015 by $15.1 million compared to the same period in the prior year.
Cash used by working capital during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $36.7 million unfavorable
compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Working capital for the year ended December 31, 2015 used
cash of $31.1 million, compared to cash provided of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The change in cash used by working capital of $36.7 million compared to the prior year was primarily due

to unfavorable changes in trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The
unfavorable inventory change was principally the result of planned year-end inventory build and lower current
year hollowsphere product sales in the EGM division for Specialty Glass Materials, higher prior year inventory
depletion in Performance Chemicals EMEA & Asia, and from inventory build in Silica Catalyst. The unfavorable
change in accounts receivable was due primarily to higher current year sales in Silica Catalyst across multiple
products and in the transportation safety products division of Specialty Glass Materials, partly offset by greater
prior year sales in Europe for Performance Chemicals. The change in accounts payable was primarily due to the
timing of current year payments and reduced levels of current year capital expenditures. The change in accrued
liabilities was primarily due to employee compensation and bonus related accruals as well as changes in various
other accruals.

Net cash used in investing activities was $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to

$114.0 million during the same period in 2014. The higher cash used in investing activities compared to the prior
year period was primarily due to the release of $16.9 million restricted cash related to the 2014 New Market Tax
Credit Financing (see “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for further details) and $12.0 million cash used for
an acquisition of certain assets in the Performance Chemicals business, partially offset by lower capital spending
of approximately $17.8 million. The decreased capital spending was primarily due to lower 2015 expansion
capital expenditures in Specialty Glass Materials and Silica Catalysts.

Net cash used in financing activities was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to

net cash used of $14.8 million during the same period in 2014. The change in cash from financing activities was
primarily driven by a $3.3 million equity contribution and by the absence of debt issuance activity in 2015.

**Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013**

Net cash provided by operating activities was $120.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014

compared to $115.9 million during the same period in in the year ended December 31, 2013. Cash generated by
operating earnings after giving effect to non-cash items recognized in the income statement during the period was
lower during the year ended December 31, 2014 by $9.3 million compared to the same period in the prior year.

87


-----

Cash provided/used by working capital during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $13.8 million favorable
compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Working capital for the year ended December 31, 2014
provided cash of $5.6 million, compared to cash use of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The change in cash provided/used by working capital of $13.8 million compared to the prior year was

primarily due to favorable changes in inventory, accrued liabilities, and other, partially offset by unfavorable
changes in prepaids and other current assets, trade accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The favorable
inventory change was principally the result of depletion of higher prior year inventory from greater volume sales
in the EGM division of Specialty Glass Materials and in Europe for Performance Chemicals. Further, favorable
Performance Chemicals inventory change resulted from purchases of raw materials at lower costs in Europe,
partially offset from higher inventory in the Americas as compared to prior year and in the Silica Catalyst
business from planned inventory build. The unfavorable change in accounts payable was primarily due to lower
current year Performance Chemicals raw material pricing in Europe, and from slightly lower current year capital
spend as compared to year-end 2013 in the Americas and Europe, partially offset by the increased level of current
year capital expenditures and the timing of payments in Specialty Glass Materials. The unfavorable change in
accounts receivable was due primarily to greater current year sales across the EGM division of Specialty Glass
Materials, and in Europe and North America for Performance Chemicals.

Net cash used in investing activities was $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to

$125.4 million during the same period in 2013. The lower cash used in investing activities compared to the prior
year period was primarily due to the change of the $16.9 million of restricted cash and the $15.6 million loan
receivable established in 2013, each associated with the New Markets Tax Credit financing arrangement in
Specialty Glass Materials (for further discussion on the New Markets Tax Credit, see “—Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements” below). In addition the Company invested $10.0 million in affiliates in 2014 compared to $18.0
million in 2013. These were partially offset by higher capital spending of approximately $47.7 million compared
to the same period in 2013. The investment in affiliated companies was made to fund the capital expansion in our
Zeolyst C.V. joint venture in both 2013 and 2014. The Company received an offsetting $10.0 million of
dividends in 2014 and $18 million in 2013 of dividends from our Zeolyst International joint venture resulting in
no overall cash impact to the Company. The increased capital spending was primarily due to greater expansion
capital expenditures in Specialty Glass Materials and Silica Catalysts.

Net cash used in financing activities was $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to

net cash provided of $6.9 million during the same period in 2013. The change in cash used by financing activities
was primarily driven by the absence of the New Markets Tax Credit financing arrangement in Specialty Glass
Materials in 2014, and by the change in debt structure, and related increase in required quarterly debt payments.

As of December 31, 2015 our total debt was $1,821.1 million, including $2.2 million of other foreign debt

and $21.0 million of notes payable for the New Markets Tax Credit funding (see “—Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements” for details), and excluding the original issue discount of $13.1 million and related deferred
financing costs of $4.2 million for our senior secured credit facilities. Our net debt was $1,727.1 million,
excluding $2.2 million of other foreign debt, $21.0 million of notes payable, and including cash of $53.5 million.
Our total available liquidity as of December 31, 2015 equals $198.2 million, which represents our cash on hand
of $53.5 million plus our excess availability under our revolving credit facility of $144.7 million, after giving
effect to $5.3 million of outstanding letters of credit.

**_Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities_**

The existing PQ facilities include PQ’s term loan of $1,197.9 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015

with a maturity date of August 7, 2017, and the revolving credit facility with a maturity date of May 8, 2017. As
of December 31, 2015, there was $144.7 million of revolving credit borrowings available under the revolving
credit facility, after giving effect to $5.3 million of outstanding letters of credit.

PQ’s existing term loan facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1.00% per

annum of the original principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity. PQ’s Existing
Senior Secured Credit Facility will be repaid in full and all commitments thereunder will be terminated in
connection with the Business Combination.

**_2018 Notes_**

On November 8, 2012, in connection with the repayment of our former senior secured credit facilities, we

closed the issuance of the 2018 Notes. As of December 31, 2015, we had $600.0 million principal amount of
2018 Notes outstanding, which bear interest at a rate of 8.750% and mature on November 1, 2018. The interest
on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1.

PQ’s obligations under the 2018 Notes are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of the assets

of the issuer and each guarantor, including PQ’s capital stock and the capital stock of all direct domestic
subsidiaries of the issuer and each guarantor (other than any domestic subsidiary, substantially all of the assets of
which constitute the equity of foreign subsidiaries) and 65% of the capital stock of material first-tier foreign
subsidiaries and any domestic subsidiary, substantially all of the assets of which constitute the equity of foreign
subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain exceptions.

The 2018 Notes will be redeemed in full in connection with the Business Combination.

**_New Markets Tax Credits Financing_**

On October 24, 2013, PQ’s indirect subsidiary Potters Industries, LLC (“Potters”), entered into a New

Markets Tax Credit (“NMTC”), financing arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and several of its
affiliates (“Chase”), and TX CDE V LLC, an affiliate of Texas LIC Development Company LLC d/b/a Texas
Community Development Capital (“TX CDE”), whereby Chase agreed to contribute $6.6 million and an
additional $15.6 million in funds lent to Chase by Potters Holdings II, L.P. to TX CDE. TX CDE, in turn, lent
$21.0 million in the form of $5.4 million and $15.6 million notes (the “Loans”), to Potters, which used the
proceeds of the Loans to finance the expansion of Potters’ manufacturing facility in Paris, Texas. The $21.0
million was outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The capital expenditures associated with the NMTC
Agreement were completed in 2014. These Loans are secured by a third lien position behind the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes offered hereby.

**Capital Expenditures**

Maintenance capital expenditures include spending on maintenance of business, cost savings initiatives and

health, safety and environmental initiatives. Expansion capital expenditures include spending to drive organic
sales growth. These capital expenditures represent our “book” capital expenditures for which the Company has
recorded, but not necessarily paid for the capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures remained at a level sufficient for required maintenance and certain expansion growth

initiatives during these periods. Maintenance capital expenditures are higher for the year ended December 31,
2015 due primarily to the timing of furnace rebuild maintenance capital in the Americas and Europe for
Performance Chemicals and additional cost reduction capital across all businesses. Expansion capital
expenditures are lower in the year ended December 31, 2015 due to timing of our expansion projects related to
our strategic growth initiatives, primarily in our Specialty Glass Materials and Silica Catalysts businesses.

**Pension Funding**

We paid $4.6 million and $7.0 million in cash contributions into our defined benefit pension plans and other

post-retirement plans during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The periodic pension
cost was $3.6 million and $1.7 million for those same periods, respectively.

As of December 31, 2015, our pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by

$39.8 million and $14.2 million, respectively. In addition, our supplemental retirement plan had a liability of
$14.1 million, which is funded by our general assets, including assets held in a Rabbi trust of $5.9 million, or
restoration pension plan assets.

**Pro Forma for the Business Combination**

Following the consummation of the Business Combination, the primary source of liquidity will be cash

generated from operations and availability under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other lines of credit.
Our primary uses of cash will be for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures. Following the
consummation of the Business Combination, we will have the following indebtedness outstanding:

**_Senior Secured Credit Facilities_**

Our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be comprised of a 6.5-year $1,200 million term loan facility

consisting of a $900 million U.S. dollar-denominated tranche and a $300 million Euro-denominated tranche, and
a 5-year $200 million asset-based revolving credit facility. The New Term Loan Facility will be fully funded at
the closing of the Business Combination. We are permitted to draw on the New ABL Facility on the closing date
of the Business Combination in an aggregate principal amount up to $75 million to finance the Business
Combination or for working capital needs. Based on estimated working capital needs as of the closing date of the
Business Combination, we expect to have $44 million outstanding on the New ABL Facility at the closing of this
offering. We also have the option to add one or more incremental facilities under (i) the agreement governing our
New Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of up to $200 million plus an unlimited additional amount so
long as after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such additional amount, we are in compliance with
certain leverage ratios and (ii) the agreement governing our New ABL Facility in an aggregate amount of up to

90


-----

$50 million plus an additional amount equal to the excess of the borrowing base over the then existing
commitments so long as after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such additional amount, we are in
compliance with certain leverage ratios. The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will include negative
covenants that will, subject to exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or permit to exist additional
indebtedness (including guarantees thereof); pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or
repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness; incur liens on assets; make certain investments
or other restricted payments; allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to us; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell certain assets or merge or
consolidate with or into other companies; and alter the business that we conduct. For a more detailed description
of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities.”

**_2022 Notes_**

In October 2014, Eco, as issuer together with Eco Finance Corp., as co-issuer, issued $200.0 million

aggregate principal amount of its 8.5% Senior Notes due 2022. The 2022 Notes have a maturity date of
November 2022. The 2022 Notes pay interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each
year. Following the Business Combination, PQ Corporation will assume Eco’s and Eco Finance Corp.’s
obligations under the 2022 Notes and each entity that guarantees PQ Corporation’s obligations under the Term
Loan Facility will guarantee the 2022 Notes. See “—Description of Other Indebtedness.”

**_New Senior Unsecured Notes_**

In connection with the Business Combination, we expect to issue $625 million aggregate principal amount

of New Senior Unsecured Notes in a concurrent private placement. The New Senior Unsecured Notes will
mature on May 1, 2022; provided that if the 2022 Notes have been refinanced or otherwise repaid prior to such
date, the New Senior Unsecured Notes will instead mature on May 2, 2023 and interest on the Notes will be
payable quarterly. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior Unsecured Notes.”

**_Notes Offered Hereby_**

In connection with the Business Combination, we will issue $500 million aggregate principal amount of the

Notes offered hereby. The Notes offered hereby will mature on, 2022 (a date that will be

approximately six and one half years after the date the Notes are issued) and interest on the Notes will be payable
semi-annually on and of each year. For a more detailed description of the Notes offered hereby, see

“Description of the Notes.”

We expect that our primary future cash needs will be debt service, funding working capital requirements and

capital expenditures. We may also pursue strategic acquisition opportunities, which may impact our future cash
requirements. We may, from time to time, increase borrowings under our New ABL Facility to meet our future
cash needs. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to
generate cash in the future. Our management believes that our cash on hand, together with cash from operations
and, if required, borrowings under our New ABL Facility, will be sufficient for our cash requirements for at least
the next twelve months.

**Off—Balance Sheet Arrangements**

**_Industrial Revenue Bond-Financed Tax Abatement_**

On December 18, 2013, PQ Corporation and our joint venture, Zeolyst International, entered into a real

estate tax abatement agreement with the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas that
will utilize an Industrial Revenue Bond financing structure to achieve a 75% real estate tax abatement on the
value of the improvements that will be constructed during the expansion of PQ Corporation’s and Zeolyst
International’s facilities at the jointly-operated Kansas City, Kansas plant over a period of ten years.

weighted average interest rate for the New Term Loan Facility, the New Senior Unsecured Notes and the
Notes offered hereby and assuming the New ABL Facility is undrawn, pro forma cash interest expense
would increase or decrease, as applicable, by $2.3 million.

(c) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally
binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased,
fixed, minimum or variable provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations
exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.

(d) Other obligations represent payments related to our pension plans, supplemental retirement plans, other
post-retirement benefit plans and the INEOS Group liability for potential multi-year UK tax benefits
received. Included in these amounts are expected pension plan contributions of $7.2 million in 2016.
Contributions to the pension plan beyond 2016 cannot be reasonably estimated and are not reflected in this
table. As of December 31, 2015, our pension plans, supplemental retirement plans and other post-retirement
benefit plans were underfunded by $93.3 million.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

**_Estimates_**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make

estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

**_Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable_**

Revenue, net of related discounts and allowances, is recognized when both title and risk of loss of the

product have been transferred to the customer, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable,
collectability is reasonably assured and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Customers take title and
assume all the risks of ownership upon shipment (if terms are “FOB shipping point”) or upon delivery (if terms
are “FOB destination”). Any deviation from the standard terms and arrangements are reviewed for the proper
accounting treatment, and revenue recognition is revised accordingly.

92


-----

We recognize rebates given to customers as a reduction of revenues based on an allocation of the cost of

honoring rebates earned and claimed to each of the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the
customer toward earning the rebate. Rebates are recognized at the time revenue is recorded. We measure the
rebate obligation based on the estimated amount of sales that will result in a rebate at the adjusted sales price per
the respective sales agreement.

Amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction-related to shipping and handling, if any, represent

revenues earned for the goods provided and are classified as revenue. Costs related to shipping and handling of
products shipped to customers are classified as cost of goods sold.

We make certain assumptions and estimates when accruing for allowances for doubtful accounts. Trade

accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful
accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. A
specific reserve for bad debt is recorded for known or suspected doubtful accounts receivable. For all other
accounts, we recognize a reserve for bad debt based on the length of time receivables are past due and historical
write-off experience. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the
receivable will not be recovered. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. We do not have any
off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers.

Our estimates and assumptions made under the revenue recognition policy have been applied on a consistent

basis. The amounts accrued for allowances and returns have not had a material impact on our financial condition
or operating performance.

**_Property, Plant and Equipment, Intangible Assets and Goodwill_**

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost and include expenditures for new facilities and major

renewals and betterments. We capitalize the cost of furnace rebuilds as part of property, plant and equipment.
Plant and equipment under capital leases are carried at the present value of minimum lease payments.
Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred. We capitalize internal costs
associated with the implementation of purchased software. When property, plant and equipment is retired or
otherwise disposed of, the net carrying amount is eliminated with any gain or loss on disposition recognized in
earnings at that time.

Depreciation is generally provided on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets,

ranging up to thirty-three years for buildings, ten to twelve years for machinery and equipment, and three to
seven years for computer hardware and software.

Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill and intangible assets

with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur
or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its
carrying amount. A write-down occurs in periods in which it is determined that a reporting unit’s fair value is
less than its book value.

When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we can either perform a qualitative assessment or a quantitative

assessment on the reporting units. Under a qualitative assessment, we will consider the relevant events and
circumstances and the extent to which they could affect the comparison of a reporting unit’s fair value to its
carrying amount and form a conclusion indicating whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair
value is less than its carrying amount. Under the quantitative assessment, we first compare a reporting unit’s
book value of net assets, including goodwill, to its fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. To the extent that the book value exceeds fair value, we would be required to perform a

93


-----

second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss. See Note 11 in the Notes to Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion on goodwill impairment. We had goodwill cushion (which represents
the percentage difference between each of our five reporting unit’s estimated fair value and its related carrying
value) which varied between 38% and 175% as of our annual impairment test on October 1, 2015.

We perform an impairment review of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets

when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash
flows. When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is
found not to be recoverable, then an impairment loss is recognized. Any impairment loss is measured by
comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. Fair value is determined using quoted market prices
where available, or other techniques including discounted cash flows. Our estimates of future cash flows involve
assumptions concerning future operating performance, economic conditions, and technological changes that may
affect the future useful lives of the assets.

The amortization periods for formulations and product technology range from ten to twelve years. We

amortize customer relationships over periods that range from nine to twenty years. The amortization period for
the non-compete agreements range from five to six and a half years. Amortizable trademarks are amortized over
a ten-year period. The amortization periods for the patents range from eight to fourteen years.

**_Pensions and Postretirement Benefits_**

We maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees in the United States and Canada as

well as certain employees in other international locations. Benefits in the U.S. defined benefit plan and the
service portion of the Canadian defined benefit plan were frozen as of December 31, 2006. Benefits for a
majority of the plans are based on average final pay and years of service. Our funding policy, consistent with
statutory requirements, is based on actuarial computations utilizing the projected unit credit method of
calculation. Not all defined benefit pension plans are funded. In the United States and Canada, the pension plans’
assets include equity, and fixed income securities. Certain assumptions are made regarding the occurrence of
future events affecting pension costs, such as mortality, withdrawal, disablement and retirement, changes in
compensation and benefits, and discount rates to reflect the time value of money.

The major elements in determining our pension income and expense are pension liability discount rates and

the expected return on plan assets. We reference rates of return on high-quality, fixed income investments when
estimating the discount rate, and the expected period over which payments will be made based upon historical
experience. The long-term rate of return used to calculate the expected return on plan assets is the average rate of
return estimated to be earned on invested funds for providing pension benefits.

In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain health care benefits for employees who meet age,

participation and length of service requirements at retirement. These plans were closed to new retirees in the
United States and Canada as of December 31, 2006. We use explicit assumptions using the best estimates
available of the plan’s future experience. Principal actuarial assumptions include discount rates, present value
factors, retirement age, participation rates, mortality rates, cost trend rates, Medicare reimbursement rates and per
capita claims cost by age. Current interest rates, as of the measurement date, are used for discount rates in present
value calculations.

**_Income Taxes_**

We operate within multiple tax jurisdictions and are subject to tax filing requirements and audit within these

jurisdictions. We use the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported
amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the

94


-----

results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce
the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized.

In determining the provision for income taxes, we provide deferred income taxes on income from foreign

subsidiaries whose earnings are deemed by us not to be permanently reinvested as such earnings are taxable upon
remittance to the United States. We establish contingent liabilities for possible assessments by taxing authorities
resulting from uncertain tax positions including, but not limited to, transfer pricing, deductibility of certain
expenses and other state, local, and foreign tax matters. We recognize a financial statement benefit for positions
taken for tax return purposes when it will be more-likely-than-not that the positions will be sustained. We
recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax
examinations are often complex as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by us and
may require several years to resolve. These accrued liabilities represent a provision for taxes that are reasonably
expected to be incurred on the basis of available information but which are not certain.

**_Contingent Liabilities_**

Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to

us but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management and
legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or unasserted claims that
may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or
unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability is accrued in our financial statements. If the assessment
indicates that a loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be
estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if
determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed
unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed, including the
approximate term, how the guarantee arose, and the events or circumstances that would require the guarantor to
perform under the guarantee.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

Our major market risk exposure is potential losses arising from changing rates and prices regarding foreign

currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk and credit risk. The audit committee of our
board of directors regularly reviews foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity hedging activity and monitors
compliance with our hedging policy. We do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes and we limit
our hedging activity to the underlying economic exposure.

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

Our financial results are subject to the impact of gains and losses on currency translations, which occur

when the financial statements of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. We operate a geographically
diverse business with approximately 53% of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2015, coming from
our international operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because consolidated financial results are
reported in U.S. dollars, sales or earnings generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar can result in a
significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales and earnings when translated to U.S. dollars. The
financial statements of our operations outside the United States, where the local currency is considered to be the
functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date
for assets and liabilities and the average exchange rate for each period for sales, expenses, gains, losses and cash
flows. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated
significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The foreign currencies to which we have the most

95


-----

significant exchange rate exposure include the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the
Mexican peso. Sales in these top five currencies represent approximately 42% of our total sales during the year
ended December 31, 2015. A 10% change in these currencies would impact sales by approximately $43.1
million, or 4% of consolidated sales assuming product pricing remain constant. The effect of translating foreign
subsidiaries’ balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income. The impact of gains and
losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant operations are
included in other non-operating expense. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates
during the year. Net foreign exchange included in other expense was a $21.1million loss, and a $23.4 million
loss, for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The foreign currency loss realized in the
years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were primarily driven by the non-permanent intercompany debt
denominated in local currency translated to U.S. dollars and were principally non-cash in nature.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and New Senior

Unsecured Notes. Changes in interest rates will not affect the market value of such debt but will affect the
amount of our interest payments over the term of the loans. Likewise, an increase in interest rates could have a
material impact on our cash flow. As of December 31, 2015 on a pro forma basis for the Business Combination
and related financing transactions, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on our New Term Loan Facility and
New Senior Unsecured Notes would have an estimated impact on pre-tax earnings of approximately $18.3
million absent any interest rate cap.

We hedge the interest rate fluctuations on debt obligations through interest rate cap agreements. We record

the fair value of these hedges as assets or liabilities and the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred in
stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The interest rate caps had
a fair value asset of $0.0 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Fair value is
determined based on estimated amounts that would be received or paid to terminate the contracts at the reporting
date based on quoted market prices.

**_Commodity Risk_**

We purchase significant amounts of natural gas to supply the energy required in our production processes

for our products in each of our businesses. Since we are a producer of inorganic chemicals, natural gas provides
an energy source for us but is not a direct feedstock of our products. Therefore, exposure to the volatility in
energy prices is less than that of producers of organic petrochemicals. We purchase approximately 12 million
mmbtu’s of natural gas in a given year. Thus, a $1 increase in the cost of natural gas would impact our cost of
goods sold by approximately $12 million absent hedging. Our purchase agreements with our customers typically
provide for the pass through of natural gas price increases; however, there is no guarantee that we will continue
to be able to pass through future price increases without loss of existing customers. We have implemented a
hedging program in the United States which allows us to mitigate exposure to natural gas volatility with natural
gas swap agreements. We also make forward purchases of natural gas in regard to our production at certain other
subsidiary locations.

The natural gas swap agreements had a fair value net liability of $3.9 million at December 31, 2015 and a

fair value net liability of $4.2 million at December 31, 2014. Fair value is determined based on estimated
amounts that would be received or paid to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on quoted market
prices of comparable contracts. The respective current and non-current liabilities are recorded in accrued
liabilities and other long-term liabilities. The related unrealized gains or losses are recorded in stockholders’
equity as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Realized gains and losses on natural gas
hedges are included in production cost and subsequently charged to cost of goods sold in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations in the period in which inventory is sold.

96


-----

**_Credit Risk_**

We are exposed to credit risk on financial instruments to the extent our counterparty fails to perform certain

duties as required under the provisions of an agreement. We only transact with counterparties having an
appropriate credit rating for the risk involved. Credit exposure is managed through credit approval and
monitoring procedures.

Concentration of credit risk can result primarily from trade receivables, for example, with certain customers

operating in the same industry or customer groups located in the same geographic region. Credit risk related to
these types of receivables is managed through credit approval and monitoring procedures. In the year ended
December 31, 2015, we wrote off $0.2 million, or .02%, in bad debt on total sales of $1,024.3 million.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND**

**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF ECO**

_The following discussion and analysis of Eco’s, and its predecessor, Eco Services, a business unit of Solvay,_

_financial condition and results of operations covers periods prior to the consummation of the Business_
_Combination and the 2014 Acquisition. Accordingly, the discussion and analysis of historical periods does not_
_reflect the significant impact the 2014 Acquisition, had on Eco, or the significant impact that the Business_
_Combination will have on Eco, in each case including without limitation, increased leverage, the impact of_
_acquisition accounting and debt service requirements as described below. Prior to the 2014 Acquisition, Eco_
_Services did not historically operate as a stand-alone business, but instead as a business unit of Solvay. As a_
_result, the predecessor financial information may not reflect what its results of operations, financial condition_
_and cash flows would have been had Eco operated as a separate, stand-alone company for all of the periods_
_presented. You should read the following discussion of Eco’s financial condition and results of operations in_
_conjunction with “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements,” “Selected Consolidated_
_Financial Data of Eco,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of PQ Holdings,” “Management’s Discussion_
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of PQ Holdings” and the historical consolidated_
_financial statements of PQ Holdings’ and Eco and its predecessor, Eco Services, a business unit of Solvay, and_
_the notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. This discussion contains forward-looking_
_statements and actual results may differ materially from those suggested by its forward-looking statements for_
_various reasons, including those discussed in “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Disclosure Regarding Forward-_
_Looking Statements” sections of this offering memorandum._

**General**

Eco is the leading producer of sulfuric acid for the merchant sales in the United States. Sulfuric acid is the

largest chemical product produced in the United States by volume, with an operating history dating to the 1880s.
Eco holds the number one U.S. supply share position in both sulfuric acid regeneration and the production of
virgin sulfuric acid for merchant sales. Sulfuric acid regeneration is the process of recycling spent sulfuric acid
into fresh sulfuric acid for continuous supply to the oil refining industry, which uses sulfuric acid in the
production of alkylates for gasoline blending. Virgin sulfuric acid is created by manufacturing sulfuric acid
products from sulfur and other raw materials. It is used for supply to a wide range of industrial end-users in the
U.S. including the nylon, mining, general industrial and chemicals industries.

**Organization and Transactions**

**_Reorganization_**

On August 18, 2015, PQ and Eco announced the Business Combination under a newly formed holding

company, the Combined Company. The Combined Company will retain the PQ Corporation name.

PQ’s existing indirect shareholders (affiliates of CCMP), affiliates of INEOS and PQ’s management) and

our existing indirect equity holders (affiliates of CCMP and management) will constitute the shareholders of the
Combined Company immediately following the closing of the Business Combination. The Business Combination
will not constitute a change in control under the Eco Term Facility and the 2022 Notes (as further described
below), as CCMP will control the majority of the outstanding equity of the Combined Company after the
Business Combination. See “Summary—The Business Combination.”

**_The 2014 Acquisition_**

On July 30, 2014, Eco entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Solvay (the “Asset Purchase

Agreement”), which provided for the sale, transfer and assignment by Solvay, and the acquisition, acceptance
and assumption by Eco, of substantially all of the assets of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit for Solvay’s

98


-----

sulfuric acid virgin production and regeneration business operations in the United States (the “2014
Acquisition”), which constitutes the business of Eco following the 2014 Acquisition.

The 2014 Acquisition closed on December 1, 2014 (the “Closing Date”). The purchase price for the Eco

Services business was $890.0 million in cash, subject to adjustment for certain items, including the actual level of
working capital at the closing of the 2014 Acquisition, and a defined contribution plan adjustment. The working
capital and defined contribution plan adjustments to the purchase price resulted in a reduction to the purchase
price of $8.5 million to $881.5 million, which Eco has settled with Solvay.

The 2014 Acquisition and related transactions were funded with the proceeds of the following transactions:

**_Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities_**

Concurrently with the consummation of the 2014 Acquisition, Eco entered into a $500.0 million seven-year

term loan facility, all of which was drawn on the Closing Date, and a $55.0 million five-year revolving credit
facility (the “Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). The full amount of the $500.0 million term loan
facility net of a $2.5 million discount was drawn on the Closing Date to finance a portion of the 2014
Acquisition, including the payment of related fees, expenses and other costs of the transactions.

As of December 31, 2015, there was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility. A portion of the

revolving credit facility not to exceed $25.0 million is also available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of
December 31, 2015, Eco issued letters of credit totaling $13.3 million.

All outstanding revolving loans under the Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities are due and payable

in full upon the expiration of its seven-year term. In the case of the term loans, Eco is required to make scheduled
quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the $500.0 million term loans, with the
balance due on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date. $5.0 million of principal payments have been made
to date by Eco as of December 31, 2015. The Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be repaid and
terminated in connection with the Business Combination.

**_2022 Notes_**

Eco issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2022 Notes under an indenture dated

October 24, 2014 (the “2022 Notes Indenture”). Interest on the 2022 Notes is payable in cash semi-annually in
arrears on each May 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2015. The 2022 Notes will mature on
November 1, 2022. The 2022 Notes will remain outstanding following the consummation of the Business
Combination. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

**_Equity Investment_**

In connection with the 2014 Acquisition, affiliates of CCMP contributed $230.0 million in cash and

members of its board of managers and management contributed $9.9 million in cash. These funds were invested
directly or indirectly in Eco Services Group Holdings LLC (“Group Holdings”). Group Holdings contributed the
proceeds to its wholly owned subsidiary, Eco Services Intermediate Holdings LLC (“Intermediate Holdings”).
Intermediate Holdings in turn contributed the proceeds to its wholly owned subsidiary, Eco.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, certain investors, members of its board of managers and

management contributed an additional $3.1 million to Group Holdings, which was contributed to Intermediate
Holdings. Intermediate Holdings then contributed these proceeds to Eco.

99


-----

**_Transition Services Agreement_**

Concurrently with the consummation of the 2014 Acquisition, Eco entered into a transition services

agreement with Solvay (the “Transition Services Agreement”), which provides certain transition services to Eco
by Solvay and from Eco to Solvay. The services include the provision of information technology services, certain
workspace related services, cost accounting services and consulting services, among others. The Transition
Services Agreement provides for a term of three months to one year from the Closing Date for the provision of
services thereunder, depending upon the service to be provided. Eco incurred $4.9 million of fees for the
transaction services provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement for the year ended December 31,
2015. The Transition Services Agreement was terminated as of December 31, 2015.

**_Cross-Services Agreement_**

In connection with the 2014 Acquisition, Eco entered into a Cross-Services Agreement (the “CSA”) with

Aroma Performance, a Solvay business unit (“Aroma”), on July 28, 2014. The CSA pertains to Eco’s Baton
Rouge, LA site. In connection with the CSA, Eco has agreed to continue to provide certain services that Eco has
historically provided to Aroma when Eco operated as a component of Solvay, including its well water and
process steam requirements. The CSA provides for an initial term of five years. Further, Eco has also agreed to
provide Aroma with the use of space, operating machinery, and handling of chemicals on the site. Aroma has
agreed to provide Eco with nitrogen for a period of twelve months at a price equal to pass-through supplier costs
as well as electricity and certain emergency response services.

**_Silica Sales Agreement_**

In connection with the 2014 Acquisition, Eco entered into an agreement (the “Silica Sales Agreement”) with

Solvay’s Silica business unit (“Silica”) pursuant to which Eco has agreed to provide Silica with sulfuric acid
produced at Eco’s Hammond, IN plant for a term of five years, renewing automatically for one year terms
thereafter. Eco historically provided sulfuric acid to Silica when Eco operated as a component of Solvay.

**Effects of the 2014 Acquisition on Eco’s Financial Statements**

**_Acquisition Accounting_**

Eco’s consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the 2014 Acquisition vary in important

respects from the financial statements prior to that date. Eco accounted for the 2014 Acquisition using the
acquisition method of accounting. As a result, the purchase price of $881.5 million was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over
these allocations was assigned to goodwill, which is subject to testing for impairment at least annually. The
allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired in the 2014 Acquisition resulted in an increase in
amortization relating to Eco’s acquired definite lived intangible assets because Eco recorded the fair value of the
acquired intangible assets. Eco amortizes the acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives ranging
from five to fifteen years.

**_Increased Leverage_**

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Eco had $695.0 million and $700.0 million, respectively, of gross

outstanding total indebtedness from the Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 2022 Notes ($673.1
million and $675.3 million, respectively, net of debt discount and debt issuance costs), respectively. As a result
of the 2014 Acquisition, Eco has a substantial amount of leverage and its financing expense increased
significantly following the consummation of the 2014 Acquisition.

100


-----

**_Stand-alone Company_**

Prior to the 2014 Acquisition, Eco operated as a component of Solvay and not as a stand-alone company.

The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 reflect the financial position and results
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to
December 31, 2014 of Eco and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eco Finance Corp. on a stand-alone basis (the
“Successor Financial Statements”). The Company had no operations prior to the 2014 Acquisition. The post2014 Acquisition consolidated financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting incorporating fair value
adjustments made in applying the acquisition method of accounting.

Prior to December 1, 2014, the financial statements of Eco included herein reflect amounts that have been

“carved out” from the accounting records of Solvay using assumptions and allocations made by Solvay to depict
Eco’s operations on a carve-out basis (the “Predecessor Financial Statements”). The Predecessor Financial
Statements may not reflect what Eco’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been
had Eco operated as a separate, stand-alone company without the shared resources of Solvay for the periods
presented and may not be indicative of Eco’s future results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
Additionally, Eco historically provided services to other business components of Solvay. In connection with the
2014 Acquisition, Eco entered into agreements to continue to provide these services on third-party terms as
described above. Eco believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the Predecessor Financial
Statements are reasonable.

For comparison to prior periods, Eco has included the Successor’s results of operations for the period from

inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014, and the Predecessor’s results of operations for the period from
January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014. However, the combined results for these two periods may not reflect
what Eco’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had Eco operated as a
separate, stand- alone company for the combination of these periods.

**Factors and Trends Affecting Results**

**_Demand_**

Sulfuric acid is a core input for a diverse range of industries including the production of fertilizers,

petroleum products, detergents, dyes, insecticides, drugs, plastics, steel, storage batteries, nylon and many other
materials. Eco’s principal customers include those in the oil refining, mining, nylon production, general industrial
and chemical, and agricultural industries. While economic trends may impact any particular source of end-use
demand, the broad utility of sulfuric acid tends to significantly insulate sulfuric acid manufacturers from
volatility in volumes and Eco believes the overall outlook for sulfuric acid volumes over the next five years is
positive.

**_Sulfuric Acid Regeneration_**

In regeneration, Eco’s volumes are supported by a stable base of large refinery customers. Overall, a variety

of countervailing trends are expected to influence volume demand in the medium term (approximately one to
seven years) including projected increases to gasoline exporting and higher alkylate production due to an
increase in alkylate feedstock supply arising from increased domestic production of shale gas and shale oil. In
some periods, Eco expects lower volume requirements from specific customers due to periodic major plant
turnarounds.

**_Gasoline Demand_**

Total domestic gasoline production has grown 5.2% in the U.S. from 2010 to 2015, driven primarily by

rising gasoline exports as well as rising vehicle miles traveled domestically. Eco expects growing petroleum

101


-----

exports to continue to offset softening domestic demand growth. However, in 2015, lower crude oil prices and
the resulting lower gasoline prices have contributed to a 3.3% year over year increase in domestic gasoline
consumption.

The United States Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”) projects net exports of petroleum

products to grow at a 2.3% CAGR from 2013 to 2040. The export market for U.S. refineries has become more
favorable due to competitively priced oil supplies and the related idling of uncompetitive European based
refining capacity. The largest exporters tend to be Gulf Coast refineries, accessing markets such as Brazil and
Argentina for gasoline, and Europe for distillate. Due to Eco’s leading Gulf Coast supply share position, Eco
expects to benefit from gasoline production in the Gulf Coast directed at export markets.

**_Alkylate Demand_**

While increased fuel efficiency in vehicles tends to decrease gasoline demand, it also tends to increase the

relative contribution of alkylates in gasoline refining, increasing sulfuric acid demand. Increasing regulatory
standards, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards which regulate mile per gallon
performance in light vehicle manufacturing, have resulted in a proliferation of turbo-charged and other engine
types that require higher octane fuel ratings. Increasing the octane rating of gasoline requires the use of blending
agents, among which alkylate is preferred due to its effectiveness and lower emissions.

While increased fuel efficiency in vehicles tends to decrease gasoline demand, it also tends to increase the

relative contribution of alkylates in gasoline refining, increasing sulfuric acid demand. Increasing regulatory
standards, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards which regulate mile per gallon performance in
light vehicle manufacturing, have resulted in a proliferation of turbo-charged and other engine types that require
higher-octane fuel ratings. Increasing the octane rating of gasoline requires the use of blending agents, among
which alkylate is preferred due to effectiveness and lower emissions. In March 2016, the EIA reported that
premium gasoline sales as a percentage of overall gasoline sales in 2015 had risen 11.3% up from 7.8% in 2008.
The EIA concluded that the increase was likely due to the higher-octane requirements of new light duty vehicles.

The EPA’s Tier 3 Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards Program prescribes new proposed sulfur regulations

which will take effect in 2017. The regulations will stipulate lower allowable sulfur content in gasoline, from the
current standard of 30 parts per million (“ppm”) to a proposed limit of 10 ppm throughout the United States, with
the exception of California which already has a 10 ppm sulfur limit. These regulations will require refineries to
remove more sulfur from hydrocracked gasoline, which causes a lowering of the octane rating of that gasoline.
To raise the octane rating, alkylate is expected to be an attractive blending component since its typical sulfur
content is around 5 ppm. Butane, another widely used octane enhancer, typically has higher sulfur content and
much higher vapor pressure than alkylate. Higher demand for alkylate production is expected to result in
increased demand for sulfuric acid by oil refineries.

The growth in shale-oil derived crude production in the United States is projected to continue to benefit the

refining industry. According to OPEC, tight oil production in the United States will increase 26% from 2014
levels to four million barrels per day by 2020. The lighter crude oil produced from shale generates lower octane
gasoline, which can demand more alkylate in order to boost octane to required levels.

Another trend being observed currently is the proliferation of gasses such as isobutane and propylene, which

are used as feed stocks in a refinery’s alkylation process. The accumulation is due to the increased production of
shale gas and shale oil, which has increased the production of by-product isobutane and propane (used to produce
propylene). According to EIA data, U.S. Gas Plant production of isobutane has grown by 58% between 2010 and
2015. The rise in volume of alkylate feed stocks released through the extraction and refining of shale gas and
crudes has resulted in more of those feedstocks, such as isobutane to be used in the production process. The
conversion process used to turn isobutane and propylene into alkylates requires a high volume of sulfuric acid
and thus the proliferation of isobutane and propylene is driving demand for sulfuric acid.

**_Virgin Sulfuric Acid Demand_**

In virgin sulfuric acid, general industrial users in the United States are expected to be influenced by positive

economic trends and continue to benefit from competitively priced natural gas used in their manufacturing
activities. Additionally, Eco believes its mining customers have long reserve lives and are increasing production
to meet global consumption demand for copper and borates. Both of these trends are expected to lead to higher
virgin sulfuric acid demand.

Excluding the refining industry, which is served primarily by acid regeneration, the four virgin sulfuric acid

demand regions are (i) the Southwest, primarily from the mining industry users; (ii) the Gulf Coast, led by the
nylon and general chemical and industrial users; (iii) the Midwest, driven by agricultural and general chemical
users; and (iv) the East, primarily from general chemical and industrial users including pulp and paper and water
treatment. In 2015, in Eco’s virgin sulfuric acid product line, Eco primarily served the Nylon (30% of 2015 net
sales), General Industrial and Chemical (29% of 2015 net sales) and Mining (25% of 2015 net sales) end-uses.

_Nylon._ Sulfuric acid is used in the production of caprolactam, the key constituent of nylon. Globally,

demand for caprolactam, a compound used almost exclusively for the manufacture of nylon, is expected to grow
by 3.2% annually between 2013 and 2018, with Asia accounting for 70% of global demand for caprolactam by
2018. The U.S. nylon industry currently benefits from access to low-cost natural gas feedstock, positioning
domestic producers strongly to capitalize on forecasted growth relative to higher-cost European exporters. As of
2013, the United States produced approximately 17% of the global caprolactam supply.

_General Industrial and Chemical._ Eco’s general industrial and chemical customers comprise a broad range

of sulfuric acid users, including lead-acid battery manufacturers and customers that consume acid in an industrial
chemical or manufacturing process, or use sulfuric acid to treat waste streams resulting from the process. Low
cost feedstock in the United States has fueled more than an estimated $100 billion of expenditures related to
project announcements for 148 new plants and/or expansions of existing plants in the chemical sector primarily
in the Gulf Coast, which Eco believes will increase demand for virgin sulfuric acid over time.

_Copper Mining._ Copper consumers use sulfuric acid in their copper leaching processes, sourcing acid from

both their own production facilities and from the merchant producers. Total global copper consumption is
expected to increase by 27% between 2014 and 2024.

_Borax Mining._ Eco’s borate customer produces approximately 30% of the world’s borates, which are used

to produce boric acid used in specialty glass applications, such as LED, LCD and smart devices, fiberglass, solar
cells, and crop yield and pesticide products. Global demand for boric acid is expected to grow by approximately
5% annually through to 2020, driven primarily by end-use demand in agriculture, ceramics, detergents and
insulation production.

**_Pass-Through Contracts and Raw Material Inputs_**

Most of Eco’s contracts feature take-or-pay volume protection and/or quarterly price adjustments for

commodity inputs, labor, the Chemical Engineering Index (U.S. chemical plant construction cost index) and
natural gas. In Eco’s regeneration product line, over 99% of Eco’s 2015 and 2014 volumes were under contracts
featuring quarterly price adjustments. In Eco’s virgin acid product line, approximately 81% and 89% of 2015 and
2014 volumes were under contracts featuring quarterly price adjustments, respectively. The price adjustments
generally reflect Eco’s actual cost structure in producing acid, and tend to protect us from volatility in labor,
fixed costs and raw material pricing. Freight expenses are generally passed through directly to customers. Spent
acid for the regeneration business is supplied by customers for a nominal charge as part of their contracts.

**_Refinery and Competitor Plant Outages_**

The volumes of regenerated sulfuric acid Eco produces as well as its results of operations are impacted by

outages or planned turnarounds at captive sulfuric plants operated by oil refineries or by outages at the plants

operated by Eco’s competitors. In the past Eco has experienced increased volumes as a result of turnarounds or
outages at captive plants. Additionally, in the past Eco has experienced increased volumes and net sales as a
result of outages at competitor plants.

**Description of Key Financial Statement Line Items**

_Net Sales._ Net sales represent revenue from the sale of virgin sulfuric acid, regenerated acid and treatment

and other products and services. Revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete. This generally
occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of the agreement, title and risk of
loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.

_Cost of Sales._ Cost of sales includes fixed and variable costs to manufacture procure and ship products and

provide services sold and recognized as sales revenue. Variable costs are those costs that vary depending on
Eco’s production volume. Excluding freight, variable costs in Eco’s regeneration product line primarily consist
of natural gas, caustic, electricity and water. Excluding freight, variable costs in Eco’s virgin product line
primarily consist of sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, caustic soda and electricity. Fixed costs include plant fixed costs
such as labor, maintenance, insurance, property taxes as well as fixed freight costs.

_Contribution Margin._ Contribution margin represents sales less variable costs and is a non-GAAP

measure. This is a measure of profitability that management reviews to evaluate the results for regenerated acid
and virgin acid before fixed costs which cannot be easily allocated between the two products.

**Adjustments from Historical Financial Statements**

The results of operations presented in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations reflect certain adjustments from the historical financial statements included
immediately above. Listed below are the material adjustments made by management and the basis for each
adjustment:

   - Expenses characterized as cost of sales in the historical financial statements have been split into two line

items, variable costs and fixed costs. Additionally, plant-related depreciation and amortization, which is
included in cost of sales in the historical financial statements, has been removed from fixed costs and has
been included in depreciation and amortization to provide a more transparent breakdown of actual cash
fixed costs. Additionally, the fixed costs are not allocated among the three product lines and separating
variable costs allows us to track contribution margin on a product line basis. The following table
reconciles variable costs, depreciation and amortization, and fixed costs (excluding depreciation and
amortization) to cost of sales.

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales decreased to $388.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to combined net sales

of $397.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a decrease of $8.5 million or 2.1%.
Product line sales decreased to $382.9 million compared to $390.7 million for the same period last year,
representing a decrease of $7.8 million, or 2.0%. Sales from abatement and other services also decreased slightly
by $0.7 million.

Regeneration sales increased to $192.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $191.2

million in the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $1.7 million, primarily due to higher
sales volumes.

Virgin acid sales decreased to $167.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $178.5

million in the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a decrease of $10.9 million, or 6.1%, due to lower
raw material (sulfur) costs passed through to customers, reflected in lower pricing, and reduced supply
commitment to a large customer.

Other products and services sales increased to $22.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared

to $21.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $1.4 million, or 6.7%, due to
increased treatment services sales volumes.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $282.8 million for the year ended

December 31, 2015 compared to $302.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a decrease
of $19.5 million, or 6.5%. The decrease was driven by $9.9 million lower variable costs, $7.9 million lower fixed

107


-----

costs and $1.8 million lower depreciation and amortization costs. Variable costs were lower for the year ended
December 31, 2015 due to lower sulfur prices, and lower natural gas prices. The decrease in fixed costs was
primarily due to lower plant fixed costs and lower freight transportation costs, offset by additional insurance
costs as a stand-alone company in contrast to when Eco was a business unit of Solvay.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit increased to $106.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $95.0 million in

the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $11.1 million, or 11.7%. The increase was
primarily due to lower variable and fixed costs offset by slightly lower sales volume, as described above.

**_Contribution Margin_**

Contribution margin increased to $255.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $254.5

million in the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $1.4 million, or 0.5%, mainly due to a
sales volume reduction in virgin acid, offset by increased regeneration and treatment services sales.

Regeneration contribution margin increased to $145.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015

compared to $134.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $11.2 million, or
8.3%, driven by increased sales volumes.

Virgin acid contribution margin decreased to $89.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared

to $94.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a decrease of $5.0 million, or 5.3%, driven
by volume reductions, including a decrease in Eco’s supply commitment to a large customer.

Contribution margin from other products and services increased to $21.3 million in the year ended

December 31, 2015 compared to $20.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of
$0.8 million, or 4.2%, driven by higher treatment services sales volumes.

**_Selling, General, and Administrative Expense_**

Selling, general, and administrative expense decreased to $47.9 million in the year ended December 31,

2015 compared to $63.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a decrease of $15.7 million,
or 24.6%. The decrease was primarily due to corporate allocations and higher depreciation expense in 2014.
Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in certain selling, general and administrative expenses, due to
post-acquisition transition costs associated with the 2014 Acquisition, including the costs of the Transition
Services Agreement, stock-based compensation expense, higher salaries, fringe benefits and severance expense,
plus increased professional fees for accounting, legal and other advisory services.

**_Fixed Costs and Interest Expense_**

Fixed costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) and interest expense were 21.2% higher for the year

ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to higher interest
expenses. The following provides additional detail on the underlying changes in fixed costs and interest expense:

Fixed costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) were $115.5 million for year ended December 31,

2015 compared to $123.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a $7.8 million, or 6.4% decrease. The
decrease in fixed costs was driven primarily by lower plant fixed costs and lower fixed freight costs, offset by
additional insurance costs of a stand-alone company.

Interest expense was $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.6 million of

interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to a full year of interest expense in 2015 for the
$700.0 million of new debt obligations related to the Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 2022
Notes issued on December 1, 2014 by Eco.

**Combined Successor and Predecessor Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Predecessor Year**
**Ended December 31, 2013**

**_Net Sales_**

Combined net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $397.4 million compared to $390.8 million

for the year ended December 31 2013, representing an increase of $6.6 million, or 1.7%. Regeneration sales
increased by $14.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, which was partially offset by a $4.9
million decline in virgin sales. Sales from other products and services for the year ended December 31, 2014
increased $2.1 million, or 11.1% compared to the same period in 2013.

Regeneration sales increased to $191.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $176.9

million in the year ended December 31, 2013, representing an increase of $14.3 million, or 8.1%, due to stronger
volumes from West Coast and Gulf Coast refineries and increased prices at certain refineries for certain
customers.

Virgin acid sales decreased to $178.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $183.4

million in the year ended December 31, 2013, representing a decrease of $4.9 million, or 2.7%, due to lower raw
material (sulfur) costs passed through to contract customers, reflected in lower pricing.

Other products and services sales increased to $21.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared

to $18.9 million in year ended December 31, 2013, representing an increase of $2.1 million, or 11.1%, due to
stronger treatment service sales.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $16.0 million, or 5.6%, to $302.4 million

from $286.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was driven by $2.9 million higher
variable costs, $10.5 million higher fixed costs and $2.6 million higher depreciation and amortization. Variable
costs were higher in the year ended December 31, 2014 due to $3.5 million amortization of inventory step-up
associated with acquisition accounting relating to inventory, offset by lower sulfur prices, while the increase in
fixed costs was driven by certain salary increases, higher rail car maintenance, and higher barge towing and barge
leasing cost. The changes in depreciation and amortization are due to step-up associated with acquisition
accounting and increased capital expenditures.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $9.5 million, or 9.1%, to $95.0 million

compared to $104.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by higher fixed costs
as discussed in the section below on fixed costs and other expenses.

**_Contribution Margin_**

Contribution margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.6 million, or 1.4%, to $254.5

million compared to $250.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to price increases in regeneration,
volume growth in virgin acid and favorable mix in both product lines.

Regeneration contribution margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $134.3 million from

$128.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, driven by price increases at certain refineries for certain
customers and favorable customer mix from increased volumes from certain customers with above average
pricing, partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease from amortization of inventory step-up associated with
acquisition accounting.

109


-----

Virgin acid contribution margin decreased to $94.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 from

$101.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 driven by production issues at a plant which resulted in
increased production and freight costs, and a $1.8 million decrease from the one-time amortization of inventory
step-up associated with acquisition accounting.

Contribution margin from other products and services increased to $20.5 million in the year ended

December 31, 2014 from $19.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 driven by higher sales.

**_Selling, General, and Administrative Expense_**

SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased 39.2% to $63.6 million from $45.7 million

in the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by $14.7 million in transaction-related
costs from the 2014 Acquisition. The changes in corporate allocations and depreciation and amortization are
further discussed under fixed costs and other expenses below.

**_Fixed Costs and Other Expenses_**

Fixed costs and other expenses were 9.3% higher for year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year

ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to higher fixed costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), SG&A
expenses (excluding corporate allocations and depreciation and amortization), and depreciation and amortization
partially offset by lower corporate allocations. The following provides additional detail on the underlying
changes in fixed costs and other expenses:

   - Fixed costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) were $123.3 million for the year ended

December 31, 2014 compared to $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a $10.5 million, or
9.3% increase. The increase in fixed costs was driven by certain salary increases, higher rail car
maintenance, and higher barge towing and barge leasing cost.

   - SG&A expenses (excluding corporate allocations and depreciation and amortization) were $41.4 million

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013,
a $22.5 million, or 119.0%, increase. The increase was primarily due to $14.7 million in transaction costs
related to the 2014 Acquisition, and secondarily from higher salaries and higher fringe benefits.

   - The benefit (provision) for environmental reserve was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014

compared to $(1.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a $1.4 million, or 116.6%, decrease
due primarily to an agreement with the California DEQ to revise a remediation plan at the Dominguez site
which released $0.6 million from reserves.

   - Depreciation and amortization was $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to

$43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a $1.9 million, or 4.4% increase, due to step-up
associated with acquisition accounting and increases in capital expenditures.

   - Interest expense, net was $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to interest expense

of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the $700.0 million of new debt obligations
related to the Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 2022 Notes.

**_Provision for Income Taxes_**

Following the 2014 Acquisition, Eco is now a single member limited liability company (LLC), treated as an

entity disregarded as separate from its owner for federal and state income tax purposes. All income tax liabilities
and/or benefits of Eco are passed through to the member. As such, no recognition of federal or state income taxes
for Eco has been provided for in the Successor Financial Statements.

For the Predecessor Financial Statements, income taxes have been prepared on a separate return basis as if

Eco Services was a stand-alone entity. Historically, Eco Services was included in the tax filings with other
Solvay entities. Eco Services’ tax results as presented are not reflective of the results that Eco Services will
generate following the 2014 Acquisition or would have generated on a stand-alone basis.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Historical Cash Flows_**

The statements of cash flows reflect the changes in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended

December 31, 2015, the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014, the period from January 1,
2014 to November 30, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2013, by classifying transactions into three major
categories: operating, investing, and financing activities.

**_Historical Operating Activities_**

**_Successor_**

Net cash provided by operating activities was $48.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net

cash provided by operating activities was the result of net income of $13.8 million adjusted for noncash items of
$47.5 million for depreciation, amortization, amortization of debt issuance costs, accretion of debt discount,
pension expense, loss on disposal of fixed assets, and stock-based compensation expense. Routine operating
activities produced cash of $24.1 million through net changes in other receivables and prepaid expenses. These
activities were offset by certain routine operating activities which used cash of $36.5 million represented by net
changes in accounts receivable, inventories, other noncurrent assets, accounts payable, other payables, accrued
expenses and other current liabilities, pension funding, accrued interest payable and other long-term liabilities.

Net cash used in operating activities was $2.0 million for the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to

December 31, 2014. The net cash used by operating activities was the result of a net loss of $22.1 million
adjusted for noncash items of $3.2 million for depreciation, amortization, including amortization of debt issuance
costs and accretion of debt discount. Cash provided of $16.9 million was generated from routine operating
activities represented by net changes in accounts receivable, other receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses,
accounts payable, other payables, other current liabilities, accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities. For
the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014, routine operating activities produced cash
through a decrease in inventory of $4.9 million, an increase in other payables, other current liabilities, accrued
interest payable, and other long-term liabilities of $23.7 million. This was partially offset by an increase in
accounts receivable and other receivables of $7.9 million, increase in prepaid insurance and other current assets
of $2.2 million, and decrease in accounts payable of $1.6 million.

**_Predecessor_**

Net cash provided by operating activities was $57.8 million for the period from January 1, 2014 to

November 30, 2014. The net cash provided by operating activities was the result of net income of $30.5 million
adjusted for noncash items of $32.7 million for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and
deferred income tax expense. Cash used of $5.5 million for routine operating activities represented by changes in
accounts receivable, other receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, other
long-term liabilities, and long-term deferred revenue. For the period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014,
routine operating activities used cash through an increase in accounts receivable and other receivables of $4.1
million, an increase in inventories of $5.2 million, a decrease in other long-term liabilities of $2.1 million, and
decrease in deferred revenue of $3.6 million. This was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $6.8
million, and an increase in other current liabilities of $2.6 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $84.4 million was the

result of net income of $39.3 million adjusted for noncash items of $43.0 million for depreciation, amortization,
stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax expense. Cash provided by operations was adjusted by of
$2.2 million for routine operating activities represented by changes in accounts receivable, other receivables,
inventories, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, other long-term liabilities, and long-term
deferred revenue. In 2013, routine operating activities produced cash through a decrease in accounts receivable

111


-----

and other receivables of $10.7 million and a decrease in inventories of $3.5 million. This was partially offset by a
decrease in accounts payable of $6.1 million, a decrease in accrued expenses of $2.5 million, and a decrease in
other long-term liabilities including long-term deferred revenue of $3.3 million.

**_Historical Investing Activities_**

**_Successor_**

Net cash used for investing activities was $42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to

purchases of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets as well as noncurrent deposits.

Net cash used for investing activities for the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014

was $888.3 million, primarily as the result of cash paid for the acquisition of Eco Services of $885.4 million, and
$2.9 million for purchases of property, plant, and equipment.

**_Predecessor_**

Net cash used for investing activities for the period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014 was $32.9

million in connection with purchases of property, plant, and equipment. Net cash used for investing activities was
$41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 in connection with purchases of property, plant, and
equipment.

**_Historical Financing Activities_**

**_Successor_**

Net cash used in financing activities was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due

to $5.0 million repayment of term loan borrowings as well as $0.2 million of payments on capital leases, partially
offset by proceeds from issuance of member’s equity of $1.5 million. The Company borrowed and repaid $12
million from its revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31,

2014 was $913.0 million. Eco provided cash from financing activities as the result of proceeds for the funding of
the 2014 Acquisition, including $239.9 million from the issuance of members’ equity, $497.5 million proceeds
from issuance of the Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities borrowings, net of discount, and $200.0
million proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Unsecured Notes, partially offset by debt issuance costs of
$24.4 million.

**_Predecessor_**

Net cash used for financing activities was $24.9 million for the Predecessor period. Eco used cash to pay

$0.2 million for capital lease obligations and $24.7 million in net transfers to Solvay.

Net cash used for financing activities was $42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Eco

Services used cash to pay $1.5 million for capital lease obligations and $41.3 million in net cash transfers to
Solvay.

**_Historical Liquidity_**

Eco’s primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations and availability of the revolving credit

facility under the Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Eco’s primary uses of cash are for debt service
and capital expenditures.

112


-----

Eco’s working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) position of $16.0 million as of December 31,

2015 represents an increase of $9.5 million from the December 31, 2014 level of $6.5 million. The primary
reasons for the increase in working capital were an increase in cash and inventory and decreases in accounts
payable and accrued expenses.

Eco expects total capital expenditures in 2016 to range from $48 million to $53 million.

**_Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates_**

Eco’s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3, “Summary of Significant Accounting

Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. As disclosed in that note, the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Future events cannot be predicted
with certainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates. The following section describes
Eco’s critical accounting policies.

**_Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts_**

Receivables are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts

receivable reflects the best estimate of losses inherent in accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of
historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence. Accounts
receivable are written off when Eco determines they are uncollectible.

**_Goodwill_**

Eco accounted for the 2014 Acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business

combinations. The purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon
their estimated fair values. The purchase price allocation, which is based on the estimated fair value of net assets
acquired, resulted in Eco recording goodwill of $311.9 million. Eco believes that expected synergies of the
acquisition is the primary reason that contributed to a total purchase price that resulted in the recognition of
goodwill.

Eco has historically assessed the goodwill and the tradename indefinite-lived intangible asset for

impairment on an annual basis at December 31, and also at any other date when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that book value may exceed fair value. During the three months ended December 31,
2015, Eco voluntarily changed its annual impairment assessment date to October 1, for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with its strategic
planning process, preparation of its long-term financial budget and cash flow projections and to ensure annual
testing occurs within one year of the 2014 Acquisition.

Eco believes that this change in measurement date, which represents a change in method of applying an

accounting principle, is preferable under the circumstances, and did not result in the delay, acceleration or
avoidance of an impairment charge. Eco prospectively applied the change to the annual impairment assessment
date beginning October 1, 2015, as there was no impairment assessment performed as of December 31, 2014, as
the Acquisition occurred December 1, 2014. As a result of the impairment testing completed as of October 1,
2015, Eco has determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset.

**_Intangible Assets_**

Intangible assets are carried at cost in the balance sheet, less accumulated amortization if applicable. Major

intangible assets include customer relationships, developed technology and trade name, as well as environmental
permits.

113


-----

Definite lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their expected period of

use. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at least once a year, or more frequently if factors change
that could impact the life of the underlying assets. In the Successor Financial Statements, the estimated useful
lives for customer lists, developed technology and permits, is fifteen years, fourteen years and five years,
respectively. In the Predecessor Financial Statements, the estimated useful life for both the customer relationship
and developed technology intangible assets is fifteen years. The estimated useful lives range five to ten years for
environmental permits.

Definite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events indicate a possible loss. Such

an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible asset.
If the assessment indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the recorded value of the intangible asset,
the carrying amount of the intangible asset is reduced by the estimated cash-flow shortfall on a discounted basis,
and a corresponding loss is recorded. There were no intangible asset impairments recorded during the periods
presented.

**_Environmental Liabilities_**

Eco’s operations are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws

and regulations, which could become more stringent over time. Certain manufacturing sites have an extended
history of industrial use. As is typical in the specialty chemicals business, soil and groundwater contamination
has occurred in the past at certain sites and might occur or be discovered in the future at other sites. Investigation
and remediation or monitoring soil and groundwater contamination is currently in process at certain of these
sites. In addition, Eco is currently involved as a potentially responsible party under federal and state statutes
requiring remediation resulting from past waste disposal practices at certain sites, including inactive sites.
Currently, Eco is participating in environmental assessments, remedial investigations/feasibility studies and
remediation efforts at these and other sites that may involve additional environmental costs in the future.

Periodic analyses are performed for environmental risks and the corresponding provisions. The provisions

are measured to the best of management’s knowledge and applicable regulations, the nature and extent of the
pollution, clean up techniques and other available information.

Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the discovery of new

remedial sites, discovery of new information and scarcity of reliable information pertaining to certain sites,
improvements in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations, numerous possible remedial
techniques and solutions, difficulty in assessing the involvement of and the financial capability of other
potentially responsible parties (including insurers and other indemnities) and the extended time periods over
which remediation occurs. As the environmental contingencies are more clearly determined, it is reasonably
possible that amounts in excess of those amounts already accrued may be necessary and may be material.

Additionally, there is a state mandate to remediate ground soil at one operating site in the event this site is

shut down. There are no plans to sell, shut down or otherwise dispose of this site. Therefore, there is an
indeterminate settlement date for this potential obligation because the range of time over which it may settle is
unknown. Accordingly, a reasonable estimate of the fair value of this potential obligation cannot be made and, as
such, an accrual has not been made.

**_Contingencies_**

There may be legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Accruals are

recorded for contingencies to the extent that their occurrence is probable and that the related liabilities are
estimable. Anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts are only recorded when assured of recovery.
Many factors are considered in making these assessments, including the progress of the case, opinions or views
of legal counsel, prior case law, historical experience or other companies in similar cases, and deemed intent on

114


-----

how to respond. Because litigation and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do
occur, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions. Legal costs are accrued in advance of when they are incurred when such costs are
considered probable and estimable.

There is various pending litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, which include claims for

compensation for civil responsibility for chemical products produced. Based on facts currently available and
discussion with counsel, management is of the opinion that the disposition of these matters will not materially
affect the results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are

shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of the agreement, title and risk of loss have been
transferred, collectability is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.

The Predecessor Financial Statements included deferred revenue related to environmental abatement

arrangements. In connection with the Acquisition, Eco concluded there was no remaining service requirements to
be performed under these former environmental abatement arrangements. As such, no deferred revenue liability
was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation included in the Successor Financial Statements.

**_Employee Benefits_**

In connection with the 2014 Acquisition, Eco assumed the liabilities related to employees who participate in

defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans (the “Plans”) previously sponsored by Solvay.
These Plans are accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for defined benefit pension and other
post-employment plans, and the total cost of the Plans is determined annually by actuarial valuation.

In accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, during 2015 Eco and Solvay completed its review and

concurred on of the calculation of the final accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”). Solvay paid the required
difference between the trust-to-trust plan asset transfer, and the final ABO of $14.9 million through the transfer
of additional funds from its general assets to Eco’s general assets outside of the Plans. Eco then transferred to the
Company’s plan trusts an aggregate of $14.9 million to settle its estimated liability for the Plans. For the year
ended December 31, 2015, Eco recorded approximately $2.9 million in net pension and post-retirement expense
for the current year estimated service costs and interest costs for the Plans.

**_Share-Based Compensation_**

Group Holdings, the ultimate parent of Eco, granted a total of 25,786 Class B Units (the “Grant Units”) to

certain employees, directors and affiliates of Eco at an exercise price of $1 per Grant Unit. Of this amount,
14,419 and 11,367 Grant Units were granted on January 13, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. As of
December 31, 2015, 25,093 Grant Units were outstanding.

Of this total, 10,674 Grant Units granted to employees have two vesting criteria, in which 50% are subject to

time-based vesting criteria and 50% are subject to performance-based criteria. The time-based Grant Units vest in
four equal annual installments on December 1, 2015, December 1, 2016, December 1, 2017, and December 1,
2018. 14,419 Grant Units to directors and affiliates are subject to time-based vesting criteria only, and vest in
four equal annual installments on December 1, 2015, December 1, 2016, December 1, 2017, and December 1,
2018. All of the Grant Units and were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the fair value of
a Grant Unit was $0.448. The key assumptions used in valuing the Grant Units were as follows: expected life of
seven years, expected volatility of 40.27%, risk-free interest rate of 2.02%, and 0.00% annual dividend yield.

115


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2015 compensation expense of $2.3 million, was recorded for the Grant

Units. There was no compensation expense recorded for the time-based Grant Units for the period from inception
(July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014 as such amount was not significant. Unrecognized compensation expense
related to these time-based Grant Units was approximately $6.8 million and is expected to be recognized over the
next three years. The performance-based Grant Units only vest when specific liquidity events occur. As of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, the performance-based criteria of the Grant Units was deemed not probable, thus
no expense for the performance-based Grant Units has been recorded.

**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**

Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates

(“ASU’s”) to the FASB’s ASC. Management considers the applicability and impact of all ASU’s. ASU’s not
listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on
the financial position or results of operations.

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for leases. Under the new

guidance, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for most leases but will recognize expenses similar to
current lease accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a
modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Eco is currently evaluating the
impact that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which provides

guidance for revenue recognition. The standard’s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue
when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional
disclosures. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Eco is
currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.” The standard

requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation. These amendments do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first out
or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is
measured using first-in, first-out or average cost. The requirements of this standard are effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. Eco is
currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its financial statements.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, “Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt

Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.” As described above, the FASB issued ASU 201503, which does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-ofcredit arrangements. ASU 2015-15 adds SEC paragraphs pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement at the
June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) meeting. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within
Update 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, ASU 2015-15 adds language from
the EITF that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset
and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit
arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. Eco
has adopted the requirements of this standard as described above.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period

Adjustments.” The standard will change the requirements for reporting measurement period adjustments to
provisional amounts initially recognized in conjunction with a business combination. Under U.S. GAAP, an

acquiring entity currently is required to retrospectively adjust, in prior period financial statements, the
provisional amounts to reflect new information obtained during the measurement period (a period, which may
not exceed one year from the date of the business combination, during which the acquiring entity may receive
information about the facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have
affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date). Under the new guidance,
adjustments to the provisional amounts will be reflected in the financial statements for the reporting period in
which the adjustments are determined, including by recognizing in current period earnings the full effect of
changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects. The guidance requires that the acquiring entity
either present separately on the face of the current period income statement or disclose in the notes to the current
period financial statement, by line item, the amount of the adjustments made during the current period. The new
guidance for nonpublic entities will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively
to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance with earlier application
permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. Eco has elected to adopt
the requirements of this standard as of December 31, 2015.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Eco is currently exposed to the impact of interest rate changes as borrowings under the Existing Eco Senior

Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at variable interest rates. It is Eco’s policy to enter into interest rate swap
and interest rate cap transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives. Based on Eco’s
exposure to variable rate borrowings at December 31, 2015, a one percent (1%) change in the LIBOR rate above
the LIBOR floor in the Existing Eco Senior Secured Credit Facilities for a period of one year would change the
annual interest expense by approximately $5.0 million.

**_Commodity Price Risk_**

Eco has direct and indirect exposure to certain commodities, principally natural gas and sulfur (including

hydrogen sulfide). In Eco’s regeneration business its exposure to natural gas represented approximately 40% of
its total variable costs for the year ended December 31, 2015. A $1 per ton increase in the cost of natural gas
from current levels would cause the percentage of variable costs to increase to 47%. In Eco’s virgin sulfuric acid
business its exposure to sulfur represented approximately 92% of Eco’s total variable costs for the year ended
December 31, 2015. A $20 per ton increase in the cost of sulfur from current levels would cause the percentage
of variable costs to increase to 93%. Eco typically does not enter into derivate financial instruments to hedge its
commodity price risk and Eco does not currently have long- term supply contracts with key suppliers. However,
the majority of Eco’s customer contracts contain quarterly price adjustments for commodity inputs that protect it
from volatility in commodity prices, as described above in “Pass Through Contracts and Raw Material Inputs.”

**_Performance Chemicals_**

Our Performance Chemicals business is an integrated silicate technology producer with leading supply positions

in North America, Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific. Our Performance Chemicals produces inorganic products
in six main categories: (i) Sodium Silicate, (ii) Specialty Silicas, (iii) Zeolite Products, (iv) Spray Dry Silicates,
(v) Magnesium Silicate and (vi) Other Specialty Chemicals. Our silicate products and solutions and derivative products

120


-----

are used in a variety of end-uses such as adsorbents for surface coatings, clarifying agents for beverages, cleaning
and personal care products. From 2005 to 2015, our Performance Chemicals business achieved a 5.4% sales
CAGR and an 8.6% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR; our ability to grow throughout economic cycles was driven by
the diverse consumer and industrial end-uses for our products, our local relationships and the global scale of our
business. Our products are essential building blocks that impart critical performance characteristics in our
customers’ end-products, yet typically represent a small portion of our customers’ overall end-product costs.
Further, our cost structure and strategically located manufacturing facility network is a key competitive strength
as many of our products have a very limited economic shipping distance.

We are a global player and we believe we have leading positions across our portfolio of products. We expect

favorable industry and competitive conditions to continue as a result of the attractive, environmentally-friendly
attributes of silicates, large investment required to build new production capacity, the lack of cost-effective
substitute chemicals for sodium silicate and the low penetration of imported sodium silicate due to significant
transportation costs and our short delivery cycle times.

Many of our product lines have experienced growth due to our development of new product applications

and new silicate formulations with improved performance characteristics, as well as our expansion into emerging
geographies. New applications and formulations have enabled us to increase our margins in our Performance
Chemicals business. For example, in 2013 we doubled the capacity of our Indonesian facility to address demand
for our precipitated silicas used in toothpaste. We have also leveraged our strong R&D competencies to expand
into higher value-added products and applications from our core silicate and zeolite platforms. For example, we
have developed a zeolite-based titanium dioxide replacement for paints and coatings applications, and we are
working on other innovative applications for our zeolites. We are also selling our sodium silicate to customers for
use in green tires. In addition, we have recently introduced a sodium-silicate product which we believe has
unique performance characteristics that eliminate certain complications that arise in shale drilling. Given the
inorganic nature of our products, we have also benefited from a global trend toward more environmentallyfriendly chemical solutions. Examples include our spray dried silicates for use in reduced or zero phosphate
cleaning products and our silica gels used as blending agents in coatings applications. The following charts show
our Performance Chemicals business’s sales by region and end-use for the year ended December 31, 2015.

**_Silica Catalysts_**

In our Silica Catalysts product group, the majority of products that we sell are used in the production of

HDPE, a high strength and high stiffness polyethylene used in demanding applications such as large-part blow
molding, film and pipes. HDPE demand is expected to continue to grow globally at an average of approximately
5% annually from 2014 to 2019. We expect that capacity additions in Asia will drive near-term growth. In the
longer term, we expect there will be additional HDPE capacity in North America as announced ethylene capacity
comes on-line driven by the U.S. shale gas transformation. We have collaborated closely with major process
licensors to qualify our catalysts in existing and newly licensed HDPE production facilities, and with our key
customers to customize our catalyst products to offer unique HDPE products in their end-uses. Therefore, we
expect our Silica Catalysts product group to grow at a more rapid pace than the overall HDPE industry.

The Silica Catalysts product group is also leveraging its technical expertise to develop new catalyst products

for other end-uses involving new and more efficient pathways for producing industrial chemicals, including
MMA and ethyl acetate, and in the rapidly developing field of converting natural gas to transportation fuel. We
have proven the technical and commercial viability of several of these new products with our customers, have
entered into long-term contracts for certain of them, and expect them to meaningfully contribute to future sales
growth.

-----

**_Specialty Zeolite-Based Catalysts_**

In our Catalyst joint ventures, we produce specialty zeolite-based catalysts that are sold to the emissions

control industry, the petrochemical industry and other areas of the broader chemicals industry. Representative
applications include emissions control catalysts used to remove impurities in gasoline, Light-Duty Diesel
(“LDD”) and HDD; hydrocracking catalysts used to maximize output of higher value middle distillate from
refining of crude oil; specialty catalysts used in de-waxing lubricants and fuel oil; isomerization catalysts which
maximize the output of para-xylene in polyester manufacturing; and chemical synthesis catalysts used to produce
caprolactam, propylene oxide and other materials. We believe that the continued tightening of diesel emissions
standards in the United States, Europe, Japan and eventually in China and India will provide our business
significant and sustained growth opportunities for our emissions control catalyst technology. In addition, we plan
to continue to diversify the applications for our emissions control catalyst technology to non-road and stationary
applications. We have proven the technical and commercial viability of some of these projects, have built strong
customer relationships based on these proven capabilities, and expect that they will meaningfully add to the
future growth of the business.

**_Transportation Safety_**

In the Transportation Safety product group, we manufacture reflective glass beads used in highway and

airport lane markings, guardrails, barriers and delineation. These glass beads are used with a variety of binders
(including waterborne and solvent borne paint, epoxy and many others) to improve lane marking visibility.
Transportation Safety products are primarily sold to federal and state government agencies, municipalities,
highway contractors and airport agencies. Demand for our Transportation Safety products has grown as a result
of increased spending for maintenance and upgrade of existing roads and the construction of new roads by
government agencies around the world. Demand for our Transportation Safety products is principally driven by
replacement demand and new roads. Demand has steadily grown through economic cycles. Single lane markings
are typically funded by taxes on gasoline and are not typically tied to economic cycles or to the state and local
government budgeting process. The U.S. government has taken an active role in implementing regulations and
initiating infrastructure development to improve transportation safety. These regulations are supported by the
government’s emphasis on upgrading the aging U.S. highways, translating into consistent government
expenditure. The Transportation Safety product group accounted for $175.8 million, or 12%, of our pro forma
sales for year ended December 31, 2015.

In the EGM product group, we sell highly-specialized solid and hollow glass spheres and metal coated

particles that are used in a variety of applications such as plastic additives, conductives, metal finishing and other
industrial and consumer applications. When used as plastics additives, these spheres are a cost-effective means to
improve dimensional stability and reduce shrinkage and warping of plastic molded products. Metal coated
spheres provide conductivity in consumer electronic applications. Spheres can be used as blasting media for
cleaning, finishing and peening high performance metals used in automotive, aerospace and other manufactured
products and components. The EGM product group accounted for $115.1 million, or 7%, of our pro forma sales
for the year ended December 31, 2015.

**_Eco_**

Our Eco business is an integrated merchant sulfuric acid producer with the number one supply share

position in the United States in both sulfuric acid regeneration and the production of virgin sulfuric acid for
merchant sales. Eco operates through two principal product groups: Sulfuric Acid Regeneration and Virgin
Sulfuric Acid. Our Sulfuric Acid Regeneration business recycles spent sulfuric acid into fresh sulfuric acid for
continuous supply to the oil refining industry. Refineries utilize sulfuric acid as the primary catalyst in the
alkylation process which produces high octane gasoline blending additives. Our Virgin Sulfuric Acid business
produces high quality virgin acid products from sulfur and other raw materials for supply to a wide range of
industrial end-users in the United States. There are a variety of end-uses for Eco’s products including the nylon,
mining, general industrial and chemicals industries.

We have achieved a 4.1% sales CAGR and a 3.2% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR from 2005 to 2015 in our Eco

business. Our ability to grow throughout economic cycles was driven by our industry-leading integrated product
and service offering and the critical, non-discretionary nature of our product. We believe we operate in a
consolidated industry with attractive fundamentals and significant capital costs associated with new sulfuric acid
plants. Our integrated network of plants and logistics assets, which are integrated into our customers’ supply
chains, are difficult to replicate and provides us with a significant competitive advantage and deeply entrenched
customer relationships. We have established our leading industry share position in merchant sulfuric acid through
a long and continuous operating history and the consistent delivery to our customers via integration into their
supply chains. Our core operating value of “absolute reliability” reflects the critical, non-discretionary aspect of
sulfuric acid usage from the perspective of our customers, who generally cannot operate without consuming
sulfuric acid on a continuous basis.

The Eco business accounted for $382.9 million or 24% of our pro forma sales for the year ended

December 31, 2015.

We recently entered into a contract to convert our Lake Charles refinery from a captive acid plant to one

serving our Sulfuric Acid Regeneration business, which will add $7 million to $8 million to our contribution
margin starting in the second quarter of 2016.

In the Sulfuric Acid Regeneration market, our Eco business holds a 65% market share in the West Coast

region, a 25% market share in the Midwest region and a 61% market share in the Gulf Coast region.

**Geographic Footprint**

We operate 68 manufacturing sites in 16 countries on six continents. With the exception of our sulfuric acid

plants, the majority of our products are produced by fusing raw materials inputs in a high temperature furnace,
and either processing or mixing these fused compounds with other inputs such as water. We are the only
manufacturer of sodium silicates and engineered glass materials producing in each key geographic region: North
America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Silicate plants are spread out locally with a few larger
dedicated units for derivative production. Given this industry structure, our geographic footprint is closely
aligned with our key customers. Our highly-efficient network of plants provides us with a strong competitive
position. This dynamic is amplified by the cost effectiveness of expanding existing capacity to meet customer
needs compared to the cost, delay and permitting complications of building “greenfield” plants.

Further, our Specialty Glass Materials facilities are also strategically positioned in close proximity to our

customers, a competitive advantage in an industry where the ability to provide products “on-demand” is critical;
our extensive manufacturing footprint and close proximity to customers allow us to respond quickly to demand
resulting from unfavorable weather conditions or for short-lead time road development projects.

Our sulfuric acid plants are located in key refining zones, often co-located with or pipeline connected to our

customers, and areas of virgin sulfuric acid demand in the Unites States.

The majority of our sites, excluding our sulfuric acid plants, in North America, Europe, Latin America,

Australia, Thailand and China are ISO-9001 certified and ISO-14000 certified.

**Raw Materials**

Our leading industry position and global scale allow for competitive contracts with suppliers. The major raw

materials that we use include soda ash, sand, ATH, glass cullet, spent sulfuric acid and sulfur. While natural gas

125


-----

is not a direct feedstock for any product, all businesses utilize natural gas powered furnaces to heat raw materials
and create the chemical reactions necessary to produce end-products. We maintain multiple suppliers wherever
possible, hedge exposure to fluctuations in prices for natural gas purchases in the United States, make forward
purchases of natural gas in the United States, Canada, and Europe to mitigate our exposure to price volatility, and
structure our customer contracts to allow for the pass-through of raw material and natural gas costs. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we are unable to pass on increases in raw material prices, including
natural gas, or to retain or replace our key suppliers, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively
affected.” We also maintain a raw material quality audit and qualification program to ensure that the material we
purchase satisfies stringent quality requirements.

The Performance Chemicals business’s major raw materials include soda ash, industrial sand, ATH and

sodium hydroxide. The Catalysts business’s raw materials include sodium silicate, acids and bases, and certain
metals. The key raw material for the Specialty Glass Materials business is cullet, which is glass sourced from
glass recyclers around the world. Cullet is generally in ample supply from local recyclers in the regions in which
we operate. The Eco business’s raw materials include spent sulfuric acid and sulfur. These raw materials, in
general, are widely available.

**Research & Development**

We benefit from the highly-skilled technical capabilities of our employees dedicated to new product

development. We operate five R&D facilities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands
and France. Our R&D activities are directed toward the development of new and improved products, processes,
systems and applications for customers. Our R&D team is organized to support each of the operating businesses
and staffed with experienced scientists, technical service representatives and process engineers with direct
knowledge of the products offered. This business group-oriented team structure provides strong links between
product development, manufacturing and customer specifications. Strong linkage to customer specifications
ensures that product development efforts are timely and relevant to real world requirements, while close ties to
manufacturing ensures that new products can be produced in a profitable manner. Product development activities
are organized into R&D projects that are subjected to regular stage-gate reviews by the business management
team. As a result, our R&D teams are able to reduce the product development time and allow for rapid
introduction of new products. We believe we are one of the only producers in the industries we serve that offers
product development and technical support services on a global basis. Pro forma R&D expenses were
approximately $10.3 million, $9.1 million and $8.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and
2013, respectively.

**Competition**

Some of the industries and geographies in which we operate for the Performance Chemicals, Catalysts,

Specialty Glass Materials and Eco businesses are highly competitive, and this competition could harm our
business and our corresponding results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. The sales dynamics in
Europe and certain Asia-Pacific regions for Performance Chemicals, Catalysts and Specialty Glass Materials are
particularly competitive due to the number of regional competitors. In the Performance Chemicals business, our
competitors range from large international companies, such as OxyChem and W.R. Grace, to a large number of
smaller regional companies of varying sizes. In the Catalysts business, our competitors include Clariant, Tosoh
and W.R. Grace. In the Specialty Glass Materials business, our competitors include Sovitec and Swarco, among
others. In the Eco business our competitors include Chemtrade Logistics, Inc., The Chemours Company and PVS
Chemicals, Inc., for regenerated sulfuric acid and also includes by-product producers, namely U.S. and Canadian
copper, zine and other metal smelters in virgin sulfuric acid.

**Customers**

The average length of our relationships with our top 10 customers is over 50 years. We have over 4,000

customers across our four principal businesses. Our customers include AkzoNobel, Albemarle, Anheuser-Busch
InBev, BASF, Chevron, Colgate-Palmolive, Dow Chemical, Evonik, ExxonMobil, GlaxoSmithKline,
Halliburton, Henkel, Honeywell, INEOS Group, Johnson Matthey, LyondellBasell, Procter & Gamble, Rio Tinto,
SAB Miller, SABIC, Schlumberger, Sherwin-Williams, Umicore, Unilever, W. R. Grace and 3M. Additionally,
we have a diversified customer base, with our top 10 customers representing 25% of pro forma sales for the year
ended December 31, 2015 and no single customer representing more than 4% of pro forma sales for the same
period. However, our Eco business generates a significant portion of its net sales from a small number of
customers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Combined Business.”

**Intellectual Property**

We own or have rights to a large number of patents relating to a large number of products and processes. On

a pro forma worldwide basis, as of December 31, 2015, we own over 50 patented inventions, with approximately
280 patents issued in countries around the world and approximately 145 patent applications pending worldwide
covering more than 15 additional inventions. Our patent portfolio in the aggregate, combined with our trade
secrets, institutional know-how and extensive manufacturing and product experience and knowledge, reinforces
our competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2015, we also owned approximately 530 trademark registrations,
including 72 U.S. trademark registrations and 42 pending trademark applications, including six pending U.S.

127


-----

applications. In addition to our registered and applied-for intellectual property portfolio, we also claimed
ownership in certain trade secrets developed by and used in our business. Including our joint ventures, we are
party to certain arrangements whereby we license in the right to use certain intellectual property rights in
connection with our business.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2015, our domestic and international operations consisted of 2,983 employees, of which

1,432 were employed in the United States and 438 were employed in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. We also have
813 employees throughout Europe, 33 in South Africa and 94 in Indonesia. Our remaining employees are
dispersed throughout the Asia–Pacific region, primarily in Australia, China, Thailand and Japan. As of
December 31, 2015 on a pro forma combined basis, approximately 40% of our employees were represented by a
union or workers council. We believe we have good relationships with our employees and their respective work
councils and/or union representatives.

**Environmental Regulation**

Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and stringent federal, state, local and foreign

environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning, among other things, emissions to the air,
discharges to land, surface, subsurface strata and water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation,
treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous materials. We also are subject to other federal, state, local and
foreign laws and regulations regarding chemical and product safety as well as employee health and safety
matters, including process safety requirements. These laws and regulations may become more stringent over time
and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in significant fines or penalties. For instance,
in November 2015, PADEP issued a $1.7 million fine associated with alleged air emissions violations related to
excessive short term emissions of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, and excessive long term 12-month
rolling sums of the two pollutants, at our Chester, PA, site. We have appealed the alleged violation and
associated fine. We also remain subject to a 2007 Consent Decree that resolves certain alleged Clean Air Act
violations at our seven Eco operating locations involving NSR, PSD, and NSPS obligations under the federal
rules for the pollutants sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid mist. The Consent Decree required Solvay (the owner at
the time) to pay a $2 million penalty and spend approximately $34 million on air pollution controls at our
facilities. Work under the Consent Decree has proceeded since 2007, and, we believe that all of the significant
capital improvements related to the Consent Decree have been completed. One of our operating locations has
been released from the scope of the Consent Decree and we are seeking release of the other locations covered by
the Consent Decree. Finally, these laws and regulations require us to obtain environmental registrations, licenses,
permits, and other approvals in order to operate and can require us to install expensive pollution control
equipment at our facilities or incur other capital expenditures aimed at achieving or maintaining compliance with
such laws and regulations. Due to the Business Combination, many of the business’ permits need to be
transferred or reissued to us. Depending on the permit, this requires either pre or post-closing notification to
regulatory authorities or regulatory authority consent.

Our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production, use, handling, processing, storage

and transportation of significant quantities of hazardous materials. Under certain environmental laws, liability for
the cleanup of contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. We could be held
responsible for all cleanup costs at a site, whether currently or formerly owned or operated, and regardless of
fault, knowledge, timing or cause of the contamination. In addition, we may face liability for personal injury,
property damage, and natural resource damage resulting from environmental conditions attributable to us. As
such, a product spill or emission at one of our facilities or during transportation could have severe consequences
on the environment and surrounding community and could result in significant liabilities with respect to
investigation and remediation. Under certain environmental laws, liability for the cleanup of contaminated sites
can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. As of December 31, 2015, we have current
remediation or monitoring obligations at our sites in Rahway, NJ; Dominguez, CA; Martinez, CA; Hammond,

128


-----

IN; Portland, OR and Rio Claro, Brazil, as well as a formerly owned site in Tacoma, WA. The Martinez facility
also is involved in a long-term project to remediate and restore the Peyton Slough, an adjacent surface water
estuary that was contaminated as a result of historical copper smelting activities on the Martinez site prior to the
acquisition of the property. This project is in its final stages. There also is a potential risk that our long-term
industrial use of these sites may have resulted in yet to be discovered contamination, which we potentially could
be required to investigate and, if warranted, remediate, as liability could be imposed without regard to whether
we knew of, or caused, the release of such hazardous substances and, in some cases, liability may be joint and
several. Discovery of additional or unknown conditions at our facilities could have an adverse impact on our
business by substantially increasing our capital expenditures, compliance or investigation, and remediation costs.
Further, we may be jointly and severally liable for contamination at third party sites where we or our
predecessors in interest have sent waste for treatment or disposal even if in doing so we complied with applicable
laws.

Environmental matters are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the discovery of new remedial

sites, discovery of new information and scarcity of reliable information pertaining to certain sites, improvements
in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations, numerous possible remedial techniques and
solutions, difficulty in assessing the involvement of and the financial capability of other potentially responsible
parties and the extended time periods over which remediation occurs. For environmental matters that are
probable and estimable, we have recorded a reserve as reflected in the financial statements. Our reserves
associated with environmental matters were $9.9 million as of December 31, 2015.

**Chemical Product Regulation**

As a chemical company, we are subject to extensive and evolving regulations regarding the manufacture,

processing, distribution, import, export, and labeling of our products and their raw materials. In the EU, the
REACH regulations went into effect in 2007 with implementation rolling out over time. REACH requires
registration of chemicals, along with a dossier of toxicological and ecotoxicity test results, or a plan to conduct
such tests if currently unavailable. Registered chemicals then can be subject to further evaluation and potential
restrictions. Our high-volume chemicals have been registered under REACH; up to 50 lower-volume chemicals
(mainly catalysts) will be registered by the 2018 deadline. To date, no testing has been required. A couple of our
chemicals are being reviewed under REACH. It is possible this will result in testing requirements, which,
depending on the tests, can cost up to several million dollars. Since the promulgation of REACH, other countries
(e.g., China, Korea, Taiwan) have enacted and are in the process of implementing similar comprehensive
regulation of chemicals. In the United States, legislation is pending that would require the EPA to review and
require testing of certain chemicals. Given knowledge of our chemicals and the various regulations promulgated
to date, we do not anticipate costly testing requirements or severe restrictions, but cannot guarantee that we will
be free of requirements for our products or raw materials that could materially affect our operations. In particular,
some of our products might be characterized as nanomaterials and then subjected to evolving new nanomaterial
regulations.

**Properties**

Our operating headquarters are located in Malvern, Pennsylvania. We are a global company operating 68

manufacturing sites in 16 countries on six continents, including 36 Performance Chemicals manufacturing
facilities in 14 countries, two Catalysts manufacturing facilities in two countries and 24 Specialty Glass Materials
manufacturing facilities in 11 countries throughout the world. We also have 13 administrative facilities and five
R&D facilities in nine countries.

**Legal Proceedings**

As part of the INEOS Silicas acquisition in July 2008, we are liable for potential multi-year UK tax benefits.

We are contractually obligated to make a payment on an annual basis on our UK taxable results, which can
fluctuate period to period, until there is a change in control, as defined in the purchase agreement. As of
December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had accrued $5.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively, for this
matter representing the expected payment owed on the calculation of the liability for the tax year ended 2015 and
2014. We recorded these expenses as transaction-related costs in other operating expense, net.

We are subject to various asbestos premises liability claims, which relate to employee or contractor

exposure to asbestos contained in certain building materials (e.g., insulation) at our sites. We typically are not
named as a single party defendant in these cases and the alleged exposures in cases filed against us tend to be for
a shorter time period (e.g., several weeks or months of exposure at our sites out of a claimed total exposure that
could total 30 years at other sites). Approximately 110 asbestos exposure claims are currently pending. We
completed asbestos abatement from our facilities in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We have a provision on the
balance sheet in relation to these claims.

In addition, our business is involved in other claims and legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal

course of business. No accrual for these matters currently exists, with the exception of those listed above,
because management believes that the liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims are not probable or
reasonably estimable. We are vigorously defending these claims against us and believe we have reserves and
insurance coverage sufficient to cover potential exposures. We do not believe that the liability resulting from
these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position, however, the
outcome of individual matters cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty at this time.

**Performance Chemicals (43% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)**

**_Sodium Silicate (20% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

Sodium silicates are primarily used as building blocks or performance enhancers for other end products in a

wide range of industrial and consumer applications. Sodium silicate production technology is closely held among
major North American and European manufacturers, with only a limited number of producers having a
meaningful portion of merchant sodium silicate sales. The specific processes to produce different silicates and
silicas and their derivatives are proprietary, requiring not only process know-how but significant capital
investment.

Sales of sodium silicate are regional in nature. Products cannot be economically transported long distances

as the value-to-weight ratio and transportation costs become a limiting factor to sustainable profitability. As a
result, silicate plants are spread out locally with a few large dedicated units for derivative production. Given this
industry structure, there are limited imports of sodium silicate.

The uses of silicates span a diverse range of applications, including binders and adhesives, stabilizers,

corrosion inhibiters and metal scavenging, as well as a cost-effective source of alkalinity. Over the past decade,

132


-----

sodium silicate end-uses have shifted from uses such as powdered laundry and virgin pulp and paper production
towards environmentally-friendly alternatives to commonly used chemicals, including fillers for roll-resistant
green tires, coatings for recycled paper, geopolymers and reduced or zero phosphate cleaning products. Further,
silicate and silicate derivatives are recognized on the EPA’s list of Design for the Environment, or the DFE, Safer
Chemicals for use in consumer product production.

Sodium silicate derivatives are also used as intermediates in the production of zeolites, precipitated silicas,

silica gels, colloidal silicas and other derivatives. We believe certain of these derivative products represent the
largest and fastest growing end-use applications for sodium silicate products. Sodium silicate derivative products
are key building blocks for the production of silica catalysts, specialty zeolite-based catalysts, CMP slurries and
adsorbents in a variety of applications.

Based on industry estimates, from 2013 to 2018, both U.S. and global demand for sodium silicates are

expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 2%. We continue to expect near-term volume for cleaning
products, pulp and paper and construction to be consistent with overall economic growth in the United States,
though the displacement of less environmentally-friendly chemicals in some higher value applications will
continue to grow at a higher rate than the underlying end-uses. Generally, we have experienced growth rates in
excess of U.S. real gross domestic product, or GDP, for production of precipitated silica and colloidal silica for
use in tires and the computer chip industry.

**_Specialty Silicas (9% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

Specialty silicas comprise a range of specialty products classified according to their method of preparation,

including silica gels, precipitated silicas, colloidal silica and fumed silica. We manufacture a range of silica gels
and precipitated silica products for a variety of end-use applications.

Silica gels are used as adsorbents in beverage and oil processing applications and as functional ingredients

in paints and coatings, food and ink jet applications. Our major customers for specialty adsorbents include major
breweries, food processors, edible oil refiners and biodiesel producers.

Specialty products serve as adsorbents and clarifiers in the beer production process and we believe are now

used by the majority of beer producers. Consumption of specialty silicas in the brewing industry has been
relatively stable due to overall global beer consumption trends, which have generally shown consistency through
economic cycles. Further, once an adsorbent is specified by a brewer for a specific formulation, it is rare for the
brewer to change the suppliers due to taste uniformity and customer loyalty.

Silica gel adsorbents are also used to selectively remove polar impurities from triglyceride oils for edible

and industrial applications. Uses of silica products in this application offer a number of cost savings and
environmental benefits, while improving quality and yield of the processed oil. We supply adsorbent products for
the purification of feedstock for biodiesel production, allowing biofuels producers to use a wider range of waste
and non-edible oil feedstocks.

Precipitated silica uses include green tire applications, footwear, batteries, food and healthcare products and

agricultural products. In precipitated silicas, we have recently worked with our customers to optimize our
manufacturing process for high whitening and desensitizing toothpaste applications that meet an increasingly
attractive consumer preference where our products are displacing less environmentally-friendly materials and
offering cleaning performance with low abrasion. Growth in this application is driven by rising middle classes in
developing regions and consumer demand for natural ingredients and premium branding.

Based on industry estimates, from 2013 to 2018, global demand for specialty silicas is expected to grow at

an annual rate of approximately 5%, and U.S. demand is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 3%.
Rubber applications, tires and footwear are the leading applications for precipitated silica and the fastest

133


-----

growing. Some of the increase in demand for precipitated silica is primarily based on the trend to use fuelefficient low-resistance tires. The use of silicas with silanes can improve rolling resistance, saving up to 8% of
fuel consumption. These “Green Tires” are composed of rubber, carbon black and silica. However, the silica
consumption in green tires is double the amount in standard tires, replacing carbon black. The global share of
green tires is expected to increase from 15% in 2011 to 34% in 2016 and 40 to 45% by 2018. The volume of
precipitated silica in green tires is projected to grow at more than 6% annually during 2013 to 2018, as compared
to just above 5% annually during 2013 to 2018 in all other applications.

**_Zeolite Products (6% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

Zeolites are produced by combining sodium silicate with aluminum hydroxide and other materials to create

a performance intermediate used in a variety of critical use applications. Zeolites are found in a variety of
commercial products, including adsorbents and detergents. Historically, zeolites were predominantly used as a
key input for the production of detergents. Over the last decade, however, the North American powdered
detergent usage has declined as consumer preferences have shifted away from powder detergents to less zeoliteintensive liquid detergents. Since 2000, the demand for zeolite for detergent applications has decreased. As a
result, we believe we are the major manufacturer of North American zeolites used in detergents due to our
favorable integrated cost position, logistics footprint and capabilities and strong process technology. Zeolites for
detergent end-uses now represent a significantly less meaningful product line within our company, as evidenced
by its decreasing percentage of global sales from 16% of sales in the year ended December 31, 2009 to 8% of
sales in the year ended December 31, 2015.

To address this industry shift which has resulted in available zeolite production capacity, we have

aggressively focused on developing new applications for our zeolite technology. As an example, applications we
have focused on include stabilizers in the production of polyvinylchloride, or PVC, a titanium dioxide
replacement for paints and coatings applications as well as our coatings applications for food grade paper. As we
continue to optimize our product offering alongside customers, we expect that these applications will provide
important growth opportunities.

**_Spray Dry Silicate (2% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

Spray dry silicate is used principally as a soluble solution for consumer cleaning applications. Spray dried

sodium and potassium silicates are used in a variety of industrial, personal care and consumer cleaning. Major
end-uses include refractory, cleaning compounds, oil processing, hair bleach, fire retardants, water treatment,
adhesive, geopolymers and drilling fluids for oil and gas wells.

**_Magnesium Silicate (1% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

Based on industry estimates, from 2013 and 2018, both U.S. and global demand for magnesium silicate are

expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 2%. Magnesium silicates are amorphous, water-insoluble
powders precipitated from sodium silicate solutions, which function as specialty carriers (especially of oils),
flow-control agents and fillers.

Although the end-uses for magnesium silicate are currently small in size, we expect significant growth in

magnesium silicate demand in the coming years due to increasing use of frying oils in Asia (e.g., international
fast-food chains expanding in China). We expect substantial growth within several years and are expanding
production of magnesium silicate in plants in France and the Netherlands.

**Catalysts (14% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)**

**_Silica Catalysts (4% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

The silica catalysts we produce are principally used in the production of HDPE, MMA and the synthesis of

other organic materials. HDPE is utilized in the manufacturing of plastic containers, pipes, wire and cable

134


-----

claddings, films for bags and geo-membranes, gas and sewer and a variety of other applications. According to
industry sources, global HDPE consumption is expected to grow by approximately 5% annually from 2014 to
2019 and will be driven by the general level of economic activity and the increased utilization of HDPE as a
substitute for heavier and more expensive materials such as glass and metals. Further, we believe that we will
disproportionately benefit from the increased HDPE capacity coming on stream in the United States, where we
believe our position is strong, as a result of resin producers benefitting from advantageous feedstock sources
derived from the favorable U.S. shale gas position.

Typically, these catalysts are specified by process licensors to produce resins with specific properties. As a

result, these catalysts are often covered under long-term supply agreements and we are often our customers’ sole
source supplier. Catalyst products are typically developed alongside end-users, with significant upfront time
required in order to ensure that specifications are appropriately met.

Silica catalysts are also sold for chemical synthesis uses. For example, we are the supplier of catalyst to a

leading producer of MMA for use in its proprietary MMA production process. MMA is a clear, scratch-resistant
plastic that is used in sheet-form to replace glass, surface coatings and molding compounds. According to
industry sources, the demand for MMA is expected to grow by approximately 3% annually from 2014 to 2019.

We continue to prudently invest in new applications for our high growth and high margin catalysts. We are

developing catalyst technology for use in gas-to-liquid conversion and other organic synthesis applications with
select customers and will invest in these new technologies in a disciplined fashion as we see the commercial
viability and user acceptance.

**_Specialty Zeolite-Based Catalysts (10% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

Favorable industry dynamics, including (i) stringent emissions control standards and recovery in LDD &

HDD engine production, (ii) increase in nylon demand in Asia, and (iii) increase in refinery capacity, especially
for processing low-grade crude oil, are driving strong demand growth for specialty zeolite-based catalysts.

As global awareness and action against environmental issues posed by pollution / emissions from stationary

and mobile sources has risen, so has the importance of emissions control catalysts. The tightening of emissions
standards in the U.S., continual tightening in Europe, and the planned tightening in Japan and Korea for LDD and
HDD engines have contributed to meaningful demand growth for specialty zeolite-based catalysts in recent years
and will continue to support growth in the future.

Increasing regulations in both on and off-road heavy duty diesel engines is expected over the next years,

including regulations related to the Euro VI emissions standards issued by the European Union. Despite limited
regulations in emerging markets, major HDD engine producers are likely to adopt a globally regulated engine
model.

New legislative trends will affect production of heavy duty diesel vehicle regulated engines. Within Europe,

post the implementation of Euro VI, there are advanced discussions regarding U.S. GHG type legislation. The
expectation is that the introduction in 2019 to 2020 of stricter Stage V emission limits for non-road machinery
will increase demand for catalysts. In Asia, China’s Euro IV nationwide from January 2015 has driven volumes.
Between 2014 and 2020, industry sources estimate global HDD engine production growth of approximately 11%.
North America expects GHG regulations to tighten in 2020 and tighter NOx standards may be implemented.
Hence, growth there is expected to be slower.

New legislative trends will affect production of light duty vehicle regulated engines as well. Regulations

including Euro VIb, for diesel engines, and Euro VIc, for gasoline engines are expected to drive catalyst sales
growth. North America Tier 3 regulations are on track for 2017 implementation with expected associated LDD
engine growth to be moderate. Between 2014 and 2020, industry sources estimate global LDD engine production
growth of approximately 4%.

Caprolactam is an organic compound that is an intermediate in the production of nylon. We produce a

custom product / catalyst called titanium silicate or TS-1 that is used in the catalytic process to produce
caprolactam. TS-1 use in the production of caprolactam is a key component in the “green” redesigned
manufacturing process of nylon, particularly in the developing world. As of 2013, Chinese customers represented
a 33%, and growing, share of global caprolactam demand. According to industry sources, Chinese demand for
caprolactam is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 8% from 2013 to 2018.

Oil refinery cracking processes enable the production of gasoline and other lighter products from sour,

heavier crude oil and residues. Hydrocracking is a major source for producing diesel fuel, jet fuel, gasoline
components and liquefied petroleum gas. The rate of cracking and the end-products produced are strongly
dependent on the temperature and presence of hydrocracking catalysts. Through Zeolyst International, we
provide various specialty zeolite-based hydrocracking catalysts that deliver an excellent balance between the
desired yield targets, product properties and extended lives.

We sell hydrocracking catalysts to oil refineries and other petrochemical manufacturers as a consumable

that must be replaced on a periodic basis (every three to five years).

Although the input costs of hydrocracking catalysts are small when compared to the overall variable raw

material costs for operating a refinery, the impact to a refiner for utilizing low quality or contaminated catalysts
could be extremely high. As a result, refiners choose to purchase high quality catalysts from well-known
manufacturers, and typically value performance and reliability over price when making buying decisions. Global
demand for the critical hydrocracking process is expected to continue to drive the demand for hydrocracking
catalysts.

In addition to hydrocracking catalysts, we also produce specialty and custom catalysts which are primarily

developed for paraxylene isomerization, upstream intermediates in the manufacturing of polyester and
isobutylene isomerization for the production of methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, a fuel oxygenator.

Another important area of growth for specialty zeolite-based catalytic technology is in gas-to-liquid

conversion. With the improvement in natural gas drilling techniques and large natural gas discoveries in North
America, there are opportunities to use catalysts in patented technologies that convert natural gas to chemical
components that would otherwise require naptha as a precursor.

**Specialty Glass Materials (19% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)**

Our Specialty Glass Materials business produces glass beads for use in transportation safety as well as for a

range of consumer electronic, automotive and construction applications. Our Specialty Glass Materials business
uses a variety of methods to manufacture its beads, depending on the end-use application. For both
Transportation Safety products and other engineered glass products, our Specialty Glass Materials business
begins by crushing raw materials (e.g., glass cullet), forming beads in a furnace and then finally coating or
treating the beads to meet end customer specifications. The beads are then collected, bagged and stocked for
shipment. See the figure below for our Specialty Glass Materials business’s production process:

Highway safety spending is characterized by the following key trends and growth drivers: predictable,

ongoing replacement demand, infrastructure spending, increased public awareness of the social and taxpayer
costs of highway fatalities, wider lines, brighter lines, edge lines, double lines and product innovation. We expect
highway safety to benefit substantially over the next several years from U.S. government highway spending
fueled by factors such as (i) the aging U.S. highway system, (ii) increased government focus on the reduction of
driving-related injuries and fatalities, (iii) the aging of the U.S. population, which increases the need for greater
line visibility, and (iv) increased public awareness of the costs associated with such injuries and fatalities. Strong
demand from international sources is expected as a result of growth in construction of road infrastructure in
developing economies, such as Eastern Europe and Asia, as well as road maintenance spending in developed
nations.

U.S. federal highway spending has increased thirteen of the past fifteen years and is expected to grow at a

2.18% CAGR between 2015 and 2020, driven by the aging of the U.S. population and the government’s
increased focus on highway safety. A significant percentage of our Highway Safety sales result from the upgrade
of existing roads with new engineered glass. Furthermore, road maintenance and road construction spending has

-----

historically been resilient during economic downturns as they are often utilized as a form of government
stimulus. Based on industry estimates, North American public highway and highway safety spending is expected
to grow at an annual rate of approximately 5% per year through 2018.

We are the industry leader in Highway Safety products in the Americas as a result of our leading products

and technology, key strategic acquisitions and commitment to service. Europe remains more fragmented relative
to North America. PQ, Sovitec and Swarco have a large combined share followed by Chinese imports, which
supply the remaining portion. We believe that there are ample consolidation opportunities in the more
fragmented European region in the near to medium-term. Chinese imports currently represent a small share of the
North American and Latin America regions and a larger share of Asia.

**_Engineered Glass Materials (7% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

EGM products are highly-specialized solid and hollow glass spheres and metal coated particles used in

conductive materials, polymer additive and metal finishing end-uses.

These highly-specialized solid and hollow glass spheres are used as a low-cost, lightweight and anti-warping

additive in polymer compounds used in plastics manufacturing. Certain spheres are reduced to be used in water
soluble or insoluble applications. Other applications include industrial explosives, oil and gas drilling mud and a
variety of other industrial and consumer applications.

In industrial finishing processes, engineered glass materials are propelled from blasting equipment to clean,

peen, debur and finish items such as airplane and turbine compressor blades and other specialized parts. Peening
offers engineers the ability to design lighter, thinner parts while maintaining part strength. Glass impact spheres
are a preferred substitute for other products such as industrial sand, aluminum oxide, iron or steel, as they allow
for better process control, limit surface contamination and are environmentally-friendly. Conductive particles are
used in consumer, industrial, medical and military electronics devices.

Growth in polymer additives is driven by increased demand for high value-added polymers requiring unique

surface and strength/weight considerations. Demand for conductive materials is driven by new applications for
telecommunication infrastructure and other consumer electronics. Recovery in manufacturing, mining, oil and
gas and energy drilling activity is expected to drive increased demand for our EGM products.

**Eco Overview**

**Eco (24% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)**

Sulfuric acid is one of the largest-volume industrial chemicals produced in the world, with the United States

accounting for approximately 16% of global production. It is generally used as a process chemical (for example,
it is used as an acidulating agent, catalyst and dehydrating agent) or in some similar function. Its wide use in
these functions is due largely to its low cost. It is an important raw material in the manufacture of phosphate
fertilizers. Since sulfuric acid is not “consumed” as a reactant in many of its uses, substantial quantities of
contaminated waste acid and/or sulfate salts remain as by-products of various processes. Some waste acid can be
reused or used as feedstock at sulfuric acid plants capable of burning sludge.

We are the leading producer of merchant sulfuric acid in the United States, the largest chemical product

used in the United States by volume, with an operating history dating to the 1880s. We hold the number one
supply share position in the United States in both sulfuric acid regeneration and the production of virgin sulfuric
acid for merchant sales. Sulfuric acid regeneration is the process of recycling spent sulfuric acid into fresh
sulfuric acid for continuous supply to the oil refining industry, which uses sulfuric acid in the production of
alkylates for gasoline blending. Virgin sulfuric acid is created by manufacturing sulfuric acid products from
sulfur and other raw materials. It is used for supply to a wide range of industrial end-users, including the nylon,
mining, general industrial and chemicals industries.

**_Sulfuric Acid Regeneration (12% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

Sulfuric acid serves as a key catalyst for refineries in the production of alkylate, a component in gasoline

blending. Alkylate is considered to be the best blending component for gasoline because of its superior ability to
boost octane and its low vapor pressure relative to substitutes such as ethanol and butane. As of 2014,
approximately 45-50% of North American refineries with alkylation capability refining capacity of over 100,000
BPD utilized sulfuric acid alkylation technology and approximately 52% utilize hydrofluoric acid alkylation
technology. Sulfuric acid alkylation is the preferred technology from a health, safety, and environmental
perspective, but the switching costs to change from one alkylation technology to another is extremely high. No
refinery in North America has made the transition from using hydrofluoric acid alkylation to using sulfuric acid
alkylation. Sulfuric acid alkylation is typically utilized in larger refineries with alkylation units using sulfuric
acid as the key catalyst in the alkylation of olefins with isobutane. Once used in an alkylation unit, the sulfuric
acid becomes diluted with water and hydrocarbons, becoming “spent” and needing to be recycled. From a
regulatory standpoint, sulfuric acid regeneration is the only feasible way for refineries to manage their spent acid
and receive fresh acid for reuse in their alkylation processes. Since storage of fresh and spent acid is limited, and
the cost to refineries of interruption to their alkylation units is prohibitive, refiners require a continuous and
reliable sulfuric acid supply chain. By providing regeneration services, as well as purchasing by-product sulfur
from customers for use in manufacturing fresh acid, we play an integral part in managing the sulfuric acid supply
chains of our refining customers.

There are a number of positive drivers which we believe will increase future demand for alkylate and

refined products, including, increased U.S. exports of refined product given the lower cost position created by
cheaper natural gas and domestic oil, increased refining of shale oil will require more alkylate blending to
achieve desired octane levels, increased use of C3 (propylene) and C5 (amylene) (vs. C4 (butylene)) olefin
feedstock for alkylation units because of the availability of natural gas liquid by-products from shale drilling,
Tier 3 regulatory standards on vehicle efficiency and gasoline sulfur content drive demand for alkylate and
alkylate substitutes ethanol and butane hitting blending limits.

The industry structure is compelling for incumbents, with significant capital costs required for new

regeneration plants, supply chains already consolidated among the major players via captive pipeline connections
and transport links, and significant local, regional and state permitting hurdles in place for any new contemplated

plant construction. We are the largest producer of regenerated sulfuric acid in the United States with
approximately 52% of the supply share. Regeneration producers compete on the basis of price, reliability, and
responsiveness to changes in customer demand, which is a function of scale, proximity to customer locations and
operational expertise.

**_Virgin Sulfuric Acid (11% of Pro Forma Combined FY 2015 Sales)_**

Sulfuric acid is created either through the burning of sulfur in furnaces, or as a by-product of other industrial

processes, primarily the smelting of copper and other base metals. We produce a range of virgin sulfuric acid
products by burning sulfur in our plants for supply to diverse end-uses. Sulfur-burned acid is generally of higher
purity and quality than smelter-produced acid. Smelter-produced acid is not suitable for some industrial users
including several of our larger customers who require high quality and differentiated sulfuric acid products, such
as super-saturated sulfuric acid (oleum) and other high purity specialty acids. Virgin sulfuric acid and
regenerated sulfuric acid are manufactured in our regeneration plants utilizing the same production equipment;
we also have one facility in Houston that only produces virgin sulfuric acid from sulfur.

Based on industry estimates, global consumption of sulfuric acid ex-fertilizer and petroleum is expected to

grow at an annual rate of approximately 3% between 2015 and 2020.

We are the largest producer of virgin sulfuric acid for U.S. merchant sales, with approximately 19% total

supply share. Amongst U.S. sulfur-burned virgin sulfuric acid producers, we have the number one merchant
seller position, at approximately 40%. Our addressable virgin sulfuric acid supply position comprises refinery
make-up volumes and the broader chemical, agricultural and industrial end-uses. Virgin sulfuric acid suppliers
compete for merchant sales on the basis of quality, reliability and price, with many larger users of sulfuric acid
requiring high quality products, reliability of supply, and responsiveness to ensure continuity of operations.
Generally, the industry is segmented by geography, since the costs of transporting acid are high. We believe there
will be increased future demand for virgin sulfuric acid in the United States, particularly in the Gulf region as
investment in the petrochemical industry in that region is anticipated to result in an increased need for virgin
sulfuric acid.

Loan Parties’ eligible inventory and (y) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of the Canadian
Loan Parties’ eligible inventory, plus

perfected lien in favor of the Revolving Agent and restrictions on the Canadian Loan Parties’ ability to
access the cash, in an aggregate amount not to exceed an agreed limit.

Availability under the European ABL Facility will be limited to the lesser of the applicable sublimit and a

borrowing base (the “European Borrowing Base”, together with the U.S. Borrowing Base and Canadian
Borrowing Base, the “Borrowing Base”) equal to the sum (subject to certain reserves and other adjustments) of:

   - 85% of certain loan parties’ organized under the laws of the Netherlands or the United Kingdom (the

“European Loan Parties”) eligible accounts receivable, plus

   - the lesser of (x) 70% of the book value (calculated as the lower of cost or market value) of the European

perfected lien in favor of the Revolving Agent and restrictions on the European Loan Parties’ ability to

The New ABL Facility will provide the Revolving Agent customary discretion to impose reserves or

availability blocks, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to
us, the U.S. Loan Parties, the Canadian Loan Parties and the European Loan Parties and may require us, the U.S.
Loan Parties, the Canadian Loan Parties and the European Loan Parties to repay certain amounts outstanding
under the New ABL Facility.

The New ABL Facility is expected to provide that, after the consummation of the Business Combination, we

may request increases to the New ABL Facility and/or add one or more incremental revolving facilities in an
aggregate principal amount not to exceed (w) the greater of (1) $50.0 million and (2) an amount equal to the
difference between the sum of each Borrowing Base and the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, so long as, on
a pro forma basis, the total net leverage ratio does not exceed the total net leverage on the Closing Date plus
(x) in the case of any incremental facilities that serve to effectively replace any commitment under the New ABL
Facility that is terminated under the “yank-a-bank” provisions, an amount equal to the portion of the relevant
terminated commitment plus (y) the amount of any permanent voluntary reduction of the commitments under the
New ABL Facility and/or any incremental revolving facility. The existing lenders under the New ABL Facility
will not be under any obligation to provide such additional commitments, and any increase in commitments is
subject to customary conditions precedent.

Additional borrowings under the New ABL Facility will be subject to the satisfaction of customary

conditions, including absence of events of default, accuracy of representations and warranties in all material
respects and availability.

_New Term Loan Facility._ Availability of the New Term Loan Facility on the Closing Date will be subject

to specified conditions precedent, including the consummation of the Business Combination. Subject to the
satisfaction of these conditions, we expect to draw the full amount of the New Term Loan Facility upon
consummation of the Business Combination to finance a portion of the Business Combination, the refinancing
and the other related transactions contemplated hereby and the payment of related fees, expenses and other costs.

The New Term Loan Facility is expected to provide that, after the consummation of the Business

Combination, we may request increases to (a) the New Term Loan Facility and/or add one or more incremental

term loan facilities and/or (b) add one or more incremental cash-flow revolving facilities and/or increase
commitments under any then existing incremental cash-flow revolving facilities (each, an “Incremental Cash
Flow Revolving Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed (w) $200.0 million, plus (x) in the case
of any incremental facilities that serve to effectively extend the maturity of the New Term Loan Facility and/or
Incremental Cash Flow Revolving Facility, an amount equal to the reductions in the New Term Loan Facility
and/or Incremental Cash Flow Revolving Facility to be replaced thereby plus (y) the amount of certain voluntary
prepayment of the term loans under the New Term Loan Facility and/or any incremental term facility and/or any
permanent reduction of the commitments under any Incremental Cash Flow Revolving Facility and plus (z) an
unlimited amount so long as (1) if such indebtedness is secured on a pari passu basis with the New Term Loan
Facility, we are in compliance on a pro forma basis with a senior secured net leverage ratio of no greater than
3.75:1.00, (2) if such indebtedness is secured by a lien that is junior to the lien securing the New Term Loan
Facility, we are in compliance on a pro forma basis with a secured net leverage ratio of no greater than 4.70:1.00
and (3) if such indebtedness is unsecured, we are in compliance on a pro forma basis with a total net leverage
ratio of no greater than 3.75:1.00 leverage ratio as of the closing date. The existing lenders under the New Term
Loan Facility will not be under any obligation to provide such additional commitments.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

_New ABL Facility:_ The interest rates applicable to loans under the New ABL Facility denominated in

(a) U.S. dollars are equal to an applicable interest rate margin, plus, at our option, either (1) a base rate (the “Base

Loan Facility, a 1.00% call protection premium applicable to certain “repricing transactions” occurring on or
prior to the date that is twelve months after the Closing Date.

**_Amortization and Final Maturity_**

All outstanding revolving loans under the New ABL Facility are due and payable in full upon the expiration

of its five-year term. In the case of the term loans borrowed under the New Term Loan Facility, we will be
required to make scheduled quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans
made on the closing date of the Business Combination, with the balance due on the 6.5 year anniversary of such
closing date.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

All obligations under our New ABL Facility and New Term Loan Facility will be each unconditionally

guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior basis by: (i) in the case of the New Term Loan Facility, Holdings,
certain of our existing and future direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the “U.S.

exceptions), PQ Corporation and the U.S. Guarantors; and (iv) in the case of the European ABL Facility, by each
of the European ABL Facility borrower’s wholly owned subsidiaries organized under the laws of the Netherlands
or the United Kingdom (subject to customary exceptions), PQ Corporation and the U.S. Guarantors.

All obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility, the Canadian ABL Facility, the European ABL Facility and the

New Term Loan Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, will be secured, subject to certain exceptions,
by substantially all of the assets of the borrowers under each such facility and the assets of the respective
guarantors under each such facility.

149


-----

The assets securing the U.S. ABL Facility, the Canadian ABL Facility and the European ABL Facility (the

“ABL Collateral”) will include a first priority (subject to permitted liens and other exceptions) security interest in
personal property consisting of accounts receivable, inventory, cash and cash equivalents (other than cash and
cash equivalents constituting proceeds of Term Loan Collateral (as defined below), cash collateral subject to
certain permitted liens or certain identifiable tax and trust funds), deposit accounts and securities accounts (other
than any deposit account or securities account established solely to hold identified proceeds of Term Loan
Collateral), and general intangibles, instruments, chattel paper, documents, commercial tort claims, letter of

to the extent related to the foregoing, and, in each case, proceeds thereof, subject to customary exceptions.

The Term Loan Facility is secured by a second priority lien on and security interest in the ABL Collateral

securing the U.S. ABL Facility.

The assets securing the New Term Loan Facility (the “Term Loan Collateral”) will include a first priority

security interest (subject to permitted liens and other exceptions) on 100% of the present and future shares of
capital stock in our subsidiaries and the subsidiary guarantors thereunder (but limited in the case of the voting

substantially all of its assets consist of the equity and/or debt of one or more direct or indirect foreign
subsidiaries, to 65% of such capital stock), substantially all of our and the subsidiary guarantors’ material owned
real property and equipment and all other personal property of us and the subsidiary guarantors to the extent not

(other than those relating to collateral securing the ABL Facility on a first priority basis), patents, copyrights,
trademarks, other general intangibles, intercompany notes and proceeds of the foregoing, subject to customary

The New ABL Facility is secured by a second priority lien on and security interest in the Term Loan

Collateral.

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

Holdings shall also be subject to a “passive holding company” covenant under the New ABL Facility and

the New Term Loan Facility.

In addition, the New ABL Facility will contain a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a 1.0 to 1.0

minimum trailing four quarter fixed charge coverage ratio, to be tested at any time that either (a) excess
availability under the New ABL Facility decreases to a level below the greater of 10% of the Line Cap (as
defined below) and $20.0 million and (b) availability under the U.S. ABL Facility is less than $15.0 million until
the date on which (x) excess availability exceeds the greater of 10 % of the Line Cap and $20.0 million for 30
consecutive days and (y) availability under the U.S. ABL Facility for each day over a 30 consecutive day period
has been equal to or greater than $15.0 million. As used herein “Line Cap” means the lesser of (i) the Aggregate
Revolving Commitments and (ii) the sum of the then-applicable U.S. Borrowing Base, the then-applicable
Canadian Borrowing Base and the then-applicable European Borrowing Base.

The New ABL Facility and the New Term Loan Facility will also contain certain customary representations

defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to certain material
indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy, certain events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, material judgments and changes of control.

**New Senior Unsecured Notes**

In connection with the Business Combination, we expect to issue $625 million aggregate principal amount

of New Senior Unsecured Notes in a concurrent private placement exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. The New Senior Unsecured Notes will mature on May 1, 2022; provided that if the 2022
Notes have been refinanced or otherwise repaid prior to such date, the New Senior Unsecured Notes will instead
mature on May 2, 2023. Interest on the New Senior Unsecured Notes will be paid and reset quarterly and the
New Senior Unsecured Notes will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 10.75% per
year, with a 1.0% LIBOR floor. The New Senior Unsecured Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the
Company and the Guarantors.

The New Senior Unsecured Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 2,

2018 on specified redemption dates and at the redemption prices set forth below, if redeemed during the twelvemonth period beginning on May 2 or each of the years indicated below:

cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof.

We may also redeem some or all of the New Senior Unsecured Notes before May 2, 2018 at a redemption

price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date,
plus a “make whole” premium.

We may be required to make an offer to purchase the New Senior Unsecured Notes at par upon the sale of

certain assets, subject to customary reinvestment rights, and upon a Change of Control at the redemption prices
set forth below, if a Change of Control occurs during the twelve-month period beginning on May 2 of each of the

The agreement governing the New Senior Unsecured Notes is expected to contain customary negative

covenants, subject to customary exceptions, that will limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries
to, among other things, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness (including guarantees thereof),
incur liens on assets, pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital
stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness, make certain investments or other restricted payments, allow certain
restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends, make other payments to us or sell or
transfer assets engage in transactions with affiliates and sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into
other companies.

**_Terms subject to change_**

The terms described above with respect to the New ABL Facility, the New Term Loan Facility and the New

Senior Unsecured Notes are subject to change, and such changes may be material, and to a number of conditions,
including the consummation of the Business Combination. To the extent that any of these conditions are not
satisfied, the New ABL Facility, the New Term Loan Facility and the New Senior Unsecured Notes may not be
available on the terms described herein.

**2022 Notes**

In October 2014, Eco, together with Eco Finance Corp. issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of

its 8.5% Senior Notes due 2022. The 2022 Notes have a maturity date of November 1, 2022. The 2022 Notes pay
interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Following the Business
Combination, PQ Corporation will assume Eco’s obligations under the 2022 Notes and each entity that
guarantees PQ Corporation’s obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will guarantee the 2022
Notes.

The 2022 Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after November 1, 2017 on specified

redemption dates and at the redemption prices. In addition, we may redeem up to 40% of the 2022 Notes before
November 1, 2017 with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings.

We may also redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes before November 1, 2017 at a redemption price of 100%

of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a “make
whole” premium. We may be required to make an offer to purchase the 2022 Notes upon the sale of certain assets
and upon a change of control. The Business Combination does not constitute a Change of Control (as defined in
the indenture governing the 2022 Notes) and therefore we have no obligation to offer to purchase the 2022 Notes
in connection with the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding 2022 Notes was $200.0 million.

The indenture governing the 2022 notes contains certain negative covenants that, subject to exceptions, will

limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur, assume or permit to
exist additional indebtedness (including guarantees thereof), incur liens on assets, pay dividends or certain other

distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness, make
certain investments or other restricted payments, allow certain restrictions on the ability of our restricted
subsidiaries to pay dividends, make other payments to us or sell or transfer assets engage in transactions with
affiliates and sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies.

**_New Markets Tax Credits Financing_**

On October 24, 2013, the Company’s indirect subsidiary Potters entered into a NMTC financing

arrangement with Chase and TX CDE, whereby Chase agreed to contribute $6.6 million and an additional
$15.6 million in funds lent to Chase by Potters Holdings II, L.P. to TX CDE. TX CDE, in turn, lent
$21.0 million in the form of $5.4 million and $15.6 million notes (the “Loans”), to Potters, which used the
proceeds of the Loans to finance the expansion of Potters’ manufacturing facility in Paris, Texas. The
$21.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The capital expenditures associated with
the NMTC were completed in 2014. These Loans are secured by a third lien position behind the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “Certain Definitions.” In this

description, (i) the terms “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to PQ Corporation (and any successor entity, the
“Company”) and its consolidated Subsidiaries and (ii) the terms “Issuer” and “Company” refer only to the
Company and not any of its Affiliates.

The Issuer will issue $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior secured notes due 2022 (the

“Notes”) under an indenture to be dated, 2016 (the “Indenture”) among the Issuer, the Guarantors

and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and as collateral agent (the “Collateral
_Agent”). The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the_
Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” The Indenture will not be subject to the provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the

Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the provisions thereof, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We
urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents because
those agreements, and not this description, will define your rights as a Holder of the Notes. You may request
copies of the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents at our address set
forth under the heading “Where You Can Find More Information.”

**Brief Description of Notes**

The Notes will be:

   - general senior obligations of the Issuer;

   - pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness (including

indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the ABL Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes
and the Existing Senior Notes) of the Issuer;

   - pari passu with all existing and future unsubordinated Indebtedness secured by a first priority Lien on the

Notes Priority Collateral securing indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement on a first priority
basis;

   - effectively senior to all existing and future unsubordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not secured

by a first priority Lien on the Collateral, to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to
any senior Lien on the Collateral);

   - effectively subordinated to the existing and future obligations under the ABL Facility to the extent of the

value of the ABL Collateral;

   - senior in right of payment to all Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer; and

   - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities, including

preferred stock, of the Company’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

**Guarantees**

Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries that guarantee the Term Loan Credit Agreement will initially

guarantee the Notes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.”

Each of the Guarantees of the Notes will be a general senior secured obligation of each Guarantor and will

be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor

154


-----

(including such Guarantor’s guarantee of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the ABL Credit Agreement, the
Unsecured Notes and the Existing Senior Notes), will be effectively senior to all existing and future
unsubordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not secured by a first priority Lien on the Notes Priority
Collateral, to the extent of the value of the Notes Priority Collateral, will be pari passu with all existing and
future unsubordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor secured by a first priority Lien on the Notes Priority
Collateral (including indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement), will be effectively subordinated to
the existing and future obligations of such Guarantor under the ABL Facility to the extent of the value of the
ABL Collateral, and will be senior in right of payment to all Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor. The
Guarantee of any Guarantor will be structurally subordinated to Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of such Guarantor
that do not Guarantee the Notes.

Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or

reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of
their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Your claims to our assets will be structurally subordinated to all of
the creditors of any non-guarantor subsidiaries.”

The obligations of each Guarantor (other than Holdings or any other company that is a direct or indirect

parent of the Company) under its Guarantee will be limited to the extent enforceable as necessary to prevent such
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or transfer under applicable law or case law (including
legal restrictions to make distributions or to provide other benefits to direct or indirect shareholders) or as
necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors, including voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally or other considerations under applicable law.

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all

guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to
such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective maximum liability of all the
Guarantors at the time of such payment.

The Indenture will provide that each Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with

or into or sell its assets to the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor without limitation, or with other Persons
upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale
of All or Substantially All Assets.”

If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness

(including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such
indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Notes or any
guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.”

A Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and

unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(1) any sale, exchange, disposition or transfer (including through consolidation, merger or otherwise) of

(a) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary, or (b) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including to the
Issuer or another Subsidiary Guarantor), which sale, exchange, disposition or transfer in each case is not
prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(2) other than as a result of the repayment in full of the Term Loan Credit Agreement (a) the release,

discharge or termination of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, or

155


-----

(b) the release or discharge of such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such guarantee, in each case
except a release, discharge or termination by or as a result of payment under such guarantee;

(3) the permitted designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted

Subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture;

(4) the consolidation or merger of any Subsidiary Guarantor with and into the Company or another

Subsidiary Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such consolidation or merger, or upon the liquidation of such
Subsidiary Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets to the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor;
or

(5) the Issuer exercising its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “Legal

Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture being discharged in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any guarantee by Holdings or any direct or indirect parent company may be

automatically and unconditionally released and discharged for any reason.

The Guarantee by Holdings and its subsidiary, CPQ Midco I Corporation (“CPQ”) are being provided solely

for the purpose of allowing the Company to satisfy its reporting obligations under the Indenture governing the
Notes by furnishing financial information relating to Holdings instead of the Company. Neither Holdings nor
CPQ will be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and you should not assign any value to such
Guarantees.

**Ranking**

The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes and the payment of any

Guarantee will rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future unsubordinated Indebtedness of the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations of the Issuer and such Guarantor
under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Unsecured Notes and the Existing Senior Notes.

The Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and each

Guarantor’s existing and future unsubordinated Indebtedness that are not secured by a first priority Lien on the
Collateral, to the extent of the value of the Collateral. The Notes and the Guarantees will rank pari passu with all
existing and future unsubordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor secured by a first priority Lien on the
Collateral (including the Term Loan Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement). As of December 31, 2015,
on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Company would have had $2,549 million of
senior indebtedness outstanding (including the Notes and Unsecured Notes), $1,722 million of senior Secured
Indebtedness, comprised of $1,200 million outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and $500 million
of Notes, $21 million related to IRB Transactions and $1.2 million of capital leases. In addition, as of the same
date, we would have had (1) approximately $200 million of availability under the $200 million ABL Credit
Agreement, subject to certain limitations (excluding $5.3 million of outstanding letters of credit as of
December 31, 2015) and (2) the option to raise up to $200 million of additional incremental term loans under the
Term Loan Credit Agreement plus an unlimited amount subject to compliance with certain ratios and up to $50
million of incremental revolving loans under the ABL Credit Agreement plus an unlimited amount subject to
compliance with certain ratios which, if borrowed, would be Secured Indebtedness.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and

the Guarantors may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and,
in any case, such Indebtedness may be senior indebtedness. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence
of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

-----

**Security**

The Notes and the Guarantees are secured by (i) first-priority security interests (subject to Permitted Liens)

in the Notes Priority Collateral and (ii) second-priority security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral. The
Notes Priority Collateral consists of substantially all of the property and assets, in each case, that are held by the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors, other than the ABL Priority Collateral and subject to the limitations described in
the next paragraph.

The Collateral does not include:

(1) all leasehold real property,

(2) all fee-owned real property with a fair market value (as reasonably estimated by the Company after
taking into account any liabilities with respect thereto that impact such fair market value) of less than
$15 million,

(3) interests in partnerships, joint ventures and non-wholly-owned subsidiaries which cannot be pledged
without (i) the consent of one or more third parties other than Holdings, the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the Uniform
Commercial Code or any other applicable laws) or (ii) giving rise to a “right of first refusal,” a “right of
first offer” or similar right that may be exercised by any third party other than Holdings, the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiares,

(4) the capital stock of Immaterial Subsidiaries (except to the extent the security interest therein can be
perfected by the filing of a Form UCC-1 (or similar) financing statement), captive insurance
subsidiaries, not-for-profit subsidiaries, special purpose entities used for permitted securitization
facilities and Unrestricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent the security interest therein can be
perfected by the filing of a Form UCC-1 (or similar) financing statement),

(5) margin stock,

(6) any property or asset the grant or perfection of a security interest in which would (i) require
governmental consent, approval, license or authorization unless such consent, approval, license or
authorization has been received, (ii) be prohibited by enforceable anti-assignment provisions of
applicable law, except to the extent such prohibition would be rendered ineffective under the UCC or
other applicable law notwithstanding such prohibition, or (iii) be prohibited by enforceable antiassignment provisions of contracts governing such asset in existence on the Issue Date (or on the date
of acquisition of the relevant asset (and in each case not entered into in anticipation of the Issue Date or
such acquisition and except, in each case, to the extent that term in such contract providing for such
prohibition purports to prohibit the granting of a security interest over all assets of such Guarantor or
the Issuer, as applicable)) other than to the extent such prohibition would be rendered ineffective under
the UCC or other applicable law,

(7) any “intent-to-use” trademark applications prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment
to Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the extent, if any, that, and solely during the period, if any, in
which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such intentto-use trademark application under applicable federal law,

(8) commercial tort claims with a value (as reasonably estimated by the Issuer) of less than $15 million,

(9) Tax and Trust Funds, and

(10) such other assets to the extent subject to exceptions and limitations set forth in the Indenture and the

Security Documents.

In addition to the provisions described below under “Intercreditor Agreements,” the security interests

securing the Notes and the Guarantees may also be subject to any other Permitted Liens.

157


-----

**Security Documents**

On the Issue Date the Company, the Guarantors and the Collateral Agent will enter into one or more

Security Documents defining the terms of the security interests that secure the Notes and the Guarantees. These
security interests secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Security Documents, as provided in the
Security Documents. As of the Issue Date, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association will act as Collateral Agent
on behalf of the Holders of Notes and the Trustee.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Company and the Guarantors will have the right to

remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than any property
constituting part of the Collateral and deposited with, or held by or on behalf of, the Pari Passu Agent in
accordance with the provisions of the Security Documents and other than as set forth in the Security Documents),
to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize value

from the collateral.”

**Intercreditor Agreements**

**_Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Holders of the Notes, the representatives of the holders of any

Additional Pari Passu Obligations (when and if any such representatives join the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement), the Term Loan Credit Agreement Agent, on behalf of the secured parties under the Term Loan
Credit Agreement will enter into the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue Date, which will be
acknowledged by the Issuer and the Guarantors party to the Term Loan Credit Agreement, and which Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement will set forth the relative rights and obligations of the holders of Pari Passu Obligations
with respect to Shared Collateral. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will be binding on the Holders of
Notes with respect to the matters described below to the same extent as such provisions apply to the Collateral
Agent. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide that in the event of a conflict or inconsistency
between the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and any Security Documents, the Indenture or the Notes, the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement shall be controlling as between the holders of Pari Passu Obligations thereunder.

The Notes, on the one hand, and the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, on the other hand,

are each referred to as a “series” of Pari Passu Obligations in this summary. The Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement may be amended without the consent of any Holder of a Note to add additional series of Pari Passu
Obligations incurred in accordance with the limitations in the Indenture.

This summary of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement also uses the following terms:

“Applicable Authorized Representative” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) until the earlier of

the discharge of Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Discharge of Term Loan Obligations”)
and the Non-Controlling Representative Enforcement Date, the Term Loan Credit Agreement Agent and (ii) from
and after earlier of the Discharge of the Term Loan Obligations and the Non-Controlling Representative
Enforcement Date, the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative.

“Authorized Representative” means, at any time, (i) in the case of any Obligations under the Term Loan

Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Credit Agreement Agent, (ii) in the case of the Notes, the Collateral Agent,
and (iii) in the case of any other series of Pari Passu Obligations that become subject to the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement, the collateral agent named as authorized representative for such series in the applicable
joinder agreement.

“Collateral” means all assets and properties subject to liens created pursuant to any Security Document to

secure one or more series of Pari Passu Obligations and shall include any property or assets subject to
replacement liens or adequate protection liens in favor of any applicable secured party.

158


-----

“Controlling Secured Parties” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, the secured parties with respect

to the series of Pari Passu Obligations whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized
Representative for such Shared Collateral.

“Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, the

Authorized Representative of the series of Pari Passu Obligations (other than the Obligations under the Term
Loan Credit Agreement) that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding series
of Pari Passu Obligations with respect to such Shared Collateral.

“Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” means, at any time with respect to any Shared Collateral, any

Authorized Representative that is not the Applicable Authorized Representative at such time with respect to such
Shared Collateral.

“Non-Controlling Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling

Authorized Representative, the date which is 180 days after the occurrence of both (i) an Event of Default (under
and as defined in the instrument in respect of which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the
Authorized Representative) and (ii) each Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such NonControlling Authorized Representative certifying that an Event of Default (under and as defined in the instrument
in respect of which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative) has
occurred and is continuing; provided that the Non-Controlling Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed
and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred (1) at any time that the Applicable Authorized
Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing an enforcement action with respect to all or a material
portion of the Shared Collateral or (2) as to the Issuer or any Guarantor, at any time the Issuer or such Guarantor
which has granted a security interest in the Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or
otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

“Shared Collateral” means, at any time, Collateral in which the holders of two or more series of Pari Passu

Obligations (or their respective Authorized Representatives) hold a valid and perfected security interest or Lien
at such time. If more than two series of Pari Passu Obligations are outstanding at any time and the holders of less
than all series of Pari Passu Obligations hold a valid and perfected security interest or Lien in any Collateral at
such time, then such Collateral shall constitute Shared Collateral for those series of Pari Passu Obligations that
hold a valid and perfected security interest in such Collateral at such time and shall not constitute Shared
Collateral for any series which does not have a valid and perfected security interest or Lien in such Collateral at
such time.

_Role of the Applicable Authorized Representative._ Pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement but

subject to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, with respect to any Shared Collateral:

(i) the Applicable Authorized Representative has the sole right to act or refrain from acting with respect to
the Shared Collateral;

(ii) the Applicable Authorized Representative is not under any duty to follow any instructions with respect

to the Shared Collateral from any other Pari Passu Agent or holders of Pari Passu Obligations other
than the Controlling Secured Parties in accordance with the applicable underlying controlling
agreements; and

(iii) no Pari Passu Agent or holders of Pari Passu Obligations other than the Controlling Secured Parties

may instruct the Applicable Authorized Representative to, and no Authorized Representative except the
Applicable Authorized Representative shall, commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure
proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for
or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to,
or otherwise take any action to enforce its interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available
to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral.

159


-----

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens securing each series of Pari Passu Obligations on any Shared

Collateral, the Applicable Authorized Representative may deal with the Collateral as if the Applicable
Authorized Representative had a senior and exclusive Lien on such Shared Collateral. No Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative or the holders of Pari Passu Obligations (other than the Controlling Secured Parties)
may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Authorized
Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Applicable Authorized
Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, in
each case, performed in accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Each Pari Passu
Agent party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will not (and waives any right to) contest or support any
other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the
perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the secured
parties with respect to any series of Pari Passu Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral subject to the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, each secured party with respect to any series of Pari Passu Obligations (i) will not take or cause

to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere with, hinder or delay, in any
manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared
Collateral by the Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) will not institute any suit or assert in any suit,
bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Applicable Authorized Representative or any
other secured party with respect to any series of Pari Passu Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by
way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral, (iii) will not seek,
and waives any right to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other
disposition of such Shared Collateral and (iv) will not attempt, directly or indirectly, whether by judicial
proceedings or otherwise, to challenge the enforceability of any provision of the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Distribution of Enforcement Proceeds._ If an Event of Default (under and as defined in an instrument

governing any series of Pari Passu Obligations) has occurred and is continuing and the Applicable Authorized
Representative or any holder of Pari Passu Obligations is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared
Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Shared Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding of any grantor of Collateral or otherwise, or any holder of Pari Passu Obligations receives any
payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement but including
the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or
other liquidation or disposition of any such Shared Collateral received by the Applicable Authorized
Representative or any holder of Pari Passu Obligations pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement or otherwise
with respect to such Shared Collateral and the proceeds of any such distribution, shall be applied as follows,
subject to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) first, to the payment in full in cash of all amounts owing to the Pari Passu Agents (in their capacity as
such) pursuant to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and any instrument pursuant to
which a series of Pari Passu Obligations is incurred; and

(ii) second, subject to certain limited exceptions, to the payment in full of the Pari Passu Obligations of

each series on a ratable basis in accordance with the terms of the applicable instrument pursuant to
which such Pari Passu Obligations have been incurred; and

(iii) third, after the payment in full in cash of all Pari Passu Obligations secured by a lien on such Shared

Collateral, to the relevant grantor or its successor or assigns or to whomever may be lawfully entitled
thereto or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of (x) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction

with respect to the Pari Passu Obligations of any series that (i) any of the Pari Passu Obligations of such series
are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another series of

160


-----

Pari Passu Obligations), (ii) any of the Pari Passu Obligations of such series do not have an enforceable security
interest in any of the Collateral securing any other series of Pari Passu Obligations and/or (iii) any intervening
security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than any other series of Pari Passu Obligations) on a
basis ranking prior to the security interest of such series of Pari Passu Obligations but junior to the security
interest of any other series of Pari Passu Obligations or (y) the existence of any Collateral for any other series of
Pari Passu Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such series of Pari Passu Obligations (any such condition
referred to in the foregoing clauses (x) or (y) with respect to any series of Pari Passu Obligations, an
“Impairment” of such series of Pari Passu Obligations), the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by
the holders of such series of Pari Passu Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series of Pari Passu
Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such series of Pari Passu
Obligations) set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that
the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of such series of Pari Passu Obligations subject to
such Impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party
(other than a holder of Pari Passu Obligations) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the
security interest of any series of Pari Passu Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal
proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of the holder of any other series of Pari Passu
Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Collateral or proceeds which are
allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted solely from the Collateral or proceeds to be distributed
in respect of the series Pari Passu Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists.

_Turnover._ If any holder of Pari Passu Obligations obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes

any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any Security Document or by the
exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or
through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to
the discharge of the Pari Passu Obligations, then such party shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or
payment in trust for the other holders of Pari Passu Obligations and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral,
proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Applicable Authorized Representative, to be distributed in
accordance with the provisions described in “—Distribution of Enforcement Proceeds” above.

_Automatic Release of Liens._ If, at any time, the Applicable Authorized Representative forecloses upon or

otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then
(whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each Pari
Passu Agent for the benefit of the secured parties of the applicable series will automatically be released and
discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied as described
in “—Distribution of Enforcement Proceeds” above.

**_ABL Intercreditor Agreement_**

The ABL Agent, the Term Loan Credit Agreement Agent and the Collateral Agent will enter into the ABL

Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue Date. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will be binding on the Holders of
the Notes. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement may be amended without the consent of any holder of Notes to add
additional Authorized Representatives that are parties to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement as
representatives for the holders of Pari Passu Obligations. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that in
the event of a conflict between the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and any other Intercreditor Agreement, the
ABL Intercreditor Agreement shall be controlling as between the holders of ABL Obligations and Pari Passu
Obligations thereunder until its termination. The “Designated Term Representative” will represent each of the
Holders of the Notes, the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the holders of any other Pari Passu
Obligations for certain purposes under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, and the identity of such “Designated
Term Representative” from time to time will be the representative designated as the “Applicable Authorized
Representative” under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

161


-----

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things:

_Lien Priority._ Notwithstanding the time, order or method of creation or perfection of any liens securing

the ABL Obligations and any Liens securing the Notes or any other Pari Passu Obligations, (i) the Liens on the
ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Obligations rank senior to any Liens securing the Notes or any other
Pari Passu Obligations on the ABL Priority Collateral and (ii) the Liens securing the Notes or any other Pari
Passu Obligations on the Notes Priority Collateral will rank senior to any Liens securing the ABL Obligations on
the Notes Priority Collateral.

_Prohibition on Contesting Liens and Obligations._ No holder of any Note or other Pari Passu Obligations

may contest the validity or enforceability of the Liens securing the ABL Obligations, and no holder of any ABL
Obligations may contest the validity or enforceability of the Liens securing the Notes or any other Pari Passu
Obligations.

_Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens._ The ABL Agent will have the sole power to exercise remedies

against the ABL Priority Collateral (subject to the right of the Pari Passu Agents and the Holders of Notes and
other Pari Passu Obligations to take limited protective measures with respect to the Liens securing the Notes and
other Pari Passu Obligations and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured
creditors not otherwise in contravention of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose
of the ABL Priority Collateral. The Designated Term Representative will have the sole power to exercise
remedies against the Notes Priority Collateral (subject to the right of the ABL Agent and the holders of ABL
Obligations to take limited protective measures and certain actions permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors
not otherwise in contravention of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the
Notes Priority Collateral.

Upon (x) any disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral to a Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the ABL

Obligations but does not guarantee the Notes or other Pari Passu Obligations, so long as such disposition is not
prohibited under the Indenture, the Term Loan Credit Agreement or any other agreement governing the Pari
Passu Obligations or (y) any disposition of ABL Priority Collateral that is either (i) not prohibited by the
Indenture, the Term Loan Credit Agreement or any other agreement governing any other Pari Passu Obligations
or (ii) occurs in connection with the foreclosure of or other exercise of remedies with respect to ABL Priority
Collateral by the ABL Agent, in each case, which results in the release of the Liens securing the ABL
Obligations on such item of ABL Priority Collateral, the Liens securing the Notes and the other Pari Passu
Obligations on such item of ABL Priority Collateral will be automatically released. Upon any disposition of any
Notes Priority Collateral that is either (i) not prohibited under the documents governing the ABL Obligations or
(ii) occurs in connection with the foreclosure of or other exercise of remedies with respect to the Notes Priority
Collateral by the Designated Term Representative, in each case, which results in the release of the Liens securing
the Pari Passu Obligations on such item of Notes Priority Collateral, the Liens securing the ABL Obligations on
such item of Notes Priority Collateral will be automatically released.

_ABL Agent’s Access and Use Rights._ Each Pari Passu Agent will permit the ABL Agent to have access to

and use of certain items of Notes Priority Collateral prior to, and for a period of up to 180 days (subject to
extension during periods when the ABL Agent is prohibited by law from exercising such rights) following, the
foreclosure upon or taking possession of such item of Notes Priority Collateral by the applicable Pari Passu
Agent in order to facilitate the ABL Agent’s exercise of remedies with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral.

_Tracing of Collateral and Treatment of Cash._ Prior to the provision of a notice of default by the ABL Agent

or a Pari Passu Agent to the other agent or an insolvency or liquidation proceeding (i) the ABL Agent will be
authorized to apply all funds deposited under account control agreements to the repayment of the ABL Obligations
in accordance with the ABL Credit Agreement and (ii) whether any asset was acquired by any Grantor with
“proceeds” (within the meaning of the UCC and whether or not deposited under account control agreements) of
ABL Priority Collateral or Notes Priority Collateral will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether such
acquired asset thereafter constitutes ABL Priority Collateral or Notes Priority Collateral.

162


-----

_Application of Proceeds and Turnover Provisions._ In connection with any enforcement action with respect

to the Collateral or any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, all proceeds of (x) ABL Priority Collateral will first
be applied to the repayment of all ABL Obligations before being applied to any obligations under the Notes or
any other Pari Passu Obligations and (y) Notes Priority Collateral will first be applied to the repayment of all
obligations under the Notes and any other Pari Passu Obligations before being applied to any ABL Obligations.
If any holder of a Note, other Pari Passu Obligation or ABL Obligation receives any proceeds of Collateral in
contravention of the foregoing, such proceeds will be turned over to the Designated Term Representative or ABL
Agent, as applicable, for application in accordance with the foregoing.

**Certain Matters in Connection with Liquidation and Insolvency Proceedings.**

_Debtor-in-Possession Financings._ In connection with any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of an

Issuer or any Guarantor, the ABL Agent may consent to certain debtor-in-possession financings secured by a
Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral ranking prior to the Liens securing the Notes and other Pari Passu
Obligations on such ABL Priority Collateral and junior to the Liens securing the Notes and other Pari Passu
Obligations on the Notes Priority Collateral securing the Notes and other Pari Passu Obligations, or to the use of
cash collateral constituting proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral without the consent of any holder of Notes or
other Pari Passu Obligations, and no holder of a Note or other Pari Passu Obligations shall be entitled to object to
(and will be deemed to have consented to) such use of cash collateral or debtor-in-possession financing, and no
Holder of a Note or other Pari Passu Obligations may seek “adequate protection” in connection therewith (other
than in the form of a lien on any additional items of collateral for the ABL Obligations which are granted in
connection with such debtor-in-possession financing or use of cash collateral with the same relative priority as
the other Liens on the Collateral governed by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement).

_Relief from Automatic Stay; Bankruptcy Sales and Post-Petition Interest._ No holder of a Note or any other

First Lien Obligation may (x) seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to any ABL Priority Collateral
without the consent of the ABL Agent, (y) object to any sale of any ABL Priority Collateral or any motion
seeking relief from the automatic stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, in each case which has been
supported by the holders of ABL Obligations or (z) object to any claim of any holder of ABL Obligations to
post-petition interest to the extent of its Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral. No holder of any ABL Obligation
may (x) seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to any Notes Priority Collateral without the consent of
the Designated Term Representative, (y) object to any sale of any Notes Priority Collateral or any motion seeking
relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Notes Priority Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding, in each case, which is supported by the Holders of the Notes and other Pari Passu Obligations or
(z) object to any claim of any holder of Notes or other Pari Passu Obligations to post-petition interest to the
extent of its Lien on the Notes Priority Collateral.

_Adequate Protection._ No holder of a Note or any other Pari Passu Obligations may (i) except as expressly

provided above with regard to debtor-in-possession financings, seek adequate protection on account of its Lien
on the ABL Priority Collateral other than in the form of junior priority liens or (ii) object to any request by the
holders of ABL Obligations for adequate protection on account of the ABL Priority Collateral (other than with
respect to payments from proceeds of Notes Priority Collateral). No holder of any ABL Obligation may
(i) except as expressly provided above with regard to debtor-in-possession financings, seek adequate protection
on account of its Lien on the Notes Priority Collateral other than in the form of junior priority liens or (ii) object
to any request by the Holders of Notes or other Pari Passu Obligations for adequate protection on account of the
Notes Priority Collateral (other than with respect to payments from the proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral).

_Plans of Reorganization._ Neither the ABL Agent, the Collateral Agent nor any holder of any ABL

Obligations, Notes or other Pari Passu Obligations may support any plan of reorganization in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding which contravenes the intercreditor provisions described above (unless consented to by
the ABL Agent or each Pari Passu Agent, as applicable, representing the holders of the Liens entitled to the
benefit of such contravened intercreditor provisions).

163


-----

**Release of Collateral**

In addition to releases pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements, subject to the terms of the Indenture and the

Security Documents the Issuer and the Guarantors are entitled to the releases of property and other assets
included in the Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes and the Guarantees under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) to enable us to consummate the disposition of such property or assets to the extent not prohibited under
the covenant described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes, the release of
the property and assets of such Guarantor; or

(3) as described under “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

The first-priority security interests in all Collateral securing the Notes or the Guarantees also will be

released upon (i) payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and
all other Obligations under the Indenture, under the Guarantees and under the Security Documents that are noncontingent and due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest,
are paid (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as described below under
“Satisfaction and Discharge”) or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as described
below under “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes will

be the Trustee.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar for the Notes. The initial registrar will be the Trustee. The registrar

will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and will facilitate
transfers of Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuer or

any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee

may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer
of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or
exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for
a period of 15 days before the sending of a notice of redemption.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will initially issue $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Issuer may issue

additional Notes under the Indenture from time to time after this offering subject to compliance with the
covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (the “Additional Notes”). The Notes offered hereby and any Additional
Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase provided that if any Additional
Notes are not fungible with the original notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional Notes will
have a separate CUSIP or ISIN number. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all
purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of Notes” include any Additional Notes.

164


-----

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and be payable in cash. Interest on the Notes

will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each and, commencing on, 2016. The

Issuer will make each interest payment to the Holders of record of the Notes at the close of business on the
immediately preceding and . Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which

interest has been paid with respect to such Notes, or if no interest has been paid with respect to such Notes, from
the date of original issuance thereof. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of
twelve 30-day months. The Notes will mature on, 2022 (a date that will be approximately six and

one half years after the Issue Date) and will be issued in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess of $2,000.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the Issuer

maintained for such purpose or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made through the paying
agent by check mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided
that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more
global notes registered in the name of or held by The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee will be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the

Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described
under the caption “Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” The Company or its Affiliates may at any time and
from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem Notes at its option prior to,

2019.

At any time prior to, 2019, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Notes, at its option, at any

time or from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice mailed by first class mail to
the registered address of each Holder of Notes or otherwise delivered in accordance with the procedures of DTC,
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium
as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption (the “Redemption
_Date”), subject to the rights of Holders of record at the close of business on the relevant record date to receive_
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date.

On and after, 2019, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part

from time to time, upon notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at the redemption prices
(expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of
Holders of record at the close of business on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period
beginning on of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %

In addition, until, 2019, the Issuer may, at its option, on one or more occasions redeem up to 40%

of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes) at a
redemption price equal to % of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest

165


-----

thereon, if any, to, but not including, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record at
the close of business on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date
falling prior to or on the Redemption Date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided
that at least 50% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued under the Indenture and
any Additional Notes remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption; provided
_further that each such redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering_
upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice sent to each Holder of Notes being redeemed and otherwise
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of

Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer or any third
party making a such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 15 nor more than
60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 15 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such
tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon, to, but not including, the date of such redemption.

Notice of any redemption of Notes described above may be given prior to such redemption, and any such

redemption or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including,
but not limited to, completion of the relevant Equity Offering, other offering or other transaction or event. In
addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall
describe each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Redemption Date
may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed
or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by
the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event
that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Redemption Date, or by the Redemption Date
as so delayed. The Issuer will provide prompt written notice to the Trustee rescinding such redemption in the
event that any such condition precedent shall not have occurred, and such redemption and notice of redemption
shall be rescinded and of no force or effect. Upon receipt of such notice from the Issuer rescinding such
redemption, the Trustee will promptly send a copy of such notice to the Holders of the Notes to be redeemed in
the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given.

The Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice.”

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that, if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date, unless the Issuer has

previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under
“Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described
below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of
the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes at the close of business on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date. Within 30
days following any Change of Control occurring after the Issue Date, the Issuer will send notice of such Change
of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the registered address
of such Holder or otherwise electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following
information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Repurchase at the

Option of Holders—Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control

166


-----

Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase, subject to the right
of Holders of record of the Notes at the close of business on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days

from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered, subject to extension (in the case where such notice is
mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control as described below) in the event
that the occurrence of the Change of Control is delayed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for

payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment
Date;

(5) if such written notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of

Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and shall describe each such condition,
and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed
until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic
transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that such redemption may not occur and such
notice may be rescinded or amended in the event that the Company shall determine that the Change of Control
will not occur by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed;

(6) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be

required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of
such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the
close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(7) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to

purchase such Notes, provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second
Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, an electronic transmission (PDF), facsimile
transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes with proof of ownership, the principal
amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and
its election to have such Notes purchased; and

(8) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that

a Holder must follow.

Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued

but not outstanding or will be retired and cancelled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party
pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other

securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase by the Issuer of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in
the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On or before, as applicable, the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by

law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of

Control Offer;

167


-----

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of

all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an

Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Credit Facilities will prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which

the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of
Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the
Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such
borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to
purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under
the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.

The Senior Credit Facilities will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to senior

indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect
to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we
experience a change of control event that triggers a default thereunder, we could seek a waiver of such default or
seek to refinance such Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance such Indebtedness,
such default could result in amounts outstanding under such Indebtedness being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be

limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary
to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to
repurchase the notes upon a change of control.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or

discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of
Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. After the Issue Date, we
have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we
could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such
time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such
restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will
not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party

makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon
such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of
the Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the

Company to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”

168


-----

under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may
require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the

Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. A Change of Control Offer may be made at
the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the
Notes and/or the Guarantees.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries

to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by

way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in
connection with such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Company (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration received therefor by the

Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the
amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance

sheet or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such
liabilities that would have been reflected on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or
in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance
sheet, as determined in good faith by the Company) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, other
than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantees, that are assumed by the
transferee of any such assets or that are otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction
with such transferee and for which the Company and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly
released by all creditors in writing,

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Company or such Restricted

Subsidiary from such transferee (including earnouts or similar obligations) that are converted by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied
for Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received) within 180 days following the closing
of such Asset Sale,

(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of

such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any
guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with the Asset Sale, and

(d) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in

such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash
Consideration received pursuant to this clause (d) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater
of (x) $75.0 million and (y) 1.5% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated
Non-cash Consideration (or, at the Company’s option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset
Sale), with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the
time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be Cash
Equivalents for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.

169


-----

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale of Collateral (such Net Proceeds,

“Collateral Net Proceeds”), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net
Proceeds from such Asset Sale,

(1) to repay:

(a) Indebtedness constituting Pari Passu Obligations (other than the Notes) under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), provided that, if the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall so reduce any such Pari Passu Obligations, the Company will equally
and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under “Optional Redemption,”
through open-market purchases (provided that such purchases are at or above 100.0% of the
principal amount thereof or, if less, the accreted value thereof) or by making an offer whether or
not accepted (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for a Collateral Asset Sale Offer)
to all Holders to purchase their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount
thereof or, if less, the accreted value thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the
principal amount of Notes so purchased, or

(b) to the extent such Net Proceeds constitute proceeds from ABL Priority Collateral, Indebtedness
under the ABL Credit Agreement (and to effect a corresponding reduction in commitments under
the ABL Credit Agreement);

_provided, that in the case of clause (a) above, (i) if an offer to purchase any Indebtedness constituting Pari Passu_
Obligations under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement is made, such amount will be deemed repaid to the
extent of the amount of such offer, whether or not accepted by the holders of such Indebtedness, and no
Collateral Net Proceeds in the amount of such offer will be deemed to exist following such offer, and (ii) if the
holder of any Indebtedness constituting Pari Passu Obligations under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement
declines the repayment of such Indebtedness constituting Pari Passu Obligations under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement owed to it from such Collateral Net Proceeds, such amount will be deemed repaid to the
extent of the declined Collateral Net Proceeds;

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any
business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business
such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other
properties or assets, in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business;

(3) to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any
business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business
such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) other assets that, in the case of each
of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or other assets that are the subject of such
Asset Sale; or

(4) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, a binding commitment entered into not later than such_
365th day shall extend the period for such Investment or other payment for an additional 180 days after the end
of such 365-day period so long as the Company or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment
with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180
days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later
cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within such
180-day period; provided, further, that (x) if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any
reason before such Net Proceeds are applied or (y) such Net Proceeds are not actually so invested or paid in

170


-----

accordance with clause (2) above by the end of such 180-day period, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute
Excess Proceeds on the date of such cancellation or termination, or such 180th day, as applicable.

Any Collateral Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale of Collateral that are not invested or applied as provided

and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Collateral Excess
_Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds exceeds $40.0 million, the Company shall_
make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Obligations under the
Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, to the holders of such other Pari Passu Obligations (a “Collateral Asset Sale
_Offer”) to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations_
that is in an amount equal to at least $2,000, that may be purchased out of the Collateral Excess Proceeds at an
offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if
less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Company will commence a Collateral Asset Sale Offer with respect
to Collateral Excess Proceeds within thirty Business Days after the date that Collateral Excess Proceeds exceed
$40.0 million by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee.
The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Collateral Net Proceeds from a Collateral
Asset Sale by making a Collateral Asset Sale Offer (an “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a portion of any
Collateral Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) prior to the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer
period provided above) or with respect to Collateral Excess Proceeds of $40.0 million or less.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations tendered pursuant to

a Collateral Asset Sale Offer is less than the Collateral Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the
Advance Portion), the Company shall be deemed to have complied with its obligations under the Indenture and
may retain any remaining Collateral Excess Proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate
principal amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations tendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount
of Collateral Excess Proceeds, the Trustee, subject to DTC customary procedures, shall select the Notes and the
Company shall select the other Pari Passu Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted
value or principal amount of the Notes or such other Pari Passu Obligations tendered with adjustments as
necessary so that no Notes or other Pari Passu Obligations will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized
denomination. Upon completion of any such Collateral Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Collateral Excess
Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any
remaining Collateral Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Collateral Excess Proceeds and the Company may use
such Collateral Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale of non-Collateral, the Company or

such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale,

(1) to repay:

(a) Obligations under any Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) of the Company or any

Restricted Subsidiary (and if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit indebtedness, to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto), provided that the Company shall equally and ratably reduce
Obligations under the Notes as provided under “Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to
the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof or, if less, the accreted value
thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to
all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof or, if less, the accreted value
thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise
be prepaid; or

(b) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the

Company or another Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, that in the case of clause (a) above, (i) if an offer to purchase any Indebtedness of the Company or any_
Restricted Subsidiary is made, such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the amount of such offer,

171


-----

whether or not accepted by the holders of such Indebtedness, and no Net Proceeds in the amount of such offer
will be deemed to exist following such offer, and (ii) if the holder of any Indebtedness of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary declines the repayment of such Indebtedness owed to it from such Net Proceeds, such
amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the declined Net Proceeds;

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business

is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted
Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other properties or assets, in the case of each of (a),
(b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business;

(3) to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business

is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted
Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) other assets that, in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses,
properties and/or other assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or

(4) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted_
application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company or such other
Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be
applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in
the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are
applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable
Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (or, if later, 365 days
after the receipt of such Net Proceeds); provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess
Proceeds (as defined below).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sales by a

Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being
repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in
compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long,
but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company
hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to take all actions reasonably
required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such
repatriation), and if such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local
law, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Proceeds will be applied (whether or not
repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant.

Any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time

period set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Net Proceeds used to
make an offer to purchase Notes, as described in clause (1) above, will be deemed to have been invested whether
or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds $40.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders and, at the option of the
Company, to any holders of any Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”) (an
“Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness that is at least $2,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased
out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
or 100% of the accreted value thereof, if less, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, (or, in respect of such Pari
_Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Pari Passu_

172


-----

Indebtedness) to, but not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the Indenture. The Company will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds
within thirty Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $40.0 million by sending the notice
required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee, or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of DTC. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Net Proceeds by
making an Advance Offer with respect to the Advance Portion in advance of being required to do so by the
Indenture or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $40.0 million or less.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an

Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the
Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to compliance with
other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and the Pari Passu
Indebtedness surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select
the Notes to be purchased in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice” below. Selection of such Pari
_Passu Indebtedness will be made pursuant to the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness. Upon completion of any_
such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any
remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any
Advance Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use
such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

Pending the final application of any Collateral Net Proceeds or Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the

holder of such Collateral Net Proceeds or Net Proceeds may apply such Collateral Net Proceeds or Net Proceeds
temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such
Collateral net Proceeds or Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other

securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer or an Asset Sale Offer, as applicable. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have
breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The Senior Credit Facilities will prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which

the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this
Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could
seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that
contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain
prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would
constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such
other agreements.

**_Special Mandatory Offer to Purchase_**

Unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all outstanding

Notes as described under “Optional Redemption,” if a Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, each Holder
will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to at least $2,000 and an integral
multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder’s Notes pursuant to an offer (‘‘Triggering Event Repurchase
_Offer’’) for an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to_
the date of repurchase.

A “Triggering Event” will be deemed to occur on the date six months prior to the Stated Maturity of the

Existing Senior Notes, if on such date, any of the Existing Senior Notes shall remain outstanding.

173


-----

Within three Business Days following a Triggering Event, the Issuer shall electronically deliver or mail a

notice to each holder with a copy to the Trustee and the paying agent stating:

(1) that a Triggering Event has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase such holder’s Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of
holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date);

(2) the repurchase date (which shall be no later than 45 days from the date of the Triggering Event);

(3) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow in
order to have its Notes purchased; and

(4) if such notice is electronically delivered or mailed prior to the occurrence of a Triggering Event, that
such Triggering Event Repurchase Offer is conditioned on the occurrence of such Triggering Event.

For the avoidance of doubt, a Triggering Event Repurchase Offer may be made in advance of a Triggering

Event, and be conditional upon such Triggering Event.

Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Triggering Event Repurchase Offer will have the status of

Notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option of the Issuer.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other

securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer or an Asset Sale Offer, as applicable. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have
breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Notes issued by it at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes

to be redeemed by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC; provided that no Notes of $2,000, and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof, or less shall be redeemed in part.

Notices of purchase or redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not

more than 60 days before the date of purchase or Redemption Date to each Holder of record of Notes at such
Holder’s registered address or otherwise delivered in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that
redemption notices may be mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the procedures of DTC) more than
60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of
purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has
been or is to be purchased or redeemed.

The Issuer may issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Note called

for redemption or tendered for purchase in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the redeemed or
purchased Note (or if the Note is a Global Note, an adjustment shall be made to the schedule attached thereto),
subject to the terms of the Indenture. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption.
On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption,
unless the Issuer defaults in the delivery of the redemption amount.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

174


-----

**_Covenant Suspension_**

If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from both Rating

Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture then, beginning on that day and
continuing at all times thereafter until the Reversion Date, as defined below (the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”),
the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” (collectively, the
“Suspended Covenants” and each individually, a “Suspended Covenant”) will not be applicable to the Notes:

(1) “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All
Assets”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(7) “—Future Subsidiary Guarantors”; and

(8) “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

During a Suspension Period, the Company may not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted

Subsidiaries pursuant to the second sentence of the definition “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”

If and while the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the

Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of
the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) (a) one or both of the Rating Agencies
withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment
Grade Rating, then the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events and (b) the Company or any of its Affiliates enters
into an agreement to effect a transaction that would result in a Change of Control and one or more of the Rating
Agencies indicate that if consummated, such transaction (alone or together with any related recapitalization or
refinancing transactions) would cause such Rating Agency to withdraw its Investment Grade Rating or
downgrade the ratings assigned to the Notes below Investment Grade Rating, then the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenant referenced in clause (8) of the
immediately preceding paragraph under the Indenture with respect to future events, including without limitation,
the proposed transaction described in this clause (b). The period beginning on the day of a Covenant Suspension
Event and ending on a Reversion Date is called a “Suspension Period.”

On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during

the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence
of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Calculations made after the Reversion
Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
will be made as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect
prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred
on the Reversion Date (or thereafter) under any Suspended Covenant solely as a result of any actions taken by the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, or events occurring, during the Suspension Period. On and after each
Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions
contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period (and not in contemplation of the
Reversion Date) so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such
Suspension Period.

175


-----

For purposes of the “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date,

the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero.

For purposes of the “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”

covenant, on the Reversion Date, any contractual encumbrances or restrictions of the type specified in clause (1),
(2) or (3) of that covenant entered into during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been in effect on the
Issue Date, so that they are permitted under clause (a) under “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.”

For purposes of the “—Transactions with Affiliates” covenant, any Affiliate Transaction entered into after

the Reversion Date pursuant to a contract, agreement, loan, advance or guaranty with, or for the benefit of, any
Affiliate of the Company entered into during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been in effect as of
the Issue Date for purposes of clause (6) under “—Transactions with Affiliates.” Within 10 days following the
Reversion Date any Guarantees released solely upon the related Covenant Suspension Event shall be reinstated
and the Company must comply with the terms of the covenant under “—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.”

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate notifying it of the commencement or

termination of any Suspension Period. The Trustee shall have no independent obligation to determine if a
Suspension Period has commenced or terminated, to notify the Holders regarding the same or to determine the
consequences thereof.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or any distribution on account of the Company’s,

or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (in each case, solely in such Person’s capacity as holder of
such Equity Interests), including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger or
consolidation other than:

(a) dividends or distributions by the Company payable solely in Equity Interests (other than

Disqualified Stock) of the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company; or

(b) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or

distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary
other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata
share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of
securities;

(II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Company

or any direct or indirect parent of the Company, including in connection with any merger or consolidation, in
each case held by Persons other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value,

in each case prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness
of the Company or a Guarantor, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the covenant described under “—Limitation on

Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or

(b) the payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement for value of

Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal
installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such payment, redemption,
repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement; or

176


-----

(IV) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above being collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(1) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Company could incur $1.00

of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by

the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments made by the
next succeeding paragraph other than clauses (1) and (9) thereof), is less than the sum of (without duplication):

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period)

beginning on the first day of the fiscal quarter of the Issuer during which the Issue Date occurs to the end of
the Issuer’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the
time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit,
minus 100% of such deficit; plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by

the Company, of marketable securities or other property received by the Company since the Issue Date
(other than net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock”) from the issue or sale of:

(i) (A) Equity Interests of the Company, including Treasury Capital Stock (as defined below), but

excluding cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Company, of
marketable securities or other property received from the sale of:

(x) Equity Interests to any future, present or former employee, officer, director, member of

management or consultant (or the estate, heirs, family members, spouse, former spouse, domestic
partner or former domestic partner of any of the foregoing) of the Company, any direct or indirect
parent company of the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries since the Issue Date to the
extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause
(4) of the next succeeding paragraph; and

(y) Designated Preferred Stock; and

(B) to the extent such net cash proceeds or other property are actually contributed to the

Company, Equity Interests of the Company’s direct or indirect parent companies (excluding
contributions of the proceeds from the sale of Designated Preferred Stock of such companies or
contributions to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in
accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph); or

(ii) debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that has been converted into or exchanged

for Equity Interests of the Company or its direct or indirect parent companies; provided, however, that
this clause (b) shall not include the proceeds from (W) Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below),
(X) Equity Interests or convertible debt securities of the Company sold to a Restricted Subsidiary,
(Y) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock or
(Z) Excluded Contributions; plus

(c) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the

Company, of marketable securities or other property contributed to the capital of the Company following the

177

Issue Date other than (X) net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur
Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock,” (Y) by a Restricted Subsidiary and (Z) from any Excluded Contributions; plus

(d) 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the fair market value, as determined in good

faith by the Company, of marketable securities or other property received by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary by means of:

(i) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) of

Restricted Investments made by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, repurchases and
redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries,
repayments of loans or advances, releases of guarantees, which constitute Restricted Investments by the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, return of capital, income, profits and other amounts realized as
a return or Investment from any Restricted Investment by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries,
in each case since the Issue Date; or

(ii) the sale or other distribution (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the

Equity Interests of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other
than in each case to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the
extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment) or a dividend or distribution from an
Unrestricted Subsidiary since the Issue Date; plus

(e) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or the

merger, amalgamation or consolidation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary or the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date, the fair market value of the Investment of the
Company or the Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary (or the assets transferred), as
determined by the Company in good faith at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as
a Restricted Subsidiary or at the time of such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or transfer of assets other
than to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment; plus

(f) in the event the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company makes any Investment in a

Person that, as a result of or in connection with such Investment, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company, an amount equal to the fair market value of the existing Investment in such Person, to the extent
such existing Investment constituted a Restricted Investment or was made pursuant to this paragraph or the
next succeeding paragraph (other than clause (11) of the next succeeding paragraph) after the Issue Date;
_plus_

(g) $100.0 million.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption within

60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or other distribution or giving of the redemption notice, as
the case may be, if at the date of declaration or distribution such dividend, distribution or redemption payment
would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture (assuming, in the case of a redemption payment, the
giving of the notice would have been deemed a Restricted Payment at such time and such deemed Restricted
Payment would have been permitted at such time);

(2) (a) the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of any Equity Interests (“Treasury

_Capital Stock”) or Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company, any direct or indirect parent of the Company or_
any Restricted Subsidiary in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale or issuance
(other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of, Equity Interests of the Company or any direct or indirect parent

concurrent), (b) the declaration and payment of dividends on Treasury Capital Stock out of the proceeds of the
substantially concurrent sale or issuance (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of any Refunding Capital Stock
(with 120 days being deemed substantially concurrent) and (c) if immediately prior to the retirement of Treasury
Capital Stock, the declaration and payment of dividends thereon was permitted under clause (6) of this
paragraph, the declaration and payment of dividends on the Refunding Capital Stock (other than Refunding
Capital Stock the proceeds of which were used to redeem, repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire any Equity
Interests of any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer) in an aggregate amount per year no greater than
the aggregate amount of dividends per annum that were declarable and payable on such Treasury Capital Stock
immediately prior to such retirement;

(3) the principal payment on, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, exchange or other acquisition or

retirement of (x) Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor made by exchange for, or out of the

Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or (y) Disqualified Stock of the Company or a
Guarantor made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (with 120 days being
deemed substantially concurrent) of, Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Guarantor, that, in each case, is

required to be paid under the terms of the instrument governing the Subordinated Indebtedness or

than the final scheduled maturity date of the Subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock being so
repaid, repurchased, redeemed, defeased, exchanged, acquired or retired; and

(d) such new Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock has a Weighted Average Life to Maturity at the time

_provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment permitted under clauses_
(11), (16) and (18), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof.

In determining whether any Restricted Payment is permitted by this covenant, the Company and its

Restricted Subsidiaries may allocate all or any portion of such Restricted Payment among the categories
described in clauses (1) through (19) of the immediately preceding paragraph or among such categories and the
types of Restricted Payments described in the first paragraph of this covenant (including categorization in whole

183


-----

the time of such allocation, all such Restricted Payments, or allocated portions thereof, would be permitted under
the various provisions of this covenant and provided further that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may reclassify all or a portion of such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in any manner that complies
with this covenant (based on circumstances existing at the time of such reclassification), and following such
reclassification such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment shall be treated as having been made pursuant
to only the clause or clauses of this covenant to which such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment has been
reclassified.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair market value on the date the

Restricted Payment is made, or at the Issuer’s election, the date a commitment is made to make such Restricted
Payment, of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company will

not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the second to last
sentence of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except
to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Investments in an amount determined
as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a
Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant
to the first paragraph of this section or clause (7), (10), (11) or (18) of the second paragraph of this section or
pursuant to the definition of Permitted Investment and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth
in the Indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch up payment”

with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,

incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise
(collectively, “incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the
Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of
Disqualified Stock and issue shares of Preferred Stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries’ most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00, determined on a pro forma basis
(including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been
incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of
the proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; provided that the amount of
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or
issued, as applicable, pursuant to the foregoing by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors under this
paragraph shall not exceed at any one time outstanding, in the aggregate, (together with all Indebtedness incurred
under clause (18) below by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors) the greater of (x) $175.0 million and
(y) 4.5% of Consolidated Total Assets at any one time outstanding.

$250.0 million and the Borrowing Base as of the date of such incurrence plus (B) the sum of (i) $1,400.0 million
and (ii) an unlimited additional amount of Indebtedness after all amounts have been incurred under clauses

the incurrence or issuance of such Indebtedness, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance and
the application of the proceeds thereof, is either (x) less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.00 or, to the extent such
Indebtedness constitutes Junior Lien Obligations, so long as the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio is less than or
equal to 4.70 to 1.00 or (y) in each case, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such incurrence and related
transaction, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, as applicable
does not increase as a result of such transaction provided that in the case of clause (y) such Indebtedness was
incurred for the purpose of funding an acquisition, provided that any Indebtedness incurred under this clause

secured, solely for purposes of calculating the Consolidated First Lien Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated
Secured Debt Ratio, as applicable, for this clause (1);

to refund, refinance or replace any other Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued
pursuant to this clause (4); provided that the aggregate amount of Indebtedness incurred and Disqualified Stock

Capital Stock or any other event which results in any Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary
or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Company or another Restricted
Subsidiary or any pledge of such Indebtedness constituting a Permitted Lien) shall be deemed, in each case, to be

(22) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as an account party in respect of trade letters

of credit issued in the ordinary course of business;

(23) Indebtedness consisting of obligations owing under dealer incentive, supply, license or similar

agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(24) Indebtedness representing deferred compensation to directors, officers, employees, members of

management, managers or consultants of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any direct or
indirect parent company incurred in the ordinary course of business and deferred compensation or other similar
arrangements in connection with the Transactions or in connection with any Investments or any Restricted
Payments permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(25) Indebtedness in an aggregate principal or face amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $30.0

million in respect of letters of credit, bank guaranties, surety bonds, performance bonds and similar instruments
issued for general corporate purposes and denominated in currencies other than dollars, euros or pounds sterling;

(26) Indebtedness arising in respect of Sale and Lease-Back Transactions not to exceed the greater of $120.0

(28) Indebtedness in respect of the Specified Property Financing; and

(29) Indebtedness of the Company and/or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred in connection with (a) a

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness,

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the
categories of permitted Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through
(29) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole
discretion, will classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant;
_provided that all Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities on the Issue Date shall be treated as_
incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the preceding paragraph.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original

issue discount, and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the same class, accretion or amortization of original issue
discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an
issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Guarantees of, or obligations in

189


-----

respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a
particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness;
_provided that the incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may_
be, was in compliance with this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of

Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar
equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long
as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness (plus premium (including tender premiums), fees,
defeasance costs, accrued interest and expenses including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different

currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate
applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

In the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a

revolving credit facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Company’s option as
elected on the date the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, enters into or increases such
commitments, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such increase in
commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, test is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this
covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or
creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed, but undrawn amount permitted to
be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date
pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for
purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total
Leverage Ratio, as applicable) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such
facility or increased commitment.

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to,

directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually
subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as
the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such
Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee within 90 days of the incurrence of such Indebtedness to the extent and in the
same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary
Guarantor, as the case may be.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness

merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior
indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral.

190

**_Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,

assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness or
any related guarantee, on any asset or property of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any income or
profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom.

The expansion of Liens by virtue of accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of

interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, amortization of original issue discount and increases
in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or
increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Liens for
purposes of this covenant.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

The Company may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Company is

the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
its properties or assets on a consolidated basis, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or

merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or
existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (the Company or such
Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”);

(2) the Successor Company, if other than the Company, expressly assumes all the obligations of the

Company under the Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents pursuant to a supplemental indenture or
other document or instrument;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing transactions, as if

such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness

pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock,” or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would

be equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, in which case clause

(1)(b) of the second succeeding paragraph shall apply, shall have by supplemental indenture and other documents
or instruments confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations under the Indenture, the
Notes and the Security Documents; and

(6) the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of

Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any,
comply with the Indenture; provided that in giving such Opinion of Counsel, such counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (3) and (4) and as to any other matters of fact.

The Successor Company (if other than the Company) will succeed to, and be substituted for the Company,

as the case may be, under the Indenture and the Notes and in such event the Company will automatically be
released and discharged from its obligation under the Indenture and the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the following transactions),

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with or merge with or into or wind up into or sell, assign,

transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or any other
Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) the Company may consolidate with or merge with or into or wind up into an Affiliate of the Company

solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company in a state of the United States, the District of Columbia or
any territory thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not
increased thereby; and

(3) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be converted into, or reorganized or reconstituted as a

limited liability company, limited partnership or corporation in a state of the United States, the District of
Columbia or any territory thereof.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing the release of a Guarantee upon the sale,

disposition or transfer of a Subsidiary Guarantor, no Subsidiary Guarantor will, and the Company will not permit
any Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Company or a
Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of
all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person (other than any
such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition in connection with the Transactions described in
this offering circular) unless:

(1) (a) such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such

consolidation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability
company organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as
the case may be, or the laws of under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or
any territory thereof (such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
“Successor Person”);

(b) the Successor Person, if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor, expressly assumes all the obligations

of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s related Guarantee and
the Security Documents pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments;

(c) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists; and

(d) the Successor Person shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of

Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any,
comply with the Indenture; provided that in giving such Opinion of Counsel, such counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate or as to compliance with the foregoing clause (c); or

(2) the transaction is made in compliance with clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of the covenant

described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person (if other than such Subsidiary

Guarantor) will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture, such
Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee and the Security Documents, and such Subsidiary Guarantor will
automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and such Subsidiary

Guarantor’s Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with or
merge with or into or wind up into or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its
properties and assets to another Subsidiary Guarantor or to the Company, (2) a Subsidiary Guarantor may
consolidate or merge with or into or wind up or convert into an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of
reincorporating such Subsidiary Guarantor in another state of the United States or the District of Columbia so
long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor is not increased thereby, or (3) a Subsidiary
Guarantor may convert into a Person organized or existing under the laws of a jurisdiction in the United States.

Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of All or Substantially

All Assets” covenant will not apply to a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets
between or among the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” under New York law,

which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or

sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets
from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or
guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate
_Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $15.0 million, unless:_

(1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms, taken as a whole, that are not materially less favorable to the

Company or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable
transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis, or
if in the good faith judgment of the board of directors, no comparable transaction is available with which to
compare the Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise fair to the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial point of view; and

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related

Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $30.0 million, a resolution
adopted by the majority of the board of directors of the Company approving such Affiliate Transaction and set
forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction, and any merger, consolidation or amalgamation

(or a parent company thereof) and such merger, consolidation or amalgamation is otherwise in compliance with
the terms of the Indenture and effected for a bona fide business purpose;

(2) Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the covenant

disadvantageous in any material respect, in the good faith judgment of the Company, to the Holders when taken
as a whole as compared to the Sponsor Management Agreements in effect on the Issue Date (it being understood
that any amendment thereto or replacement thereof to increase any fees or other compensation payable or
implement new fees or compensation payable pursuant to such Sponsor Management Agreements would be
deemed to be materially disadvantageous to the Holders) and (ii) the payment of all indemnities and expenses

domestic partner or former domestic partner of any of the foregoing) of the Company, any of its direct or indirect
parent companies or any of its subsidiaries;

the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are not materially less
favorable to the Company or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’slength basis;

(6) any agreement as in effect as of the Issue Date, or any amendment, modification or extension thereof (so

in each case, any amendment thereto or similar transactions, agreements or arrangements which it may enter into
thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries of obligations under, any future amendment to any such existing transaction, agreement or
arrangement or any similar transaction, agreement or arrangement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be
permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms of any such existing transaction, agreement or
arrangement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, or new transaction, agreement or
arrangement are not otherwise disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders when taken as a whole as
compared to the original agreement in effect on the Issue Date as determined in good faith by the Company;

(8) (a) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, joint ventures, contractors, or purchasers or sellers of

goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, or transactions otherwise relating to the purchase or
sale of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the
terms of the Indenture which are fair to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the good faith

of such Subsidiary;

(t) restrictions contained in any agreement with respect to any IRB Transaction; and

(u) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above imposed by

any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (t) above;
_provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,_
replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Company, no more restrictive in any
material respect with respect to such encumbrances and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior
to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or
refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred Stock in

receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on
common stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (2) the
subordination of loans or advances made to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness
incurred by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to
make loans or advances.

**_Future Subsidiary Guarantors_**

The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to guarantee or incur any Indebtedness

under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are
Domestic Subsidiaries to guarantee or incur any Indebtedness under any other syndicated bank or capital markets
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $50
million, unless such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary
will Guarantee payment of the Notes on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture and the
Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each such Guarantee may be limited as necessary to recognize certain
defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Each Person that becomes a Guarantor after the Issue Date shall also become a party to the applicable

Security Documents pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and shall as promptly as practicable, and in no event
later than 90 days, execute and deliver such security instruments, financing statements, mortgages, deeds of trust
(in substantially the same form as those executed and delivered with respect to the Collateral on the Issue Date or
on the date first delivered in the case of Collateral that the Indenture provides may be delivered after the Issue
Date (to the extent, and substantially in the form, delivered on the Issue Date or the date first delivered, as
applicable (but no greater scope)) as may be necessary to vest in the Collateral Agent a perfected first-priority
security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in properties and assets that constitute Notes Priority Collateral and
a perfected second-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in properties and assets that constitute

198


-----

ABL Priority Collateral, as security for such Guarantor’s Guarantee and as may be necessary to have such
property or asset added to the Collateral as required under the Security Documents and the Indenture, and
thereupon all provisions of the Indenture relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such properties
and assets to the same extent and with the same force and effect.

Each Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under “—

Guarantees.”

**_Reports and Other Information_**

Whether or not the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange

Act, so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Holders and the Trustee:

(1) (x) all annual and quarterly financial statements that would be required to be contained in a filing with

the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q of the Company, if the Company were required to file such forms, plus a
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”; (y) with respect to
the annual and quarterly information, a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA of the Company (the foregoing
financial information to be prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP
financial measures included in this offering circular); and (z) with respect to the annual financial statements only,
a report on the annual financial statements by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm; it
being understood that the Company shall not be required to include, except as otherwise provided in this
paragraph (1), any other adjustment that would be required by any SEC rule, regulation or interpretation,
including but not limited to any “push down” accounting adjustment; and

(2) within five Business Days after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other

information containing substantially the same information that would be required to be contained in filings with
the SEC on Form 8-K under Items 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01, 2.06, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01 and 5.02(b) with respect to
executive officers and (c)(1) (other than with respect to information otherwise required or contemplated by
Item 402 of Regulation S-K) (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, financial statements and exhibits that
would be required pursuant to Item 9.01 of Form 8-K, other than financial statements and pro forma financial
information required pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) of Item 9.01 of Form 8-K (in each case relating to
transactions required to be reported pursuant to Item 2.01 of Form 8-K) to the extent available (as determined by
the Issuer in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive)) if the Issuer had been a reporting company
under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that no such current report will be required to be furnished if the
Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such event is not material to Holders or the business, assets,
operations, financial position or prospects of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and the
Issuer may omit from such disclosure any terms of such event if the Issuer determines in its good faith judgment
that disclosure of such terms would otherwise cause material competitive harm to the business, assets, operations,
financial position or prospects of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, that such
non-disclosure shall be limited only to those specific provisions that would cause material competitive harm and
not the occurrence of the event itself provided, further, that no such current report will be required to include a
summary of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement agreement, plan or understanding
between the Issuer (or any of its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or executive officer, of the Issuer (or
any of its Subsidiaries).

All such annual reports shall be furnished within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate,

and all such quarterly reports shall be furnished within 45 days after the end of the fiscal quarter to which they
relate; provided that the annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 shall be furnished within 120
days after the end of the fiscal year to which it relates and the quarterly report for the first two quarters ending
after the Issue Date shall be furnished within 60 days after the end of the fiscal quarter to which it relates.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Company will not be required to furnish any information, certificates

or reports required by (i) Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related

199


-----

Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K, (ii) Regulation G or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC
with respect to any non-generally accepted accounting principles financial measures contained therein,
(iii) segment accounting rules or (iv) Rule 3-05, 3-09 and 3-10 of Regulation S-X, (b) such reports shall not be
required to present compensation or beneficial ownership information and (c) such reports shall not be required
to include any exhibits that would have been required to be filed pursuant to Item 601 of Regulation S-K (except
this clause (c) shall not apply to any annual, quarterly or pro forma financial statements otherwise expressly
required to be provided under this covenant).

The Company will (x) deliver such information and such reports (as well as the details regarding the

conference call described below) to the Trustee under the Indenture, to any Holder of a Note and, upon request,
to any beneficial owner of the Notes, in each case by posting such information on Intralinks or any comparable
password-protected online data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and will make such
information readily available to any prospective investor in the Notes that certifies to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Company that it is an eligible purchaser of the Notes, any securities analyst (to the extent providing
analysis of investment in the Notes and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) or any market maker in the
Notes (who is reasonably satisfactory to the Company), in each case (i) who agrees to treat such information as
confidential or (ii) accesses such information on Intralinks or any comparable password-protected online data
system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment; provided that the Company shall post such
information thereon and make readily available any password or other login information to any such prospective
investor in the Notes, any such securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or
any such market maker in the Notes or (y) otherwise provide substantially comparable availability of such reports
(as determined by the Company in good faith) (it being understood that, without limitation, making such reports
available on Bloomberg or another private electronic information service shall constitute substantially
comparable availability). The Company will hold a quarterly conference call (which may be a single conference
call together with investors holding other securities or debt of the Company and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries or
any direct or indirect parent company) for all Holders and securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of
investment in the Notes) to discuss such financial information promptly after distribution of such financial
information. The Company may deny access to any competitively-sensitive information otherwise to be provided
pursuant to this section to any Holder, prospective investor, securities analyst or market marker that is a
competitor of the Company and its Subsidiaries or an affiliate of such a competitor to the extent that the
Company determines in good faith that the provision of such information to such Person would be competitively
harmful to the Company and its Subsidiaries; and provided that such Holders, prospective investors, security
analysts or market makers will agree to (1) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and
information as confidential, (2) not use such reports and the information contained therein for any purpose other
than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (3) not publicly disclose or distribute to any
competitor any such reports (and the information contained therein).

To the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company will also furnish to Holders, securities analysts (to

the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) and prospective investors in the Notes upon request the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and if any such

Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Company, then the annual and quarterly information required by the
first paragraph of this covenant shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of such Unrestricted
Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial statements, information and other documents required to be

provided as described above, may be those of (i) Holdings or Intermediate Holdings or (ii) any other direct or

200


-----

indirect parent of the Company; provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to such direct or
indirect parent of the Company, the same is accompanied by consolidating information that summarizes in
reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the
information relating to the Company on a standalone basis, on the other hand.

The Company will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to in the first paragraph of this covenant

if the Company, Holdings or any direct or indirect parent has filed reports containing such information with the
SEC.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and

the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge or notice of any information
contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with
any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate).
The Trustee will have no responsibility whatsoever to monitor whether such filing or posting has occurred or the
timeliness or content of such filing or posting.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or

premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(3) failure by the Company for 120 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders

of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements described in “Certain Covenants—Reports” and Other Information;

(4) failure by the Company or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee

or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes to comply with any of its obligations,
covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1), (2) or (3) above) contained in the
Indenture or the Notes;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is

secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now
exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated

final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the
obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or
holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such

indebtedness in default for failure to pay any principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any
applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $100.0 million or
more at any one time outstanding;

(6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken

together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $100.0 million, which final judgments

201


-----

remain unpaid, undischarged, unwaived and unstayed for a period of more than 90 days after such judgment
becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been
commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, or

any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Company), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary;

(8) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together

(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary, shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or any responsible officer of any Guarantor
that is a Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Company), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, as the
case may be, denies that it has any further liability under its or their Guarantee(s) or gives notice to such effect,
other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with
the Indenture;

(9) unless all the Collateral has been released from the Liens in accordance with the provisions of the

Security Documents, the Company shall assert or any Guarantor shall assert, in any pleading in a court of
competent jurisdiction, that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and, in the case of any such
Person that is a Subsidiary of the Issuer, the Issuer fails to cause such Subsidiary to rescind such assertions within
30 days after the Issuer has actual knowledge of such assertions; or

(10) the failure of the Company or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after receipt of written notice with

its other agreements contained in the Security Documents, except for a failure that would not be material to the
whole of the Notes and without materially affecting the value of the Collateral taken as a whole.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (7) above with respect to the Company)

occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of
the then total outstanding Notes by notice to the Company may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest
and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and

payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause
(7) above with respect to the Company, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action
or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing
Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that
withholding such notice is in their interest.

The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding

Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its
consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or
the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder. In the event of any Event of Default specified in
clause (5) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default,
other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and
without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or

(2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving

rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

202


-----

The Indenture will provide that, at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes, the

Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may rescind and cancel such declaration and its
consequences:

(1) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree;

(2) if all existing Events of Default have been cured, waived, annulled or rescinded except nonpayment of

principal or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration;

(3) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest and

overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid; and

(4) if the Company has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the Trustee for its

expenses, disbursements and advances.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any

of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders
have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to
enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Note
may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee, in

writing, to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or

expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of

security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a

written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total

outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in
personal liability.

The Indenture will provide that the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement

regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required, within five Business Days, after
becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default.

**Limited Condition Acquisition; Measuring Compliance**

With respect to any (x) acquisition or similar Investment for which the Company or any Subsidiary of the

Company may not terminate its obligations due to a lack of financing for such acquisition or similar Investment
(whether by merger, consolidation or other business combination or the acquisition of Capital Stock or otherwise) as
applicable or (y) repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness with respect to which an irrevocable notice
of repayment (or similar irrevocable notice) has been delivered, in each case, for purposes of determining:

(1) whether any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is being incurred in connection with

such acquisition or similar Investment or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is permitted to be

203


-----

incurred in compliance with the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(2) whether any Lien being incurred in connection with such acquisition or similar Investment or repayment,

repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness or to secure any such Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred in
accordance with the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Liens” or the definition of
“Permitted Liens”;

(3) whether any other transaction undertaken or proposed to be undertaken in connection with such

acquisition or similar Investment or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness complies with the
covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or the Notes; and

(4) any calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, Consolidated

Secured Debt Ratio, Net Income, Consolidated Net Income and/or EBITDA and, whether a Default or Event of
Default exists in connection with the foregoing,

at the option of the Company, using the date that the definitive agreement for such acquisition or similar
Investment or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is entered into (the “Transaction Agreement
_Date”) may be used as the applicable date of determination, as the case may be, in each case with such pro forma_
adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition
of “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” or “EBITDA.” For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company elects to use the
Transaction Agreement Date as the applicable date of determination in accordance with the foregoing, (a) any
fluctuation or change in the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, Consolidated
Secured Debt Ratio, Net Income, Consolidated Net Income or EBITDA of the Company, the target business or
assets to be acquired subsequent to the Transaction Agreement Date and at or prior to the consummation of such
acquisition or similar Investment or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, will not be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether any Indebtedness or Lien that is being incurred in connection with
such acquisition or similar Investment or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is permitted to be
incurred or in connection with compliance by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries with any other
provision of the Indenture or the Notes or any other transaction undertaken in connection with such acquisition or
similar Investment or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness and (b) until such acquisition or
similar Investment or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is consummated or such definitive
agreements are terminated, such acquisition or similar Investment or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of
Indebtedness and all transactions proposed to be undertaken in connection therewith (including the incurrence of
Indebtedness and Liens) will be given pro forma effect when determining compliance of other transactions
(including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens unrelated to such acquisition or similar Investment or
repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness) that are consummated after the Transaction Agreement
Date and on or prior to the consummation of such acquisition or similar Investment or repayment, repurchase or
refinancing of Indebtedness and any such transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof) will be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such
agreement and before the consummation of such acquisition or similar Investment or repayment, repurchase or
refinancing of Indebtedness; provided that in connection with the making of Restricted Payments, the calculation
of Consolidated Net Income (and any defined term a component of which is Consolidated Net Income) will not,
in any case, assume such acquisition or similar Investment has been consummated. In addition, the Indenture will
provide that compliance with any requirement relating to absence of Default or Event of Default may be
determined as of the Transaction Agreement Date and not as of any later date as would otherwise be required
under the Indenture. In the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion
thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken on the same date that any
other item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued,
any other Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio will be calculated with respect to such

204


-----

incurrence, issuance or other transaction without regard to any other incurrence, issuance or transaction. Each
item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is incurred or issued, each Lien incurred and
each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, issued or taken first, to the extent
available, pursuant to the relevant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, manager, incorporator, member, partner or

stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their Subsidiaries or direct or indirect parent companies shall
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees or the
Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder
by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and
it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will

terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuer
may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Notes and
have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then
existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and

interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of such

Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in connection

therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each

Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture (“Covenant
_Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with_
respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Company) described under “Events of Default
and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S.

dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants, investment bank or appraisal firm, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due
on the Notes on the stated maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal,
premium, if any, or interest on such Notes (provided that if such redemption is made as provided under “Optional
redemption,” (x) the amount of cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, that the

205


-----

Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited will be determined using an assumed Applicable
Premium calculated as of the date of such deposit and (y) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be
deposited additional money in trust on the redemption date as necessary to pay the Applicable Premium as
determined on such date) and the Issuer must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a
particular redemption date; provided, upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium,
the amount deposited will be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited
with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any
deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be
deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit will be set
forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable
Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit will be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel

confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuer have received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue

Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax

law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel

confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

Additionally, if the Issuer enters into a new ABL Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall, upon request

of the Issuer, enter into a new ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of any Holder.

**Payments for Consent**

The Indenture will not contain limitations on the Company’s ability to pay, or cause to be paid, any

Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any

degree of care that a prudent person would use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. The
Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of

224


-----

simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed
_Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro_
_forma effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repurchase, redemption, retirement or extinguishment of_
Indebtedness, or such issuance, repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same
had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period for which internal financial statements are
available; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give any effect to any Indebtedness
incurred on such determination date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock.”

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,

amalgamations, mergers (including the Transactions), consolidations and discontinued operations (as determined
in accordance with GAAP), Subsidiary designations and any operational changes or cost savings initiatives that
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has determined to make/or has made during the four-quarter
reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such
Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, amalgamations, mergers, consolidations, discontinued operations and
operational changes (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in EBITDA
resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If since the beginning of
such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or
consolidated with or into the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period
shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, amalgamation, merger, consolidation, discontinued
operation or operational change that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment,
acquisition, disposition, discontinued operation, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or operational change had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an Investment, acquisition,

disposition, amalgamation, merger (including the Transactions), consolidation, discontinued operation or
operational change, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Company (and may include (to the extent not already included in EBITDA) (a) cost
savings (including sourcing), operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies
resulting from such Investment, acquisition, disposition, amalgamation, merger, consolidation (including the
Transactions), discontinued operation or operational change, which is being given pro forma effect that have
been or are expected to be realized and reasonably identifiable and factually supportable and are reasonably
anticipated to be realized within 24 months after the change, acquisition or disposition that is expected to result
in such cost savings, expense reductions, or operating improvements and other synergies and (b) adjustments of
the nature used in connection with the calculation of “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA” as set forth in footnote (2) to “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial and Other Data” in this offering circular. If any Indebtedness bears a floating
rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the
rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized
Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in
accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based
upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to
have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the
Company may designate. Interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such indebtedness during the applicable period.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and

disposition of the Notes issued pursuant to this offering. This discussion applies only to notes that are held as
capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and is applicable only to holders who purchased the Notes for
cash at original issuance at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is
sold for cash to the public) and does not apply to any Notes purchased by an investor that currently holds 2018
Notes.

This discussion does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to

you in light of your particular circumstances, including the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on certain
investment income and the different consequences that may apply if you are subject to special rules that apply to
certain types of investors, such as:

   - financial institutions;

   - insurance companies;

   - dealers or traders subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to the Notes;

   - persons holding the Notes as part of a straddle, hedge, integrated transaction or similar transaction;

   - U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

   - partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and

   - tax-exempt entities.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns Notes, the tax

treatment of a partner may depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership and on
certain determinations made at the partner level. If you are a partner in a partnership considering an investment in
the Notes, you should consult your tax advisor as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences
applicable to you.

This discussion is based on the Code, and administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final,

temporary and proposed Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, changes to any of which subsequent to the
date of this offering memorandum may affect the tax consequences described herein.

This discussion does not address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. taxes, or any U.S. federal taxes other

than income taxes (such as gift and estate taxes). You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the
application of U.S. federal tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the
laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction.

**U.S. Holders**

This section applies to you if you are a “U.S. holder.” A U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of a note that is,

for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized in

or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes

regardless of its source; or

   - a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration

of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (ii) such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a
domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

244


-----

**_Stated Interest and Original Issue Discount_**

Stated interest on the Notes generally will be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is received or

accrued, depending on your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If, however, a Note’s
stated principal amount exceeds its issue price by an amount that does not satisfy a de minimis test, as
determined under applicable Treasury regulations, you will be required to include original issue discount
(“OID”) in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (regardless of your regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, and before the receipt of cash payments attributable to this income) in
accordance with a constant-yield method based on a compounding of interest. The rules regarding OID are
complex and you should consult your own tax advisors regarding their application.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption, or other taxable disposition of a Note, you generally will

recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon such disposition (less any
amount attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary income as discussed
above to the extent not previously included in income) and the adjusted tax basis of the note. Your adjusted tax
basis in a Note will, in general, be the amount paid for the note, and increased by any previously accrued OID.

Generally, any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate holders derived in

respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the Notes,

accruals of OID, if any, and the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including an exchange,
retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to you (unless you are an exempt recipient such as a corporation).
Backup withholding may apply to any payments described in the preceding sentence if you fail to provide a
taxpayer identification number or a certification that you are not subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules

may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).

**Non-U.S. Holders**

This section applies to you if you are a “non-U.S. holder.” A non-U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of a note

that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

   - a nonresident alien individual, other than certain former citizens and long-term residents of the United

States subject to U.S. federal income tax as expatriates;

   - a foreign corporation; or

   - an estate or trust that is not a U.S. holder;

but does not include an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
disposition. If you are such an individual, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the sale or other disposition of a note.

245


-----

**_U.S. Federal Withholding Tax_**

The U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty)

will not apply to any payment of interest on the Notes (which, for purposes of this discussion of non-U.S.
Holders, includes any accrual of OID) under the “portfolio interest exemption,” provided that:

   - interest paid on the Notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the

United States (as discussed below under “—U.S. Federal Income Tax”);

   - you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes

of our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury regulations;

   - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us through actual or constructive equity

ownership;

   - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the Notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code;

and

   - either (1) you provide your name and address on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other

applicable form), and certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person or (2) you
hold your Notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of
applicable Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to non-U.S. holders that are pass-through
entities rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to a

30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed:

   - IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form), certifying an exemption from, or reduction

in, withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

   - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the Notes is not subject to

withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States (as discussed below under “—U.S. Federal Income Tax”).

The U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty)

generally will not apply to any gain that you realize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
disposition of a Note.

**_U.S. Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and any payment of interest on the Notes

(which, for purposes of this discussion of non-U.S. Holders, includes any accrual of OID) is effectively
connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or a fixed base), then you will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on that interest on a net income basis at graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in generally the same manner
as if you were a U.S. holder, and, if you are a foreign corporation, you may also be subject to a “branch profits
tax” at a rate of 30% (or, if applicable, a lower treaty rate).

Any gain realized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note (such

amount excluding any amount allocable to accrued and unpaid interest, which will be treated as interest)
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, unless the gain is effectively connected with your
conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or a fixed base), in which case gain or loss will be calculated
generally in the same manner as if you were a U.S. holder and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in
generally the same manner as described in the preceding paragraph for effectively connected interest.

246


-----

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Generally, we must report to the IRS and to you the amount of interest paid to you (including accruals of

OID, if any) and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the information
returns reporting such interest payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in
the country in which you reside or are established under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the Notes

that we make to you, provided that we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United
States person, and received from you the required certification that you are a non-U.S. holder described above in
the fifth bullet point under “—U.S. Federal Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds

of a sale or other taxable disposition (including an exchange, retirement or redemption) of the Notes within the
United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the
applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that you are a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not
have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person), or you otherwise establish an
exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules

may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_FATCA Withholding Taxes_**

Provisions of the Code and applicable Treasury regulations, commonly referred to as “FATCA,” impose

withholding of 30% on payments of U.S.-source interest and, after December 31, 2018, on sales or redemption
proceeds of the Notes, paid to “foreign financial institutions” (which is broadly defined for this purpose and in
general includes investment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless various U.S. information
reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or
accounts with those entities) have been satisfied, or an exemption applies, which is typically evidenced by
delivery of a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN-E. An intergovernmental agreement between the United
States and the entity’s jurisdiction may modify these requirements. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a
beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally will be entitled to a refund of any amounts
withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden). You
should consult your tax advisor regarding the effects of FATCA on your investment in the Notes.

**The preceding summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and**

**disposition of the Notes is for general information only and is not tax advice. Accordingly, you should**
**consult your own tax advisor as to particular tax considerations to you of owning and disposing of the**
**Notes, including the applicability and effect of other U.S. federal tax laws, the laws of any state, local or**
**non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or any applicable tax treaty, and of any proposed changes in applicable law.**

247


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition of the Notes by an

“employee benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”)) that is subject to ERISA, (B) a “plan” that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (C) a
governmental plan, church plan or non-U.S. plan subject to applicable law that is similar in purpose or effect to
the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar
Law”) or (D) any entity deemed under ERISA to hold “plan assets” of any of the foregoing by reason of an
employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of

ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of
an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who
exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the
management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or
other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine

whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan
including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified

transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is
available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of
the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with
respect to which we, an initial purchaser or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person
may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable
statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or

“PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and/or holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without
limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers,
PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective
investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23 respecting
transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its
affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or render any investment
advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the
ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no
assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

248


-----

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets”

of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by the acquisition and/or holding of a note, or any interest in a note, each purchaser and

subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets
used to acquire or hold the note, or any interest therein, constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition and
holding of the Notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity

of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited
transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and
holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an
exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes.

Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the

Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction
rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws. We make no representation as to whether an investment in
the Notes is appropriate for any Plan in general or whether such investment is appropriate for any particular plan
or arrangement.

249


-----

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The notes are being offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A

Notes”). Notes also may be offered and sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S
Notes”). Except as set forth below, notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of
$2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by notes
in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S
Notes initially will be represented by temporary global notes in registered, global form without interest coupons
(collectively, the “Temporary Regulation S Global Notes”). Each Temporary Regulation S Global Note will be
exchangeable for a single permanent note in registered, global form (each a “Permanent Regulation S Global
Note” and, together with a Temporary Regulation S Global Note, a “Regulation S Global Note” and together
with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”) after the expiration of the “distribution compliance
period” (as defined in Regulation S) and the certification required by Regulation S. Prior to such time, a
beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification
from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act), or a QIB, in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note whether
before, on or after such time, only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S. The Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with
the trustee, as custodian for DTC, and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an
account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below.

The Global Notes (and any notes issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain restrictions on

transfer set forth therein and in the indenture and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions set forth under
the heading “Notice to Investors” herein. Subject to such restrictions, QIBs or non-U.S. purchasers may elect to
take physical delivery of their certificates in registered form (each a “Certificated Security”) instead of holding
their interests through the Global Notes (and which are then ineligible to trade through DTC) (collectively
referred to herein as the “Non-Global Purchasers”). Upon the transfer to a QIB of any Certificated Security
initially issued to a Non-Global Purchaser, such Certificated Security will, unless the transferee requests
otherwise or the Global Notes have previously been exchanged in whole for Certificated Securities, be
exchanged for an interest in the Global Notes. For a description of the restrictions on transfer of Certificated
Securities and any interest in the Global Notes, see “Notice to Investors.”

**The Global Notes**

We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC

or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount of the individual beneficial interests
represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary
(“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer
of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to
interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than
participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through
participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in
such system, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such system.

So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the Notes, DTC or such nominee, as the

case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all
purposes under the indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that
interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture with
respect to the Notes.

250


-----

Payments of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its

nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. Neither we, the trustee nor any paying agent will
have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of
beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records
relating to such beneficial ownership interest.

We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and

interest on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their
respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its
nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held
through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case
with securities held for the accounts of customers, registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such
payments will be the responsibility of such participants.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds

system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery
of a Certificated Security for any reason, including to sell notes to persons in states that require physical delivery
of the notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance
with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the indenture.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the

presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However,
if there is an event of default under the indenture, DTC will exchange the applicable Global Notes for
Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under
the heading “Notice to Investors.”

DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the

State of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the
Uniform Commercial Code and a “Clearing Agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and facilitate the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its
participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Participants include securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Indirect
access to the DTC system is available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly.

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the

Global Notes among participants of DTC they are under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility or liability
for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of its obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated Securities**

Certificated Securities shall be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the Global Notes (i) if requested

by a holder of such interests that is a Non-Global Purchaser or (ii) if DTC is at any time unwilling or unable to
continue as a depositary for the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 90 days.

251

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any jurisdiction, and

may not be offered or sold, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of, the Securities Act and such other securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes are being

The purchase agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated to purchase all of the Notes if any

are purchased. The purchase agreement also provides that if an Initial Purchaser defaults the purchase
commitments of non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or the offering may be terminated. The Initial
Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the offering price on the cover page of this offering
memorandum and may also offer the Notes to selling group members at the offering price less a selling
concession. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold

within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to qualified persons
reasonably believed to be institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons in

to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them
by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer
Restrictions.”

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the

United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in the offering), may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.

**Canada**

The Notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal

that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection
73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103
Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the Notes must be
made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of
applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for

rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a

254

misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should
refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for
particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter
conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), and no advertisement, invitation or document
relating to the Notes may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue
(in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are
likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws

**European Economic Area**

In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus

Directive (each, a “Relevant Member State”), each initial purchaser has represented and agreed that an offer to
the public of any Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated herein may not be made in that
Relevant Member State, except that an offer to the public in that Relevant Member State of any notes may be
made at any time under the following exemptions under the Prospectus Directive, if they have been implemented
in that Relevant Member State:

(a) to legal entities which are qualified investors as defined under the Prospectus Directive;

(b) by the Initial Purchasers to fewer than 100, or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the
relevant provisions of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than
qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive,
subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Representative of the Initial Purchasers for any such offer;
or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, provided that no
such offer of notes shall result in a requirement for us or any Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of
the Prospectus Directive.

Each person in a Relevant Member State who receives any communication in respect of, or who acquires

any notes under, the offers contemplated here in this offering memorandum will be deemed to have represented,
warranted and agreed to and with each Initial Purchaser and us that:

(a) it is a qualified investor as defined under the Prospectus Directive; and

(b) in the case of any notes acquired by it as a financial intermediary, as that term is used in Article 3(2) of
the Prospectus Directive, (i) the notes acquired by it in the offering have not been acquired on behalf
of, nor have they been acquired with a view to their offer or resale to, persons in any Relevant Member
State other than qualified investors, as that term is defined in the Prospectus Directive, or in the

256


-----

circumstances in which the prior consent of the Representative of the Initial Purchasers has been given
to the offer or resale or (ii) where notes have been acquired by it on behalf of persons in any Relevant
Member State other than qualified investors, the offer of such notes to it is not treated under the
Prospectus Directive as having been made to such persons.

For the purposes of this representation and the provision above, the expression an “offer of notes to the

public” in relation to any notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any
means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and any notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to
decide to purchase or subscribe for the notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any
measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State, the expression “Prospectus
Directive” means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive,
to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State), and includes any relevant implementing measure in
each Relevant Member State and the expression “2010 PD Amending Directive” means Directive 2010/73/EU

**General**

We have agreed that we will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or

indirectly, or file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to, any U.S. dollardenominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by us and having a maturity of more than one year from the
date of issue, or publicly disclose our intention to make any offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, without the
prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering
memorandum.

We have agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against liabilities or to contribute to payments

which it may be required to make in that respect.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Initial Purchasers have

advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated,
however, to make a market in the Notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at their sole
discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the
Notes.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and

penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

   - Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial

Purchasers.

   - Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do

not exceed a specified maximum.

   - Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been

completed in order to cover short positions.

   - Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the

Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover
short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be

higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be
discontinued at any time.

The Initial Purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include

securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal

257


-----

investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us from
time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and, in the future, may
act or continue to act as agents and/or lenders to us, for which services they have received or expect to receive
customary compensation, including under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates

may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own
account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such
securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments
of ours or our affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and
may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We

conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the

consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,

the financial position of PQ Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Emphasis of Matter**

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which

it classifies deferred taxes in 2015 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes and in which it classifies deferred finance costs in 2015 due to the adoption of
Accounting Standards Update 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Our opinion is not
modified with respect to this matter.

**1. Background and Basis of Presentation:**

PQ Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) conducts operations through three principal businesses:

Performance Chemicals: a fully integrated, global leader in silicate technology, producing sodium silicate,
specialty silicas, zeolites, spray dry silicates, magnesium silicate, and other high performance chemical products
used in a variety of end-uses such as adsorbents for surface coatings, clarifying agents for beverages, cleaning
and personal care products; Catalysts: an integrated silica catalyst and specialty zeolite-based catalyst producer
with leading global market positions, producing silica catalyst used in the production of high-density
polyethylene (“HDPE”), and specialty zeolite-based catalysts sold to the emissions control industry, the
petrochemical industry and other areas of the broader chemicals industry; and Specialty Glass Materials: a
leading global producer of engineered glass products for use in highway safety, polymer additives, metal
finishing and electronics end markets, which is comprised of Highway Safety and Engineered Glass Materials
(“EGM”). Highway Safety manufactures glass beads used for airport, highway and road safety applications to
improve visibility in wet and nighttime driving conditions, where EGM produces solid and hollow glass spheres
for use as polymer additives and fillers in specialized plastics, as engineered peening beads in metal finishing and
as conductives in consumer electronics and other applications.

We experience some seasonality, primarily with respect to the Specialty Glass Materials business. As the

road striping season occurs during warmer weather, sales and earnings are generated primarily during the second
and third quarters. Working capital is built during the first half of the year, while cash generation occurs
primarily in the second half of the fiscal year.

On May 31, 2007, PQ Corporation and its parent company, Niagara Holdings, Inc., entered into an

Agreement and Plan of Merger with affiliates of The Carlyle Group (“2007 Sponsor”), including CPQ Holdings
LLC (“CPQ Holdings”),and an affiliate of the previous owner of the Company, J.P. Morgan Partners, pursuant to
which PQ Corporation continued as the surviving corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CPQ
Holding Corporation, which was a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CPQ Holdings (the “2007 Merger”). The
2007 Merger was consummated on July 30, 2007.

On July 2, 2008, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities from and certain stock of the entities

that comprised INEOS Silicas, a division of INEOS Group that was a global manufacturer of inorganic chemicals
based on silica and alumina technology, from INEOS Capital Partners, formerly named INEOS Investments
Partnership (“INEOS”) in exchange for cash and shares of CPQ Holding Corporation (the “2008 INEOS Silicas
Acquisition”). After the closing of the 2008 INEOS Silicas Acquisition, INEOS Silicas was incorporated into the
Performance Chemicals and Catalyst divisions of the Company. Since July 2, 2008, the financial statements
include the results of operations of the acquired business.

On January 29, 2014, CPQ Holding Corporation changed its name to PQ Holdings Inc. (“Holdings”).

On September 11, 2014, Holdings entered into a stock purchase agreement (as amended on November 18,

2014) pursuant to which affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC (“CCMP” or “2014 Sponsor”) and INEOS,
one of the existing stockholders of Holdings, acquired stock of Holdings from CPQ Holdings and certain other
selling stockholders (the “2014 Stock Purchase”). The 2014 Stock Purchase was consummated on December 29,
2014. Following consummation of the sale, The Carlyle Group no longer holds any shares of Holdings. The 2014
Stock Purchase did not qualify as a business combination.

On August 18, 2015, the Company announced that Eco Services Holdings LLC (“Eco Services”), the

Company and certain of their respective affiliates had signed a definitive agreement (the “Business Combination

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

_Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company and Eco Services will reorganize under a newly formed holding_
company (the “Combined Company”). The Combined Company will retain the PQ Corporation name. The
Company’s existing indirect shareholders (affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC (“CCMP”), affiliates of
INEOS Capital Partners and management) and Eco Services’ existing indirect equity holders (affiliates of CCMP
and management) will constitute the sole shareholders of the Combined Company immediately following the
closing of the business combination. The completion of the transactions is subject to certain closing conditions
that are customary for transactions of this type, including regulatory clearance.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:**

_Principles of Consolidation._ The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company

and its controlled subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies are recorded at cost plus the Company’s
equity in their undistributed earnings. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies are translated to U.S. dollars using

exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Adjustments resulting from translation of the balance sheets
and intercompany loans, which are considered permanent, are included in stockholders’ equity as part of
accumulated other comprehensive loss. Adjustments resulting from translation of certain intercompany loans,
which are not considered permanent and are denominated in foreign currencies, are included in other expense
(income), net in the consolidated statement of operations. Income and expense items are translated at average
exchange rates during the year. Net foreign exchange included in other expense, net was a loss of $21,059,
$23,387, and $4,414 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The foreign currency
losses realized in 2015, 2014, and 2013, were primarily driven by the non-permanent intercompany debt
denominated in local currency translated to U.S. dollars.

_Cash and Cash Equivalents._ Cash and cash equivalents include investments with original terms to

maturity of 90 days or less from the time of purchase.

_Restricted Cash._ Restricted cash, which is restricted as to withdrawal or usage, is classified separately

from cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. The proceeds from the New Markets Tax
Credit (“NMTC”) financing arrangement are restricted for use and are classified on our consolidated balance
sheet as a noncurrent asset. As of December 31, 2013, there remained $16,890 restricted cash that is required to
be used to fund the capital expenditure associated with the NMTC agreement and is recorded in other long-term
assets on the consolidated balance sheet. During 2014, the balance was fully used to fund the capital expenditure
associated with the NMTC agreement. See Note 13 to these consolidated financial statements for further
information.

_Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts._ Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the

invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of
the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. A specific reserve for bad debt is
recorded for known or suspected doubtful accounts receivable. For all other accounts, the Company recognizes a
reserve for bad debt based on the length of time receivables are past due and historical write-off experience.
Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is probable the receivable
will not be recovered. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. The Company does not
have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

_Inventories._ All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. All domestic inventories are valued

on the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method, and all other inventories are valued on the average cost and first-in,

F-9


-----

**PQ HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

first-out (“FIFO”) methods. When necessary, the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its
inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value, including any costs to sell or dispose. Appropriate
consideration is given to obsolescence, excessive inventory levels, product deterioration and other factors in
evaluating net realizable value.

_Prepaid and Other Current Assets._ Prepaid and other current assets primarily include prepayments on

insurance and property tax, current deposits, income tax receivables, current deferred tax assets, value-added
taxes, receivables from affiliates and other current assets.

_Property, Plant, and Equipment._ Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost and include

expenditures for new facilities and major renewals and betterments. The Company capitalizes the cost of furnace
rebuilds as part of property, plant and equipment. Plant and equipment under capital leases are carried at the
present value of minimum lease payments. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as
incurred. The Company capitalizes internal costs associated with the implementation of purchased software.
When property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the net carrying amount is eliminated
with any gain or loss on disposition recognized in earnings at that time.

Depreciation is generally provided on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets,

ranging up to thirty-three years for buildings, ten to twelve years for machinery and equipment, and three to
seven years for computer hardware and software.

_Investments._ Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment

provides us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is
generally deemed to exist if the Company’s ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee ranges between
20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee’s board of directors and the impact
of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is
appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting, the investments in equity-method investees are recorded in
the consolidated balance sheets as investments in affiliated companies and the investees’ earnings or losses
together with other-than temporary impairments in value is recorded as equity in net income from affiliated
companies in the consolidated statements of operations.

_Goodwill and Intangible Assets._ Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful

life. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually
or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value
of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. A write-down occurs in periods in which it is determined that a
reporting unit’s fair value is less than its book value.

Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to perform an impairment test at least annually.

When evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company can perform a qualitative step zero assessment. If the
Company elects to skip or fails the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative assessment on the reporting units is
performed. Under a qualitative assessment, the Company will consider the relevant events and circumstances and
the extent to which they could affect the comparison of a reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying amount and form
a conclusion indicating whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying
amount. The quantitative assessment is a two-step test. In step one the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is
compared to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, then step two is required.
In step two the actual amount of the goodwill impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the
reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value is determined in the
same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. See Note 11 to these consolidated
financial statements for further discussion on goodwill impairment.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

_Other Long-term Assets._ Other long-term assets primarily include pension benefits, deferred tax assets,

and spare parts.

_Valuation of Long-Lived Assets._ The Company performs an impairment review of property, plant, and

equipment and definite-lived intangible assets when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not
be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows. When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, if the
carrying amount of an asset or asset group is found not to be recoverable, then an impairment loss is recognized.
Any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. Fair value is
determined using quoted market prices where available, or other techniques including discounted cash flows. The
Company’s estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance,
economic conditions, and technological changes that may affect the future useful lives of the assets.

_Derivative Financial Instruments._ The Company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to

enhance its ability to manage risk, including exposures to interest rates and natural gas price fluctuations that
exist as part of ongoing business operations. Derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with
the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures.

All derivatives designated as hedges are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date a

derivative contract is entered into, the Company may designate the derivative as a hedge of a forecasted
transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash
flow hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies
as a cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that the derivative is
effective as a hedge, until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item,
and the ineffective portion is reported in earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated
or does not qualify as a cash flow hedge are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. Cash flows
from derivative instruments are reported in the same cash flow category as the cash flows from the items being
hedged.

The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well

as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes
relating all derivatives that are designated cash flow hedges to underlying forecasted transactions. The Company
also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each hedging
relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item
during the period. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases
to be a highly effective hedge, hedge accounting would be discontinued with respect to that derivative
prospectively.

_Fair Value Measurements._ The Company measures fair value using the guidelines under U.S. generally

accepted accounting principles. Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a
current transaction between market participants. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be
paid to transfer the liability to a market participant, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with
the creditor. See Note 4 to these consolidated financial statements regarding the application of fair value
measurements.

The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair

value due to the short-term nature of these items. See Note 13 to these consolidated financial statements
regarding the fair value of debt and Note 15 regarding other financial instruments.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

_Revenue Recognition._ Revenue, net of related discounts and allowances, is recognized when both title and

risk of loss of the product have been transferred to the customer, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or
determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Customers
take title and assume all the risks of ownership upon shipment (if terms are “FOB shipping point”) or upon
delivery (if terms are “FOB destination”). Any deviation from the standard terms and arrangements are reviewed
for the proper accounting treatment, and revenue recognition is revised accordingly.

The Company recognizes rebates given to customers as a reduction of revenue based on an allocation of the

cost of honoring rebates earned and claimed to each of the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress
by the customer toward earning the rebate. Rebates are recognized at the time revenue is recorded. The Company
measures the rebate obligation based on the estimated amount of sales that will result in a rebate at the adjusted
sales price per the respective sales agreement.

_Shipping and Handling Costs._ Amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and

handling, if any, represent revenues earned for the goods provided and is classified as revenue. Costs related to
shipping and handling of products shipped to customers are classified as cost of goods sold.

_Research and Development._ Research and development costs of $10,264, $9,142, and $8,661, for the years

ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, were expensed as incurred and reported in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

_Income Taxes._ The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to tax filing

requirements and audit within these jurisdictions. The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting
for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis
of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect
for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than
not that those assets will be realized.

In determining the provision for income taxes, the Company provides deferred income taxes on income

from foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are taxable upon remittance to the United States. The Company
establishes contingent liabilities for possible assessments by taxing authorities resulting from uncertain tax
positions including, but not limited to, transfer pricing, deductibility of certain expenses and other state, local,
and foreign tax matters. The Company recognizes a financial statement benefit for positions taken for tax return
purposes when it will be more-likely-than-not that the positions will be sustained. The Company recognizes
potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax
examinations are often complex as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by the
Company and may require several years to resolve. These accrued liabilities represent a provision for taxes that
are reasonably expected to be incurred on the basis of available information but which are not certain.

_Asset Retirement Obligation._ The Company records a liability when the fair value of any future obligation

to retire a long-lived asset as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance or contract is reasonably
estimable. The Company also records a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if
the fair value can be reasonably estimated. When the liability is initially recorded, the Company capitalizes the
cost by increasing the amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the Company adjusts the liability to its
present value by recognizing accretion expense as an operating expense in the consolidated statement of

F-12


-----

**PQ HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

operations each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon
settlement of the liability, the Company records a gain or loss if the actual costs differ from the accrued amount.

The Company has recorded asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) in other long-term liabilities in order to

recognize legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. The Company has
assessed whether an ARO is required at each manufacturing facility and has recorded an obligation for those
location for which an obligation exists. The most significant of these are primarily attributable to environmental
remediation liabilities associated with current operations that were incurred during the course of normal
operations. The Company has AROs that are conditional in nature. The Company identified certain conditional
AROs upon which it was able to reasonably estimate their fair value and recorded a liability. These AROs were
triggered upon commitments by the Company to comply with local, state, and national laws to remove
environmentally hazardous materials. The AROs have been recognized on a discounted basis using a credit
adjusted risk free rate. Accretion of the AROs is recorded in other operating expense and amounted to $304,
$296, and $305, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Following are changes in
the ARO liability during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:

_Environmental Expenditures._ Environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or to future

revenues are expensed or capitalized consistent with the Company’s capitalization policy for property, plant and
equipment. Expenditures that result from the remediation of an existing condition caused by past operations and
that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Liabilities are recognized for remedial activities
when the remediation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of expenditures for
environmental remediation are recognized as assets only when recovery is deemed probable. See Note 20 to these
consolidated financial statements regarding commitments and contingencies and Note 12 regarding the accrued
environmental reserve.

_Stock-Based Compensation._ The Company applies the fair value based method to account for stock

options and awards. See Note 18 to these consolidated financial statements regarding compensation expense
associated with stock options and awards.

_Pensions and Postretirement Benefits._ The Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit

pension plans that cover employees in the United States and Canada, as well as certain employees in other
international locations. Benefits for a majority of the plans are based on average final pay and years of service.
Our funding policy, consistent with statutory requirements, is based on actuarial computations utilizing the
projected unit credit method of calculation. Not all defined benefit pension plans are funded. In the United States
and Canada, the pension plans’ assets include equity and fixed income securities. In our other international
locations, the pension plans’ assets include equity and fixed income securities, as well as insurance policies.
Certain assumptions are made regarding the occurrence of future events affecting pension costs, such as
mortality, withdrawal, disablement and retirement, changes in compensation and benefits, and discount rates to
reflect the time value of money.

F-13

**PQ HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

The major elements in determining pension income and expense are pension liability discount rates and the

expected return on plan assets. The Company references rates of return on high-quality, fixed income
investments when estimating the discount rate, and the expected period over which payments will be made based
upon historical experience. The long-term rate of return used to calculate the expected return on plan assets is the
average rate of return estimated to be earned on invested funds for providing pension benefits.

In addition to pension benefits, the Company provides certain health care benefits for employees who meet

age, participation and length of service requirements at retirement. These plans were closed to new retirees in the
United States and Canada as of December 31, 2006. The Company uses explicit assumptions using the best
estimates available of the plan’s future experience. Principal actuarial assumptions include: discount rates,
present value factors, retirement age, participation rates, mortality rates, cost trend rates, Medicare
reimbursement rates and per capita claims cost by age. Current interest rates, as of the measurement date, are
used for discount rates in present value calculations.

The Company also has defined contribution plans covering domestic employees of the Company and certain

subsidiaries.

_Contingencies._ Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may

result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
occur. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment
inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are
pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company and legal
counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived
merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency
indicates that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the
estimated liability is accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a loss
contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of
the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material,
would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve
guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed, including the approximate term, how
the guarantee arose, and the events or circumstances that would require the guarantor to perform under the
guarantee.

_Use of Estimates._ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles

generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

_Out of period adjustment._ Included in the 2015 financial statements are certain out of period adjustments

relating to errors that originated in 2014 and 2013. During 2015, the Company recorded a $3,064 charge to the
provision for income taxes and a corresponding credit to deferred taxes related to an out of period adjustment
associated with the accounting for deferred taxes of Convertible Preferred Equity Instrument (CPEC), a hybrid
equity instrument. The Company has determined that the impact of these out of period adjustments were not
material to any of the years presented.

**3. Recently Issued Accounting Standards:**

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for leases. Under the new

guidance, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for most leases but will recognize expenses similar to
current lease accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a
modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2015-17, Balance

_Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance provides companies with the option to classify deferred tax_
liabilities and assets as non-current amounts, in a classified statement of financial position. For a particular tax
paying component of an entity within a particular tax jurisdiction, all deferred tax liabilities and assets, as well as
any related valuation allowance, shall be offset and presented as a single non-current amount. These new
requirements for nonpublic entities become effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017 and interim periods with annual reporting periods after December 15, 2018. A nonpublic entity may elect
early application as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. The Company has elected to adopt the
requirements of this standard as of December 31, 2015. In accordance with ASU 2015-17, in the December 31,
2014 consolidated balance sheet, the Company credited the current deferred tax asset by $8,076 and debited the
current deferred tax liability by $6, concurrently debiting the non-current deferred tax asset and the non-current
deferred tax liability by $1,653 and $6,417, respectively.

In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance that will change the requirements for reporting measurement

period adjustments to provisional amounts initially recognized in conjunction with a business combination.
Under GAAP, an acquiring entity currently is required to retrospectively adjust, in prior period financial
statements, the provisional amounts to reflect new information obtained during the measurement period (a
period, which may not exceed one year from the date of the business combination, during which the acquiring
entity may receive information about the facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date that, if
known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date). Under the
new guidance, adjustments to the provisional amounts will be reflected in the financial statements for the
reporting period in which the adjustments are determined, including by recognizing in current period earnings the
full effect of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects. The guidance requires that the
acquiring entity either present separately on the face of the current period income statement or disclose in the
notes to the current period financial statement, by line item, the amount of the adjustments made during the
current period. The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied
prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance with
earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. The
Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance (ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt

_Issuance Costs) that requires deferred financing costs to be presented as a direct reduction from the related debt_
liability in the financial statements rather than as a separately recognized asset, as is the current requirement
under U.S. GAAP. Under the new guidance, amortization of such costs will continue to be reported as interest
expense. In August 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2015-15 Presentation and Subsequent
_Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements) to include similar treatment_
for deferred financing costs associated with line of credit arrangements. The new guidance will be effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and must be adopted on a retrospective basis.

Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt the requirements of this standard as of
December 31, 2015. In accordance with ASU 2015-03, the Company has presented net deferred financing costs
of $4,228 and $6,141 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a direct reduction of long term debt.

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating

_the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Under this ASU, an entity will no longer be allowed to separately disclose_
extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or
transaction is unusual in nature and occurs infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted
ASU 2015-01 effective December 31, 2015. The adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance ASU 2015-08 that provides companies with

the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in
which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. The acquired entity may elect the option to apply
pushdown accounting in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs. If pushdown
accounting is not applied in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs, an acquired entity
will have the option to elect to apply pushdown accounting in a subsequent reporting period as a change in
accounting principle under GAAP. If pushdown accounting is applied to an individual change-in-control event,
that election is irrevocable. This guidance also requires an acquired entity that elects the option to apply
pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements to disclose information in the current reporting period
that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the effect of pushdown accounting. The Company has
adopted this guidance effective November 18, 2014, as the amendments are effective upon issuance. The
adoption of this new guidance did not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there

is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the issuance of the
financial statements. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosures would be required. This guidance will be
effective beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does
not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued accounting guidance that will significantly enhance comparability of revenue

recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The core principle of the
guidance is that revenue recognized from a transaction or event that arises from a contract with a customer
should reflect the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services
provided. To achieve that core principle the new guidance sets forth a five-step revenue recognition model that
will need to be applied consistently to all contracts with customers, except those that are within the scope of other
topics in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). Also required are enhanced disclosures to help users
of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows
from contracts with customers. The enhanced disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information about
contracts with customers, significant judgments made in applying the revenue guidance, and assets recognized
related to the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. These new requirements for nonpublic entities become effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019. A nonpublic entity may elect early application, but no earlier than
December 15, 2017, the effective date for public entities. The Company is assessing the impact of these new
requirements on our financial statements.

In April 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance amending existing requirements for reporting

discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, discontinued operations reporting will be limited to disposal
transactions that represent strategic shifts having a major effect on operations and financial results. The amended
guidance also enhances disclosures and requires assets and liabilities of a discontinued operation to be classified
as such for all periods presented in the financial statements. Public entities will apply the amended guidance
prospectively to all disposals occurring within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014 and
interim periods within those years. The Company has adopted this standard on January 1, 2015. Due to the
change in requirements for reporting discontinued operations described above, presentation and disclosures of
future disposal transactions after adoption may be different than under current standards.

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11 Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net

_Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. This update is intended_
to improve the consistency surrounding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss
carryforward exists, requiring the unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a reduction to a deferred tax asset
for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. The new requirements for
nonpublic entities are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2014, and for interim periods within
those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company has implemented the provisions of ASU 2013-11
in 2015.

**4. Fair Value Measurements:**

Fair values are based on quoted market prices when available. When market prices are not available, fair

value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating current market inputs for similar
financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality. In instances where there is little or no market
activity for the same or similar instruments, the Company estimates fair value using methods, models and
assumptions that management believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current
transaction price. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment which
becomes significant with increasingly complex instruments or pricing models. Where appropriate, adjustments
are included to reflect the risk inherent in a particular methodology, model or input used.

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value have been classified based upon a fair

value hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest ranking to fair values determined using unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest ranking to fair values determined
using methodologies and models with unobservable inputs (Level 3). The classification of an asset or a liability is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to its measurement. For example, a Level 3 fair value
measurement may include inputs that are both observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). The
levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

   - Level 1—Values are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets

accessible at the measurement date. Active markets provide pricing data for trades occurring at least
weekly and include exchanges and dealer markets.

   - Level 2—Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from

those willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by market data for the term of the instrument. Such inputs include market interest rates and
volatilities, spreads and yield curves.

   - Level 3—Certain inputs are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the

fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what hypothetical
market participants would use to determine a transaction price for the asset or liability at the reporting
date.

**_Restoration plan assets_**

The fair values of the Company’s restoration plan assets are determined through quoted prices in active

markets. Restoration plan assets are assets held in a Rabbi trust to fund the obligations of the Company’s defined
benefit supplementary retirement plans and include various stock and fixed income mutual funds. See Note 17 to
these consolidated financial statements regarding defined supplementary retirement plans.

**_Derivative contracts_**

Derivative assets and liabilities can be exchange-traded or traded over the counter (“OTC”). The Company

generally values exchange-traded derivatives using models that calibrate to market transactions and eliminate
timing differences between the closing price of the exchange-traded derivatives and their underlying instruments.
OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including
market-based inputs to models, model calibration to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or
alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. When models are used, the selection of a
particular model to value an OTC derivative depends on the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in,
the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. The Company generally uses
similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual
terms, market prices and rates, forward curves, measures of volatility, and correlations of such inputs. For OTC

F-18

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as forward contracts, swaps and options, model inputs can generally
be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, and model selection does not involve
significant management judgment.

The Company has interest rate caps and natural gas caps and swaps that are fair valued using Level 2 inputs.

In addition, the Company applies a credit valuation adjustment to reflect credit risk which is calculated based on
credit default swaps. To the extent that the Company’s net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset
the Company utilizes the counterparty’s default swap rate. If the net exposure under a specific master agreement
is a liability the Company utilizes a default swap rate comparable to PQ Holdings Inc. The credit valuation
adjustment is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing
to receive to assume the Company’s liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for the
Company’s assets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 the credit valuation adjustment resulted in a minimal
change in the fair value of the derivatives.

$197,093 $189,286

If inventories valued under the LIFO basis had been valued using the FIFO method, inventories would have

been $4,729 and $2,641 lower than reported at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The higher LIFO
basis of inventory compared to the FIFO method is due to the purchase accounting fair value step-up of inventory
associated with the 2007 Merger and subsequent acquisitions.

On May 1, 2015, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of a sodium silicate plant within the

Performance Chemicals business of the Company for a total purchase price of $12,000. The Company accounted
for the acquisition of these assets in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations.” Under the purchase
method of accounting, the acquired assets were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of
acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
estimated fair values. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was $3,143 and
$1,039, respectively, and principally included the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $2,454,
inventory of $689, and assumed liabilities of $1,039. The purchase price allocation, which is based on the
estimated fair value of net assets acquired, resulted in the Company recording goodwill of $9,896. The Company
believes that expected synergies of the acquisition is the primary reason that contributed to a total purchase price
that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. The pro
forma impact of this acquisition would not have been material to the Company’s results of operations for the
years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.

The Company completed its annual impairment assessments as of October 1, 2015 and 2014. For the annual

assessments, the Company performed the two-step quantitative assessment for each of the reporting units. Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To determine the fair value of each reporting
unit, the Company generally uses a market approach and an income, or discounted cash flow, approach.

In 2014, the Company determined fair value of its reporting units using only a market approach. The market

value was estimated using publicly traded comparable company values by applying their most recent EBITDA
multiples to the reporting unit’s trailing twelve months EBITDA as well as indicative values from the 2014 Stock
Purchase. As part of the 2014 Stock Purchase, the Company received bids on the various businesses which were
used to value its reporting units as part of the market approach.

In 2015, the Company determined fair value of its reporting units using both a market approach and an

income, or discounted cash flow, approach. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires various
assumptions including the use of projections of future cash flows and discount rates that reflect the risks
associated with achieving those cash flows. The key assumptions used in estimating the fair values were the
operating margin growth rates, revenue growth rates from implementation of strategic plans, the weighted
average cost of capital, the perpetual growth rate, and the estimated earnings market multiples of each reporting
unit. The market value was estimated using publicly traded comparable company values by applying their most
recent EBITDA multiples to the reporting unit’s trailing twelve months EBITDA. The income approach value

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates
are based on management’s assessment of a number of factors including the reporting unit’s recent performance
against budget as well as management’s ability to execute on planned future strategic initiatives. Discount rate
assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in those future cash flows.

At October 1, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of each of the five reporting units exceeded their respective

carrying values and, therefore, step two was not required.

The Company has trade names that are not subject to amortization of $104,415 and $108,972 as of

December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in trade names during the year was due to the foreign
currency impact. The Company performed an annual quantitative assessment on its intangibles not subject to
amortization and concluded that no impairment charge was warranted.

Gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization for intangible assets with estimable useful lives are

The amortization periods for formulations and product technology range from seven to twelve years. The

Company amortizes customer relationships over periods that range from nine to twenty years. Amortizable
trademarks are amortized over a ten year period. The amortization periods for the patents range from eight to
fourteen years.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company wrote off fully amortized patents

totaling $63, $4,047 and $338, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company
wrote off fully amortized noncompete agreements totaling $3,269 and $231, respectively

Total amortization of intangibles was $30,536, $31,438, and $32,217, for the years ended December 31,

loan in the amount of $1,220,000 with a maturity date of May 8, 2017. Borrowings under the first lien term
facilities bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate or the base rate elected by the Company at the time of
borrowing plus a margin of 4.25% or 3.25%, respectively. Further, the LIBOR or base rate elected under the
facilities are also subject to a floor of 1.00% and 2.00%, respectively. The senior credit facility requires
minimum quarterly principal payments of $3,050 on the first lien term loan, though such minimum payments
may be reduced in accordance with any prepayments or increased if the amount of the Term Loans is increased.

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

The loans and guarantees under the senior credit facility are secured by first-priority liens in substantially all

of the tangible and intangible assets of PQ Corporation and certain of its material subsidiaries, including pledges
of all present and future shares of capital stock of PQ Corporation and certain guarantors and each of PQ
Corporation’s and such guarantors’ material directly wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the present
and future shares of capital stock of each of PQ Corporation’s and such guarantors’ directly owned foreign
restricted subsidiaries (other than certain Cayman subsidiaries which guarantee the senior credit facility), in each
case subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and customary permitted liens.

The senior credit facility further requires prepayments from all “net cash proceeds” received and “excess

cash flow,” if applicable. In accordance with the senior credit facility, net cash proceeds generally relate to
proceeds received from the issuance or incurrence of certain indebtedness or proceeds received on the disposition
of assets, adjusted for certain costs and expenses, and are payable promptly upon receipt, subject in the case of
net cash proceeds from asset dispositions, to meeting the thresholds described below. Net cash proceeds in
respect of asset dispositions are not payable if such proceeds are reinvested in the Company’s business within a
certain specified time period or if they are under certain minimum amounts, both on an individual basis for any
given disposition and in the aggregate for dispositions that, individually, would not meet the threshold. Excess
cash flow is to be calculated annually and is defined as consolidated net income adjusted for various expenditures
and/or proceeds commencing with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2014. Prepayments with respect to
excess cash flow, if any, are to be made on an annual basis due within 10 days after the annual audited financials
are delivered to the lenders thereunder of each year. The detailed calculations supporting those two prepayments
are defined in the credit agreement. The remaining principal balance of the term loans are due upon maturity.

The senior credit facility provides for up to $150,000 in revolving credit borrowings. Borrowings under the

revolving facility bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR or base rate elected by the Company at the time of
borrowing plus a margin of 4.25% or 3.25%, respectively, subject to reduction based on certain leverage
thresholds. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee equal to 0.50%, with a step-down to 0.25% based on
certain leverage thresholds of the unused revolving credit borrowings available under the senior credit facility.
Revolving credit borrowings are payable at the option of the Company throughout the term of the senior credit
facility with the balance due May 8, 2017. As of December 31, 2015, there were no revolving credit borrowings
under the senior credit facility. In accordance with the terms of the Company’s senior credit facility, repayments
made by the Company relating to outstanding revolver borrowings are applied to all lenders on a pro-rata basis,
subject to certain exceptions.

The senior credit facility contains various non-financial restrictive covenants. It limits the ability of PQ

Corporation and its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain indebtedness or liens, merge, consolidate or liquidate,
dispose of certain property, make investments or declare or pay dividends, make optional payments, modify
certain debt instruments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or enter into certain sales and leasebacks,
and it also provides limitation on other non-financial restrictive covenants. The Senior Credit Facility also
contains one financial restrictive covenant. Commencing at the end of the first full fiscal quarter after the
effective date of the Agreement, which was November 8, 2012, as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the
Company for the four fiscal quarter period ending on such date, the Company’s Total Net First Lien Leverage
Ratio, as defined, must be less than 5.75:1.00 (4.75:1.00 as of December 31, 2015), with annual step-downs. At
December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants.

The Company may at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay the senior secured loans in whole or

in part without premium or penalty, except prior to the one year anniversary of the closing date, the Company
shall pay a prepayment premium in an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount prepaid.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

The Company has a $35,000 letter of credit sublimit under the senior credit facility subject to the

availability under the revolving credit facility. The Company has letters of credit outstanding of $5,279 as of
December 31, 2015, which reduce available borrowings under the revolving credit facility by such amounts.

**_Senior Secured Notes_**

On November 8, 2012, the Company issued $600,000 of 8.750% second lien senior secured notes due 2018

in transactions exempt from or not subject to registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A and
Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. The notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and rank
equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior debt and senior in right of
payment to all of the Company’ existing and future subordinated debt. The notes will be effectively subordinated
to all of the Company’s first lien senior secured debt, including the senior secured credit facility, to the extent of
the value of the assets securing such debt. The notes will also be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of PQ
Corporation’s existing and future non-guarantor subsidiaries. The indenture relating to the notes contains various
limitations on the Company’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay
dividends or repay certain debt, make loans and investments, sell assets, create liens, enter into transactions with
affiliates, enter into agreements restricting PQ Corporation’s subsidiaries ability to pay dividends, and merge and
consolidate with other companies, among other things. Interest on the notes is payable on May 1 and November 1
of each year, commencing May 1, 2013. No principal payments are required with respect to the notes prior to
their final maturity. The notes mature on November 1, 2018. The obligations of the Company under the notes and
the indenture are guaranteed by Holdings and CPQ Midco I Corporation, PQ Corporation’s direct parent, and
each of PQ Corporation’s subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the new senior secured credit facility. The
obligations of the Company under the notes and the indenture are secured by second-priority liens over
substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of Holdings and certain of its material subsidiaries,
including pledges of all present and future shares of capital stock of CPQ Midco I Corporation, PQ Corporation
and certain guarantors and each of PQ Corporation’s and such guarantors’ material directly wholly-owned
domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the present and future shares of capital stock of each of PQ Corporation’s and
such guarantors’ directly owned foreign restricted subsidiaries (other than certain Cayman subsidiaries which
guarantee the notes), in each case subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and customary permitted liens.

If any event of default (other than a default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of PQ

Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries) shall occur and be continuing, the trustee or holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of outstanding notes under the indenture may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable and the same shall become immediately due
and payable. If an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company
occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the notes shall become immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder will have the right to require the Company to

purchase all or any part of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest.

**_Other Debt_**

On October 24, 2013, the Company’s subsidiary Potters Industries, LLC (“Potters”) entered into a New

Markets Tax Credit (“NMTC”) financing arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and several of its
affiliates (“Chase”) and TX CDE V LLC, an affiliate of Texas LIC Development Company LLC d/b/a Texas
Community Development Capital (“TX CDE”) to fund the expansion of Potters’ manufacturing facility in Paris,

Texas (the “NMTC Agreement”). The NMTC program, which is administered by the United States Treasury
Department requires certain balance sheet commitments. The NMTC Agreement will provide the Company with
certain monetary benefits as an offset to specifically identified capital expenditures. The NMTC Agreement
requires that certain commitments and covenants be maintained over the course of the next 7 years, in order to
legally recognize the benefit. Chase agreed to contribute $6,634 and an additional $15,632 in funds lent to Chase
by Potters Holdings II, L.P. to TX CDE. TX CDE, in turn, lent $21,000 in the form of $5,368 and $15,632 notes,
or the Loans, to Potters, which used the proceeds of the Loans to finance the expansion of Potters’ manufacturing
facility in Paris, Texas. The capital expenditures associated with the NMTC Agreement were completed in 2014.
The $21,000 was outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

In connection with the NMTC transaction, the Company has provided an indemnification related to our

actions or inactions which cause either a NMTC disallowance or recapture event. In the event that we cause
either a recapture or disallowance of the tax credits expected to be generated under this program, then we will be
required to repay the disallowed or recaptured tax credits plus an amount sufficient to pay the taxes on such
repayment, to the counterparty of the agreement. This indemnification covers our actions and inactions prior to
September 6, 2020. The maximum potential amount of future payments under this indemnification is
approximately $12,600. The Company currently believe that the likelihood of us being required to make a
payment under this indemnification is remote.

The Company also has several note payable agreements denominated in Japanese Yen which currently

enables the Company to borrow up to a total of 260,000 Japanese Yen, or $2,158. Borrowings bear interest at
either TIBOR (“Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate”) plus a margin or the short-term prime rate with a weighted
average rate of 0.63% as of December 31, 2015 and as of December 31, 2014. The terms of the agreements vary
and are renewable upon expiration of the term with the balances due in 2016. Borrowings under the agreement
are payable at the option of the Company throughout the term of the agreements. Borrowings outstanding under
these agreements were $2,158 and $2,184 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain other note payable agreements. These agreements

are not further described as they are not significant to the consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a

current transaction. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the senior secured term loan and senior
secured bond was lower than book value by $30,760 and $3,206, respectively. The fair value of the senior
secured term loans and notes were derived from published loan prices at December 31, 2015 and 2014, as
applicable. The fair value is classified as Level 1 based upon the fair value hierarchy and is determined using
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities.

**15. Financial Instruments:**

The Company uses interest rate related derivative instruments to manage its exposure related to changes in

interest rates on its variable-rate debt instruments and uses commodity derivatives to manage its exposure to
commodity price fluctuations. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments.

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates and commodity

prices, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to
perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is an asset, the
counterparty owes the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative
contract is a liability, the Company owes the counterparty and, therefore, the Company is not exposed to the
counterparty’s credit risk in those circumstances. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk in derivative
instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties. The derivative instruments entered into
by the Company do not contain credit-risk-related contingent features.

Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a derivative instrument that results from a change in interest

rates, currency exchange rates, or commodity prices. The market risk associated with interest rate and commodity
price contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market
risk that may be undertaken.

_Use of Derivative Financial Instruments to Manage Commodity Price Risk._ The Company is exposed to

risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly natural gas. The Company has a hedging
program in the United States which allows the Company to mitigate exposure to natural gas volatility with
natural gas swap agreements. Fair value is determined based on estimated amounts that would be received or
paid to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on quoted market prices of comparable contracts. The
respective current and non-current liabilities are recorded in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities and
the respective current and non-current assets are recorded in prepaid and other current assets and other long-term
assets, as applicable. As the derivatives are highly effective and are designated and qualify as cash-flow hedges,
the related unrealized gains or losses are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive

F-32

**PQ HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

income (loss), net of tax. Realized gains and losses on natural gas hedges are included in production cost and
subsequently charged to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which
inventory is sold.

_Use of Derivative Financial Instruments to Manage Interest Rate Risk._ The Company is exposed to

fluctuations in interest rates on the long-term senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility. Changes in
interest rates will not affect the market value of such debt but will affect the amount of our interest payments
over the term of the loans. Likewise, an increase in interest rates could have a material impact on the Company’s
cash flow. The Company hedges the interest rate fluctuations on debt obligations through interest rate cap
agreements. The Company records these agreements at fair value as assets or liabilities. As the derivatives are
highly effective and are designated and qualify as cash-flow hedges, the related unrealized gains or losses are
deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Fair value is
determined based on estimated amounts that would be received or paid to terminate the contracts at the reporting
date based on quoted market prices.

During 2013, the Company entered into interest rate cap agreements, paying a premium of $995 to mitigate

interest rate volatility from September 2013 until March 2016, by employing a 2% cap rates on $800,000 of
notional variable debt.

The total tax provision of $22,902 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 on the Company’s

consolidated pre-tax income for the period differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% principally due to the
repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, foreign income tax in jurisdictions with statutory rates different than the U.S.
rate, state taxes, non-deductible transaction costs, foreign withholding taxes, changes in valuation allowance, and
changes in uncertain tax positions.

The total tax provision of $7,548 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 on the Company’s

consolidated pre-tax income for the period differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% principally due to the
repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, foreign income tax in jurisdictions with statutory rates different than the U.S.
rate, state taxes, non-deductible transaction costs, foreign withholding taxes, changes in valuation allowance, and
changes in uncertain tax positions.

The total tax provision of $10,608 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 on the Company’s

repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, foreign income tax in jurisdictions with statutory rates different than the U.S.
rate, state taxes, foreign withholding taxes, changes in valuation allowance, and changes in uncertain tax
positions.

Included in the 2015 deferred tax asset and liability amounts for depreciation, intangible assets, LIFO

investment in Potters Industries, LLC, which is a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. The Company and
one of its subsidiaries own in aggregate 100% of Potters Industries, LLC and the assets and liabilities of Potters
Industries, LLC are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

The $109,006 in net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2015 consists of $4,191 in net non-current

deferred tax assets and $113,197 in net non-current deferred tax liabilities.

The $107,798 in net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2014 consists of $6,687 in non-current

deferred tax assets and $114,485 in net non-current deferred tax liabilities.

The change in net deferred tax assets (liabilities) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily

related to the increase in deferred tax assets on accrued pension obligations, and book amortization of intangibles
with no corresponding tax basis.

The change in net deferred tax assets (liabilities) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily

related to the increase in deferred tax liabilities on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, partially
offset by the book amortization of intangibles with no corresponding tax basis.

The net change in the total valuation allowance was an increase of $900 in 2015. The valuation allowance at

December 31, 2015 was primarily related to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits
that, in the judgment of management, are not more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the realizability of
deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
Management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available
carryback and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies that are
prudent in making this assessment. In order to fully realize deferred tax assets, the Company will need to
generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards. The
amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates
of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.

Management considered certain earnings in non-U.S. subsidiaries to be available for repatriation in the

future. The tax cost associated with non-U.S. subsidiary earnings and distributions for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014 has been recorded as tax expense for the period. In this regard the Company
expects to deduct, rather than credit, foreign tax expense in computing the U.S. tax effects of repatriation from
non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2015 and 2014. The unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates that have
not been reinvested abroad indefinitely amount to $129,139 as of December 31, 2015. The deferred U.S. federal
and state income tax liability and deferred foreign withholding tax liability on these undistributed earnings is
estimated to be $49,767.

At December 31, 2015, the cumulative unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries outside the United States,

considered permanently reinvested, for which no income or withholding taxes have been provided, approximated
$94,475. Such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely and, as a result, no deferred tax liability has
been recognized with regard to such earnings. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these
unremitted earnings is not practicable principally because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances
existing if and when remittance occurs.

Included in the balance of total unrecognized tax benefits are potential benefits of $19,419 and $15,503, that

if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations as of December 31, 2015
and 2014, respectively.

Interest and penalties recognized related to uncertain tax positions amounted to ($1,313), $976 and $152 in

2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain
tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in
the period for which the event occurs requiring the adjustment. The accrued interest and penalties as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014 are $3,131 and $5,843, respectively, and are recorded in other long-term liabilities
in the consolidated balance sheet.

(a)—Includes federal as well as local jurisdictions

Given that the U.S. Company has net operating loss carryforwards, the statute for examination by taxing

authorities in the United States, and certain state jurisdictions, will remain open for a period following the use of
such net operating loss carryforwards extending the period for examination beyond the years indicated above.

The Company has subsidiaries in various states, provinces and countries that are currently under audit for

years ranging from 2003 through 2015. To date, no material adjustments have been proposed as a result of these
audits. As of December 31, 2015, the Company does not believe that there are any positions for which it is
reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease
within the next 12 months.

The Company has a net operating loss carry-forward (“NOL”) available of $288,017 to reduce future federal

taxes payable. The federal carry-forward period is 20 years. $29,278 relates to periods prior to the 2007 Merger.
$258,559 relates to periods after the 2007 Merger but prior to the 2014 Stock Purchase. $180 relates to periods
after the 2014 Stock Purchase. Both, the 2007 Merger and 2014 Stock Purchase triggered the change in control
provisions under IRC §382. Although subject to the limitations of IRC §382, management believes it is more
likely than not that the Company will realize the entire $287,837 in pre-transaction NOLs in future years. The
remaining $180 relates to NOLs generated following the 2014 Stock Purchase and would not be subject to IRC
§382.

For state income tax purposes the Company incurred net operating losses of $14,997 for 2015 that may be

carried forward at periods ranging from 5 to 20 years among the states in which the Company is subject to tax to
reduce future state income taxes payable. Cumulative state net operating losses carrying forward into 2016 are

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

$461,980. A valuation allowance of $12,789 has been applied against the total $18,511 of state net operating loss
deferred tax assets, leaving losses of $5,722 that have been recognized for financial accounting purposes for the
portion of those losses that the Company believes, on a more likely than not basis, will be realized.

Foreign net operating losses of $43,287, of which $14,563 will begin to expire in 2029 and the remaining

$28,724 carried forward indefinitely, are available to reduce future foreign income taxes payable. A valuation
allowance of $10,046 has been applied to $10,622 of deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss
carry-forwards, leaving a net deferred tax asset relating to foreign net operating losses of $576 that have been
recognized for financial accounting purposes.

**17. Benefit Plans:**

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering employees in the United States and Canada

and certain employees at its subsidiaries outside of North America (“Other”). Benefits for a majority of the Plans
are based on average final pay and years of service. The Company’s funding policy is to fund the minimum
required contribution under local statutory requirements. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date
for its defined benefit plans.

The Company sponsors unfunded plans to provide certain health care benefits to retired employees in the

United States and Canada. These plans were closed to new retirees in the United States and Canada as of
December 31, 2006. The plans pay a stated percentage of medical expenses reduced by deductibles and other
coverage. The plans are unfunded and obligations are paid out of the Company’s operations.

The Company also has defined benefit supplementary retirement plans which provide benefits for certain

U.S. employees in excess of qualified plan limitations. The obligations are paid out of the Company’s general
assets, including assets held in a Rabbi trust, or restoration plan assets.

The U.S. discount rates were determined by utilizing a yield curve model. The model develops a spot rate

curve based on the yields available from a broad based universe of high quality corporate bonds. The discount
rate is then set as the weighted average spot rate, using the plan’s expected benefit cash flows as the weights.

The rate of compensation increase on the U.S. plan was zero for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014,

and 2013, as all future accruals were frozen in the United States as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with the
plan amendment approved in 2005. The rate of compensation increase in determining the pension obligation on
the Canadian plan was 3.50% and 3.75% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The rate
of compensation increase in determining the net periodic benefit cost on the Canadian plan was 3.75% for the
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company
considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset
classes, and expected future performance. In addition, the Company may consult with and consider the opinions
of our external advisors in developing appropriate return benchmarks.

The investment objective for the U.S. plan is to generate returns sufficient to meet future obligations. The

strategy to meet the objective includes generating attractive returns using higher returning assets such as equity
securities and balancing risk using less volatile assets such as fixed income securities. The plan invests in an
allocation of assets across the three broadly-defined financial asset categories of equity, fixed income and cash.
The target allocations for plan assets are 45 percent equity securities and 55 percent fixed income investments.

Similar considerations are applied to the investment objectives of the non-U.S. plans as well as the asset

classes available in each location and any legal restrictions on plan investments.

The Company categorized plan assets into a Fair Value Hierarchy. The hierarchy consists of three levels as

follows:

   - Level 1—Values are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets

accessible at the measurement date. Active markets provide pricing data for trades occurring at least
weekly and include exchanges and dealer markets. Level 1 assets primarily include investments in

F-42


-----

**PQ HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

publicly traded equity securities and mutual funds. These securities (or the underlying investments of the
funds) are actively traded and valued using quoted prices for identical securities from the market
exchanges.

   - Level 2—Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from

those willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by market data for the term of the instrument. Such inputs include market interest rates and
volatilities, spreads and yield curves. Level 2 assets primarily consist of fixed-income securities and
comingled funds that are not actively traded or whose underlying investments are valued using observable
marketplace inputs. The fair value of plan assets invested in fixed-income securities is generally
determined using valuation models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields, lowvolume market quotes and quoted prices for similar assets. Plan assets that are invested in comingled
funds are valued using a unit price or net asset value (“NAV”) that is based on the underlying investments
of the fund.

   - Level 3—Certain inputs are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the

fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what hypothetical
market participants would use to determine a transaction price for the asset or liability at the reporting
date. Level 3 assets include investments covered by insurance policies and real estate funds valued using
significant un-observable inputs.

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

The estimated net actuarial loss (gain) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other

comprehensive loss into benefits cost in 2016 is $216 for our defined benefit supplementary retirement plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation of our defined benefit supplemental retirement plans for the years ended

December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $14,128 and $15,019, respectively.

The discount rate used in determining the supplemental retirement plan pension obligations was 4.00% and

3.60% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The discount rate used in determining net periodic benefit cost was 3.60%, 4.30%, and 3.30%, for the years

ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The rate of compensation increase for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, was zero as all future accruals were frozen for the defined
supplemental retirement plans as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with the plan amendment approved in
2005.

The Company expects to contribute $1,168 to the defined benefit supplementary retirement plans in 2016.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be

paid:

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**

There are no expected Medicare subsidy receipts expected in future periods.

Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain other postretirement benefit plans that are consistent

with statutory practices. These plans are not included in the disclosures above as they are not significant to the
consolidated financial statements.

**_Defined Contribution Plans_**

The Company also has defined contribution plans covering domestic employees of the Company and certain

subsidiaries. The Company recorded expenses of $6,638, $7,826, and $8,713, related to these plans for the years
ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

**18. Stock-Based Compensation:**

The Company applies the fair value based method to account for stock options and awards.

On January 29, 2014, CPQ Holding Corporation changed its name to PQ Holdings Inc.

On September 28, 2007, the Company established the CPQ Holding Corporation Stock Incentive Plan, (the

“Stock Incentive Plan”). On July 2, 2008, the Stock Incentive Plan was amended. The number of shares that may
be issued under the amended Stock Incentive Plan or be subject to awards may not exceed 692,495 shares. In
accordance with the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has the authority to issue restricted stock, options, stock
appreciation rights, deferred stock units, and dividends.

In 2007 and 2008, the Company issued 355,269 shares of restricted Class A common stock and 895 deferred

stock units under the Stock Incentive Plan. In February 2010, the Company issued 340,981 additional shares of
restricted Class A common stock under the Stock Incentive Plan, of which a portion of the shares were awarded
to certain employees new to the Stock Incentive Plan and a portion of the shares were awarded to certain
employees previously awarded shares in 2007 and 2008. The restricted stock includes three separate tranches for
vesting purposes; (1) Service shares, (2) Tranche 1 Performance shares, and (3) Tranche 2 Performance shares.
The Service shares’ vesting is based on satisfying certain service conditions and the Tranche 1 and Tranche 2
shares’ vesting is based on satisfying certain performance conditions. All of the Service shares vested on certain
dates during 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, subject to the employees’ continued service with the Company on
such dates. In connection with the 2014 Stock Purchase, the vesting of Tranche 1 Performance shares was
modified to provided that those shares will vest as follows: 100% of each grant fully vests on any Measurement
Date, as defined in the amendment to the shareholder’s restricted stock agreement, upon CCMP having received
Proceeds, as defined, resulting in an MOI, as defined, of at least 2.0, subject to the employee’s continued service
with the Company through the vesting date. “MOI” is defined, as of the Measurement Date, as the quotient
obtained on or prior to such Measurement Date by dividing (i) the sum of Proceeds received on such
Measurement Date and all prior Measurement Dates, by (ii) the Principal Investment. All of the Tranche 2
Performance shares vested when the Company met three specified annual EBITDA targets, subject to the
employees’ continued service with the Company on such dates when the EBITDA targets were met. The fair
value of the awards was determined using multiples of EBITDA and the income approach, based on discounted
free cash flow.

In 2015, the Company issued 57,923 shares of restricted Class D common stock and 34,628 shares of Class

C options. Both share issuances have various vesting features, including satisfying certain service based and
performance based conditions. The fair value of the Class D common stock awards was determined based on the
equity valuation from recent transactions. The fair value of the Class C options was determined using a BlackScholes option pricing model.

In conjunction with the 2007 Merger, the Company received $315,000 of capital. In connection with the

2008 INEOS Acquisition, the Company received an additional $192,830 of capital. During 2009, the Company
received an additional $2,250 of capital.

The 2007 Merger was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result of a 6.6%

continuing ownership interest in PQ Holdings Inc. by certain stockholders (“Continuing Stockholders”), 93.4%

of the purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired at their respective fair values with the
remaining 6.6% recorded at the Continuing Stockholders’ historical book values as of the date of the acquisition.
As a result of the carryover of the Continuing Stockholders’ historical basis, stockholders’ equity (deficit) of PQ
Holdings Inc. has been reduced by $53,532.

In connection with the 2014 Stock Purchase, Class C and Class D shares were authorized and issued. Class

C and Class D shares are identical to Class A and Class B shares, respectively, except they do not have voting
rights.

**20. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities:**

There is a risk of environmental impact in chemical manufacturing operations. The Company’s

environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to
minimize the possibility of significant environmental impact. The Company is also subject to various other
lawsuits and claims with respect to matters such as governmental regulations, labor, and other actions arising out
of the normal course of business. No accrual for these matters currently exists, with the exception of those listed
below, because management believes that the liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims are not probable
or reasonably estimable.

The Company triggered the requirement of New Jersey’s Industrial Site Recovery Act (“ISRA”) statute. As

required under ISRA, a General Information Notice with respect to the Company’s two New Jersey locations was
filed with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) in December 2004 and again in
July 2007. Based on an initial review of the facilities by the NJDEP in 2005, the Company estimated that $500
will be required for contamination assessment and removal work at these facilities, and had recorded a reserve
for such amount as of December 31, 2005. During subsequent years, it was determined that additional
assessment, removal and remediation work would be required and the reserve was increased to cover the
estimated cost of such work. In addition, during this period, work had been performed and the reserve was
reduced for actual costs incurred for the assessment and remediation work. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
the Company has recorded a reserve of $1,625 and $2,039 for costs required for contamination assessment and
remediation work at these facilities. The amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and
related costs/(benefits) were $0, $(89), and $1,500, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013,
respectively, and are recorded as other operation expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There may
be additional costs related to soil and ground water remediation, but until further investigation takes place, the
Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of additional liability that may exist.

As part of a Delaware River Basin Commission (“DRBC”) required Pollutant Minimization Plan (“PMP”),

in July 2013 the Company’s Chester facility conducted limited paint sampling for polychlorinated biphenyls
(“PCBs”). Also, as part of demolition, repair and maintenance projects scheduled for the Company’s Baltimore
facility in 2014, the Company conducted limited paint sampling during the fall of 2013 for waste categorization
purposes. Paint samples were analyzed for PCB Aroclor 1254, the specific PCB congener commonly used in the
manufacture of paint until the late 1970s. The Company’s analytical results indicated that PCB Aroclor 1254 is
present in paint on some structures (e.g., piping, structural steel, tanks) in excess of the fifty (50) parts per million
(“ppm”) regulatory threshold. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), there is no requirement to test
in use paint for PCB content. However, once PCB content is identified at concentrations at or above the
regulatory threshold, absent specific approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the
PCB-containing paint is regulated as an unauthorized use of PCBs, and the paint must be addressed. The
Company is preparing to abate painted surfaces that have tested positive for PCBs at levels exceeding 50 ppm in
2015. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a reserve of $2,157 and $2,644 for the
anticipated remediation costs of known PCB painted structures at the Company’s Baltimore and Chester

facilities. The amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for remediation costs of known PCB painted structures were
$1,000 and $2,935, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are recorded as other
operation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

In 2011, the Company installed a Continuous Emissions Monitor (“CEM”) to measure CO, NOx and

Opacity emissions from a furnace at our Chester facility in Pennsylvania. Since this time, the Company has
conducted Relative Accuracy Test Audits (“RATA”) as part of its efforts to certify the CEM. On May 5, 2014,
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“PADEP”) officially notified the Company that it was
certifying the CEM based on RATA test results dating back to November 2011 and to start entering data
previously recorded by the CEM into the Agency’s on-line database. During the third and fourth quarters of
2014, the Company officially entered data recorded from the CEM up until the second quarter of 2013. On
January 8, 2015, the Environmental Program Manager for the Southeast Regional Office Air Quality Program of
PADEP notified the Company that it would like to meet to discuss penalty calculations associated with CO and
NOx emissions based on the CEM data. The penalty amount starting with fourth quarter 2011 through the second
quarter 2013 indicated in PADEP’s communication to the Company totals to $1,489. The Company is planning
to meet with PADEP to propose significant reductions in the penalty amounts cited by the Agency. As of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has recorded a reserve of $1,700 and $1,489, respectively, associated
with the PADEP penalty and is recorded as other operation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

As part of the 2008 INEOS Silicas Acquisition, the Company acquired a manufacturing facility at

Warrington, United Kingdom. Asbestos-containing building material is present at the site, and asbestos removal
and insulation replacement initiatives are underway. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has
recorded a reserve of $639 and $671, respectively, for costs related to this program.

In 2008, the Company sold the property of a manufacturing facility located in the United States to the local

port authority. In 2009, the port authority commissioned an environmental investigation of portions of the
property. In 2010, the port authority advised the Company of alleged soil and groundwater contamination on the
property and alleged the Company liable for certain conditions. The Company received and reviewed the
environmental investigation documentation and determined it may have liability with respect to some, but not all,
of the alleged contamination. Respective legal counsel for the Company and the Port of Tacoma are currently
engaged in efforts to negotiate the terms of a cost sharing agreement for the funding of additional study and
subsequent abatement work to the extent necessary for the site. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the
Company has recorded a reserve of $707 and $728, respectively, for costs related to this potential liability.

As part of the 2008 INEOS Silicas Acquisition, the Company is liable for potential multi-year UK tax

benefits. The Company is contractually obligated to make a payment on an annual basis on its UK taxable
results, which can fluctuate period to period, until there is a change in control, as defined in the purchase
agreement. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has accrued $5,385 and $6,457, respectively, for
this matter representing the expected payment owed on the calculation of the liability for the tax year ended 2015
and 2014. The Company recorded these expenses as transaction related costs in other operating expense, net.

The Company has entered into various lease agreements for the rental of office and plant facilities and

equipment, substantially all of which are classified as operating leases. Total rent expense under these
agreements was $14,551, $13,476, and $10,939, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013,
respectively.

The Company rents its corporate office under a long-term operating lease agreement, which contains a

provision for a mid-term rent increase. The Company records monthly rent expense equal to the total of the
payments due over the lease term, divided by the number of months of the lease term. The difference between
rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent liability, which is reflected in
the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company has entered into short and long-term purchase commitments for various key raw materials

and energy requirements. The purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods that are enforceable
and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. The purchase commitments covered by these
agreements are with various suppliers and total approximately $13,031.

Purchases under these agreements are expected to be:

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the

**Auditor’s Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We

conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the

consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

**1. Organization and Nature of Operations**

On July 30, 2014, Eco Services Operations LLC, (“Eco Services” or the “Company”) a Delaware limited

liability company and an indirect subsidiary of funds advised by CCMP Capital Advisors LLC (“CCMP”)
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Solvay USA Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Solvay” ), which
provided for the sale, transfer and assignment by Solvay, and the acquisition, acceptance and assumption by Eco
Services, of substantially all of the assets of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit for sulfuric acid virgin
production and regeneration business operations in the United States (the “Acquisition”), which constitutes Eco
Services going forward. The Acquisition closed on December 1, 2014. The purchase price for the Eco Services
business was $890,000 in cash, subject to adjustment for certain items, including the actual level of working
capital at the closing of the Acquisition ( refer to Note 5, “Acquisition”). The Company is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Eco Services Intermediate Holdings LLC (“Intermediate Holdings”). The Company serves a variety
of markets, including the oil refining, nylon, mining, general industrial and chemical industries. Eco Services
operates a network of acid plants at six locations.

Prior to the Acquisition, Eco Services operated within Solvay, which is an indirect, wholly owned

subsidiary of Solvay SA, an international industrial group active in chemistry headquartered in Brussels,
Belgium.

On August 18, 2015, the Company announced that Eco Services Group Holdings LLC (“Holdings”), PQ

Corporation and certain of their respective affiliates had signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which PQ
Corporation and Holdings will reorganize under a newly formed holding company (the “Combined Company”).
The Combined Company will retain the PQ Corporation name. PQ Corporation is a global provider of specialty
inorganic performance chemicals, high-end catalysts and engineered glass beads.

PQ Corporation’s existing indirect shareholders (affiliates of CCMP, affiliates of INEOS Capital Partners

and PQ Corporation’s management) and Holdings existing indirect equity holders (affiliates of CCMP and
management) will constitute the sole shareholders of the Combined Company immediately following the closing
of the business combination. The business combination will not constitute a change in control under the
Company’s existing Senior Credit Agreement and existing Senior Notes, as CCMP will control the majority of
the outstanding equity of the Combined Company after the transactions. The completion of the transactions is
subject to certain closing conditions that are customary for transactions of this type, including regulatory
clearance.

**2. Basis of Presentation**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles

generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All dollar amounts presented herein are in
thousands.

On December 1, 2014, the Company acquired substantially all of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit. The

Company applied the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805—“Business Combinations”. The consolidated
financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to
December 31, 2014 reflect the financial results and financial position of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Eco Finance Corp. on a stand-alone basis (the “Successor Financial Statements”).

The financial statements prior to the acquisition of Solvay’s Eco Service business unit reflect the financial

results and financial position based upon the historical cost basis of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit, and

**ECO SERVICES OPERATIONS LLC (A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ECO SERVICES**

**INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS LLC)**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

include amounts that have been “carved out” from the Solvay’s financial statements using assumptions and
allocations made by Solvay to depict Solvay’s Eco Services business unit on a stand-alone basis (the
“Predecessor Financial Statements”). As a result, the Predecessor Financial Statements included herein may not
necessarily be indicative of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit results of operations or cash flows had Solvay’s
Eco Services business unit operated solely as a stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

The Predecessor Financial Statements were prepared using the historical basis of the assets and liabilities of

Solvay’s Eco Services business unit and include all sales, costs, assets and liabilities directly attributable to
Solvay’s Eco Services business unit. In addition, certain expenses reflected in these Predecessor Financial
Statements are based on allocations of corporate expenses from Solvay using methodologies that in the opinion
of management are reasonable and consistently applied (refer to Note 14 “Relationship with Solvay”). All such
expenses are deemed to have been paid by Solvay’s Eco Services business unit to Solvay in the period in which
the expenses were incurred. Net changes in Parent company investment in Solvay’s Eco Services business unit as
shown in the statements of Member’s Equity / Parent company investment and of cash flow for December 31,
2013 include amounts due to / from Solvay that are not regularly settled and, therefore, resemble investment of
such amounts by Solvay.

Solvay used a centralized approach to cash management and financing the operations of Solvay’s Eco

Services business unit as needed. Transactions between Solvay and Solvay’s Eco Services business unit were
accounted for through Parent company investment. Accordingly, none of the cash, cash equivalents, debt or
related interest expense at the Solvay level in the Predecessor Financial Statements has been assigned to Solvay’s
Eco Services business unit with the exception of capital lease obligations and related interest expense that
specifically relate to Solvay’s Eco Services business unit.

**3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

**_New Standards, Interpretations and Amendments_**

Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates

(“ASU’s”) to the FASB’s ASC. Management considers the applicability and impact of all ASU’s. ASU’s not
listed were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the
financial position or results of operations.

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for leases. Under the new

guidance, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for most leases but will recognize expenses similar to
current lease accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a
modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which provides

guidance for revenue recognition. The standard’s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue
when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional
disclosures. These new requirements for nonpublic entities become effective for annual reporting periods

beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
A nonpublic entity may elect early application, but no earlier than December 15, 2017, the effective date for
public entities. The Company is assessing the impact of these new requirements on its financial statements.

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating

_the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Under this ASU, an entity will no longer be allowed to separately disclose_
extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or
transaction is unusual in nature and occurs infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted
ASU 2015-01 effective December 31, 2015. The adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory”. The standard

requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation. These amendments do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first out
or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is
measured using first-in, first-out or average cost. The requirements of this standard are effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its financial statements.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, “Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt

_Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements”. As described above, the FASB issued ASU 2015-_
03, which does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-ofcredit arrangements. ASU 2015-15 adds Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”) paragraphs pursuant to the
SEC Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) meeting. Given the absence
of authoritative guidance within Update 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements,
ASU 2015-15 adds language from the EITF that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and
presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably
over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on
the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company has adopted the requirements of this standard as described above.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period

_Adjustments”. The standard will change the requirements for reporting measurement period adjustments to_
provisional amounts initially recognized in conjunction with a business combination. Under U.S. GAAP, an
acquiring entity currently is required to retrospectively adjust, in prior period financial statements, the
provisional amounts to reflect new information obtained during the measurement period (a period, which may
not exceed one year from the date of the business combination, during which the acquiring entity may receive
information about the facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have
affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date). Under the new guidance,
adjustments to the provisional amounts will be reflected in the financial statements for the reporting period in
which the adjustments are determined, including by recognizing in current period earnings the full effect of
changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects. The guidance requires that the acquiring entity
either present separately on the face of the current period income statement or disclose in the notes to the current
period financial statement, by line item, the amount of the adjustments made during the current period. The new
guidance for nonpublic entities will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively

to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance with earlier application
permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company has elected
to adopt the requirements of this standard as of December 31, 2015.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in

the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts. The more significant estimates include fair value estimates for the application of acquisition accounting
(Successor Financial Statements only), allocations of expenses from Solvay (Predecessor Financial Statements
only), impairment analyses, inventory reserves, environmental reserves, and certain accrued expenses (Successor
and Predecessor financial statements). Actual amounts may differ from these amounts.

**_Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts_**

Receivables are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts

receivable reflects the best estimate of losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio determined on the
basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence.
Accounts receivable are written off when management determines they are uncollectible.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the basis of the weighted

average cost method. Finished products are measured at the cost of production which includes, in addition to the
cost of raw materials, the costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition and an
allocation of overhead costs, excluding administrative overhead costs.

**_Property, Plant and Equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and

improvements are capitalized. The Company capitalizes costs associated with the implementation of purchased
software. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated
depreciation of all property, plant and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations. Depreciation is calculated on the
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally ranging from nine to twenty-two
years for buildings and improvements, and three to twenty years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever
is shorter.

**_Spare Parts_**

Spare parts are maintained by each facility to keep machinery and equipment in working order. Spare parts

are capitalized and included in other long-term assets. Those spare parts are measured at cost and are not
depreciated or expensed until utilized; however, reserves may be provided on aged spare parts. When a spare part
is utilized as part of an improvement to property, plant and equipment, the carrying value is depreciated over the
applicable life once placed in service. Otherwise, the spare part is expensed and charged as a cost of production
when utilized.

**_Goodwill_**

The following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s goodwill:

On December 1, 2014, the Company acquired substantially all of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit and

accounted for the acquisition in accordance with ASC 805. Under the purchase method of accounting, the
acquired assets were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The purchase price was
allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values. The purchase
price allocation, which is based on the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, resulted in the Company
recording goodwill of $311,892. The Company believes that expected synergies of the acquisition is the primary
reason that contributed to a total purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill.

The Company has historically assessed the impairment of goodwill and the tradename indefinite-lived

intangible asset on an annual basis at December 31, and also at any other date when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that book value may exceed fair value. The estimate of fair value is highly subjective and
requires significant judgment related to, among other things, the estimate of the magnitude and timing of future
cash flows. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company voluntarily changed its annual
impairment assessment date to October 1, for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset. The change was
made to more closely align the impairment testing date with its strategic planning process, preparation of its
long-term financial budget and cash flow projections and to ensure annual testing occurs within one year of the
December 1, 2014 Acquisition.

The Company’s management believes that this change in measurement date, which represents a change in

method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable under the circumstances, and did not result in the delay,
acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge. The Company prospectively applied the change to the annual
impairment assessment date beginning October 1, 2015, as there was no impairment assessment performed as of
December 31, 2014, as the Acquisition occurred December 1, 2014. As a result of the impairment testing
completed as of October 1, 2015, management has determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or
indefinite-lived intangible asset.

**_Intangible Assets_**

Intangible assets are carried at cost in the balance sheet, less accumulated amortization if applicable. Major

intangible assets include customer relationships, developed technology and trade name (refer to Note 10,
“Intangible assets, net”), as well as environmental permits. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized using
the straight-line method over their expected period of use. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at
least once a year, or more frequently if factors change that could impact the life of the underlying assets. In the
Successor Financial Statements, the estimated useful lives for customer lists, developed technology and permits,
is fifteen years, fourteen years and five years, respectively. In the Predecessor Financial Statements, the
estimated useful life for both the customer relationship and developed technology intangible assets is fifteen
years. The estimated useful lives range five to ten years for environmental permits.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

Definite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events indicate a possible loss. Such

an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible asset.
If the assessment indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the recorded value of the intangible asset,
the carrying amount of the intangible asset is reduced by the estimated cash-flow shortfall on a discounted basis,
and a corresponding loss is recorded. There were no intangible asset impairments recorded during the periods
presented.

**_Impairment of Other Long-Lived Assets_**

Other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount

of the assets may not be fully recoverable by performing undiscounted operating cash flow analyses. When
testing assets for impairment, assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are
separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on fair value. There
were no other long-lived assets impairments recorded during the periods presented.

**_Debt Issuance Costs_**

Concurrent with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Company entered into a $500,000 senior seven

year term loan facility and $55,000 five year revolving credit facility (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”), and
also issued $200,000 in aggregate senior unsecured notes (the “Senior Notes”). In connection with the issuance
of this debt, the Company incurred debt issuance costs associated with the senior secured term loan, revolving
credit facility and senior unsecured notes, respectively. The Company has reported the debt issuance costs in the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related debt for both the term loan facility and the
senior unsecured notes. The unamortized debt issuance costs related to the unused revolving credit facility are
presented in other noncurrent assets.

Accretion/amortization of the debt issuance costs are reported as interest expense. Debt issuance costs

related to the senior secured term loan and senior notes are accreted under the effective interest method over the
term of the respective debt. The debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the term of this facility.

**_Insurance/Self-Insurance_**

Certain risks where permitted by law or regulation, including employee related benefits and workers’

compensation are self-insured. In the Successor Financial Statements liabilities associated with these risks are
estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial
assumptions. Liabilities associated with employee related benefits and workers’ compensation in the Predecessor
Financial Statements were allocated from Solvay based on Solvay’s Eco Services business unit’s headcount and
the dollar value of historical claims incurred, respectively.

**_Derivative Liabilities_**

A derivative liability has been identified which is related to the interest rate adjustment features of the senior

secured credit facilities and senior unsecured notes. For derivative instruments that are accounted for as
liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting
date, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. This derivative liability has been
evaluated and the value of this derivative liability was determined to be de minimus because the probability of an

F-68

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

interest rate adjustment to the Libor interest rate occurring due to a change in reserve requirements as a function
of Federal Reserve policy is very low. Although management does not expect the reserve rate to change in the
foreseeable future, management will continue to monitor reserve requirements that could result in the embedded
derivative having value. Derivative instrument liabilities, if any, are classified in the consolidated balance sheets
as current or non-current based on whether or not the net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be
required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.

**_Environmental Liabilities_**

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive and changing federal and state environmental laws and

regulations. Certain manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial use. As is typical in the specialty
chemicals business, soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past at certain sites and might occur
or be discovered in the future at other sites. Investigation and remediation or monitoring soil and groundwater
contamination is currently in process at certain of these sites. In addition, the Company is currently involved as a
potentially responsible party under federal and state statutes requiring remediation resulting from past waste
disposal practices at certain sites, including inactive sites. Currently, the Company is participating in
environmental assessments, remedial investigations/feasibility studies and remediation efforts at these and other
sites that may involve additional environmental costs in the future.

Periodic analyses are performed for environmental risks and the corresponding provisions. The provisions

are measured to the best of management’s knowledge and applicable regulations, the nature and extent of the
contamination, clean up techniques and other available information.

The accrual for environmental liabilities was $4,791 and $5,111 at December 31, 2015 and 2014,

respectively, of which $2,934 and $4,783 were included in noncurrent liabilities, respectively. Environmental
liabilities are estimated to be paid out through 2043. The impact of changes to estimated future cash flows is
recognized in the provision for environmental reserve in the statement of income.

Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the discovery of new

remedial sites, discovery of new information and scarcity of reliable information pertaining to certain sites,
improvements in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations, numerous possible remedial
techniques and solutions, difficulty in assessing the involvement of and the financial capability of other
potentially responsible parties (including insurers and other indemnities) and the extended time periods over
which remediation occurs. As the environmental contingencies are more clearly determined, it is reasonably
possible that amounts in excess of those amounts already accrued may be necessary and may be material.

Additionally, there is a state mandate to remediate ground soil at one operating site in the event this site is

shut down. There are no plans to sell, shut down or otherwise dispose of this site. Therefore, there is an
indeterminate settlement date for this potential obligation because the range of time over which it may settle is
unknown. Accordingly, a reasonable estimate of the fair value of this potential obligation cannot be made and, as
such, an accrual has not been made.

**_Contingencies_**

There may be legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Accruals are

recorded for contingencies to the extent that their occurrence is probable and that the related liabilities are
estimable. Anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts are only recorded when assured of recovery.

Many factors are considered in making these assessments, including the progress of the case, opinions or views
of legal counsel, prior case law, historical experience or other companies in similar cases, and deemed intent on
how to respond. Because litigation and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do
occur, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions. Legal costs are accrued in advance of when they are incurred when such costs are
considered probable and estimable.

There is various litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, which include claims for compensation

for civil responsibility for chemical products produced. Based on facts currently available and discussion with
counsel, management is of the opinion that the disposition of these matters will not materially affect the results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are

shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of the agreement, title and risk of loss have been
transferred, collectability is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.

The Predecessor Financial Statements included deferred revenue related to environmental abatement

arrangements. In connection with the Acquisition, the Company concluded there was no remaining service
requirements to be performed under these former environmental abatement arrangements. As such, no deferred
revenue liability was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation included in the Successor Financial
Statements.

**_Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs_**

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are included in revenues. The related shipping

and handling fees and costs incurred are included in cost of sales in the statements of operations.

**_Research and Development_**

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include employee related costs,

facility costs and certain outsourced research and development costs. There were no significant research and
development costs incurred during the periods presented.

**_Advertising Costs_**

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. There were no significant advertising costs incurred during the

period presented.

**_Employee Benefits_**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company assumed the liabilities related to employees who

participate in defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans (the “Plans”) previously
sponsored by Solvay. These Plans are accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for defined benefit
pension and other post-employment plans, and the total cost of the Plans is determined annually by actuarial
valuation. (Refer to Note 15 “Benefit plans”).

**_Share-Based Payments_**

**_Successor_**

Holdings, the ultimate parent of the Company, granted a total of 25,786 Class B Units (the “Grant Units”) to

certain employees, directors and affiliates of the Company at an exercise price of $1 per Grant Unit. Of this
amount, 14,419 and 11,367 Grant Units were granted on January 13, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
25,093 Grant Units were outstanding as of December 31, 2015.

Of this total, 10,674 Grant Units granted to employees have two vesting criteria, in which 50% are subject to

time-based vesting criteria and 50% are subject to performance-based criteria. The time-based Grant Units vest in
four equal annual installments on December 1, 2015, December 1, 2016, December 1, 2017, and December 1,
2018. 14,419 Grant Units to directors and affiliates are subject to time-based vesting criteria only, and vest in
four equal annual installments on December 1, 2015, December 1, 2016, December 1, 2017, and December 1,
2018. All of the Grant Units and were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the fair value of
a Grant Unit was $0.448. The key assumptions used in valuing the Grant Units were as follows: expected life of
seven years, expected volatility of 40.27%, risk-free interest rate of 2.02%, and 0.00% annual dividend yield.
Activity of nonvested Class B Units granted is shown below, and the weighted average grant-date fair value of
the Class B Units granted during 2015 was $0.448.

For the year ended December 31, 2015 compensation expense of $2,256, was recorded for the Grant Units.

There was no compensation expense recorded for the time-based Grant Units for the period from inception
(July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014 as such amount was not significant. Unrecognized compensation expense
related to these time-based Grant Units was approximately $6,750 and is expected to be recognized over the next
three years. The performance-based Grant Units only vest when specific liquidity events occur. As of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, the performance-based criteria of the Grant Units was deemed not probable, thus
no expense for the performance-based Grant Units has been recorded.

**_Predecessor_**

Historically, Solvay maintained various share-based compensation plans for employees during the historical

period. Employees participated in these share-based payment plans. Upon the acquisition of Solvay’s Eco
Services business unit, all existing Solvay awards were terminated. Accordingly, no further compensation or
termination expense was provided in the Successor Financial Statements.

In the Predecessor Financial Statements, this compensation expense was recognized on a straight-line basis

in the statements of operations over the vesting periods relating to these awards. Share-based payment expense
recognized for the period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2013
was $535 and $681, respectively. For purposes of determining the fair value of stock option awards, Solvay used
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

**_Other Income_**

In 2013, $3,266 was recorded in other income related to reimbursement from a state government for

eminent domain.

**_Income Taxes_**

**_Successor_**

The Company is as a single member limited liability company (LLC), treated as a partnership for federal

and state income tax purposes. All income tax liabilities and/or benefits of the Company are passed through to
the member. As such, no recognition of federal or state income taxes for the Company have been provided for in
the Successor Financial Statements. Any uncertain tax position taken by the member is not an uncertain tax
position of the Company.

**_Predecessor_**

For the Predecessor Financial Statements, a provision for income taxes was determined using the asset and

liability approach. The income taxes have been prepared on a separate return basis as if Solvay’s Eco Services
business unit was a stand-alone entity. Historically, Solvay’s Eco Services business unit was included in tax
filings with other Solvay entities. The results from being included in the combined tax returns are included in
Parent company investment. The tax results as presented are not reflective of the results that would result in the
future or would have been generated on a stand-alone basis.

Predecessor Financial Statement deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur

when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes are adjusted for enacted
changes in tax rates and tax laws. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more
likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

**_Fair value of financial instruments_**

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, and establishes a framework for measuring fair value

in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to

measure fair value into the following three broad categories:

   - Level 1 inputs—Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.

   - Level 2 inputs—Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for

identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, observable inputs other than quoted
prices and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.

   - Level 3 inputs—Unobservable inputs reflecting the entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions

market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

An analysis is performed of all existing financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a

recurring basis to determine the significance and character of all inputs used to determine their fair value.
Financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, have net carrying
values that approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

The estimated fair value of capital lease obligations, which fall in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is

based on estimated borrowing rates to discount the cash flows to their present value as provided by a broker, or
otherwise, quoted, current market prices for same or similar issues. Based on the present value of the cash flows
at estimated borrowing rates, the carrying value of the capital leases approximate their fair values.

**5. Acquisition**

**_Asset Purchase Agreement_**

On July 30, 2014, the Company entered into the Acquisition with Solvay, which provided for the sale,

transfer and assignment by Solvay, and the acquisition, acceptance and assumption by Eco Services, of
substantially all of the assets of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit, which will constitute the Eco Services
business going forward. The Acquisition closed on December 1, 2014 (the “Closing Date”).

The purchase price for Eco Services was $890,000 in cash, subject to adjustment for certain items, including

the actual level of working capital at the closing of the Acquisition, and a defined contribution plan adjustment.
The working capital and defined contribution plan adjustments to the purchase price resulted in a reduction to the
purchase price by $8,525 to $881,475 and were settled with Solvay as of June 30, 2015. The cash purchase price
paid for Eco Services was $885,440 at December 1, 2014. Acquisition costs of $14,666 are included in selling,
general and administrative expense in the Successor financial statements.

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

The Acquisition and related transactions were funded with the proceeds of the following transactions:

**_Senior Secured Credit Facilities_**

Concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Company entered into the Senior Secured

Credit Facilities, which includes a $500,000 seven year term loan facility, all of which was drawn on the Closing
Date, and a $55,000 five year revolving credit facility. See Note 6, “Senior Secured Credit Facilities,” for a more
detailed description of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

**_Senior Notes_**

The Company issued $200,000 in aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes. See Note 7, “Senior

Notes”, for a more detailed description of the senior unsecured notes issued.

**_Equity Investment_**

In connection with the Acquisition, affiliates of CCMP contributed $230,000 in cash and members of the

Company’s board of managers and management contributed $9,885 in cash. These funds were invested directly
or indirectly in Holdings. Holdings contributed the proceeds to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Intermediate
Holdings. Intermediate Holdings, in turn, contributed the proceeds to its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Company.

In order to apply the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets of

Eco Services based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over
the fair values of these net assets was recorded as goodwill as indicated in the table below. Under ASU 2015-16,
the Company has reported certain measurement period adjustments to previous provisional amounts in the
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

The fair values of the customer contracts and customer relationships were estimated using a multi-period

excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. Under this method, an intangible asset’s fair value is
equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the
intangible asset over its remaining useful life. To calculate fair value, management used probability-weighted
cash flows discounted at rates considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with this type of
intangible asset. Management believes that the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market
participant assumptions. Cash flows were generally assumed to extend through the duration of customer
contracts, including renewal periods as estimated by management.

The fair values of the developed technology and permits were estimated using the replacement cost method

of the cost approach. For the developed technology, management derived estimated costs necessary to establish
current technologies and procedures were considered, including employee cost and time necessary to develop the
processes and procedures. For the permits, management estimated the necessary costs to obtain the applicable
permits.

The fair value of the tradename was estimated using a form of the income approach known as the relief
from-royalty method. The basic tenet of the relief-from-royalty method is that without ownership of the subject
intangible asset, the user of that intangible asset (i.e., Eco Services) would have to make a stream of royalty
payments to the owner of the intangible asset in return for the rights to use that asset. By owning or acquiring the
intangible asset, the user avoids these royalty payments. Thus, management derived the hypothetical royalty
income from the projected revenues of the business, and discounted these streams of cash flows at rates
considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with the subject intangible assets.

**6. Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

**_Senior Secured Credit Facilities_**

Concurrently with the Acquisition, the Company entered into a credit agreement governing a $555,000

senior secured credit facility, which includes a $500,000 term loan facility and a $55,000 revolving credit
facility, with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent, and certain financial institutions
as lenders (the “Senior Credit Agreement”). The full amount of the $500,000 term loan facility was drawn on the
Closing Date to finance a portion of the Acquisition, including working capital and/or purchase price adjustments
payable on the Closing Date and the payment of related fees, expenses and other costs of the transactions.

The term loan facility was issued at 99.5% of the principal amount, resulting in an original issue discount on

the term loan facility of $2,500, with the discount reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction to the face

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

amount of the term loan. The accretion of the original issue discount is reported as interest expense, and is
accreted under the effective interest method over the term of the loan. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding
balance on the term loan, net of unamortized original issue discount of $2,159 and unamortized debt issuance
costs of $12,655, is $480,186.

Proceeds from the revolving credit facility may be used to finance the Company’s working capital needs and

other general corporate purposes, including investments, restricted payments and any other purpose not
prohibited as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement. In 2015, the Company borrowed and repaid $12,000 under
the revolving credit facility, resulting in no outstanding credit balance on the revolving credit facility as of
December 31, 2015. There were no proceeds drawn from the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2014. The
unamortized debt issuance costs of $1,585 and $1,853 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to
the revolving credit facility are presented as a noncurrent asset.

A portion of the revolving credit facility not to exceed $25,000 is also available for the issuance of letters of

credit. As of December 31, 2015, the Company issued letters of credit totaling $13,270.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable

interest rate margin, plus, at the Company’s option, either (a) a base rate determined by the reference to the
highest of (1) the prime commercial lending rate publicly announced by the administrative agent as the “prime
rate” as in effect on such day, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) the LIBOR rate determined
by reference to the cost of funds for Eurodollar deposits for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00% or (b) a
LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the specified interest period,
as adjusted for certain statutory reserve requirements. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate on the Senior
Credit Agreement was 4.75%.

A commitment fee is charged on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility of

(a) 0.50% per annum if the senior secured net leverage ratio is greater than 3.75:1.00, (b) 0.375% if the senior
secured net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.75:1.00 but greater than 3.25:1.00 and (c) 0.25% per annum if
the senior secured net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.25:1.00. In addition, a fronting fee will be charged
on the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit equal to 0.125% per annum.

The Company recorded unused commitment fees and letter of credit fees totaling $656 for the year ended

December 31, 2015. These fees are included as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operation.

**_Mandatory Prepayments_**

The Senior Credit Agreement requires the Company to prepay, subject to certain exceptions, outstanding

term loans with: (1) 100% of net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt, other than the net cash proceeds of the
Senior Notes described in Note 7, “Senior Notes,” and certain other debt permitted under the Senior Credit
Agreement; (2) 100% of net cash proceeds above a threshold amount of certain asset sales, subject to
reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions; and (3) 50% (subject to step-downs to 25% and 0% based upon
senior secured net leverage ratio levels of 3.75:1.00 and 3.25:1.00, respectively) of the Company’s annual excess
cash flow.

The Senior Credit Agreement requires the Company to prepay outstanding loans and cash collateralize,

“backstop” or replace outstanding letters of credit if at any time the aggregate amount of outstanding loans,

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Agreement
exceeds the aggregate amount of revolving commitments then in effect, in an aggregate amount equal to such
excess.

**_Voluntary Repayment_**

The Company may voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the commitment amount and repay

outstanding loans under the Senior Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty other than
(a) customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR borrowings and (b) in the case of the New Term Loan
Facility, a 1.00% call protection premium applicable to certain “repricing transactions” occurring on or prior to
the date that is six months after the Closing Date.

**_Amortization and Final Maturity_**

All outstanding revolving loans under the Senior Credit Agreement are due and payable in full upon the

expiration of its seven-year term. In the case of the term loans, the Company is required to make scheduled
quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans made on the Closing Date,
or $1,250, with the balance due on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date of December 1, 2021.
Accordingly, $5,000 of principal payments have been made as of December 31, 2015.

Maturities under the Senior Credit Agreement are as follows:

**Total** **2016** **2017** **2018** **2019** **2020** **Thereafter**

Senior Secured Credit Facilities . . . . . . . . . $495,000 $5,000 $5,000 $5,000 $5,000 $5,000 $470,000

**_General_**

Under the Senior Credit Agreement, the Company may request increases to the term loan facility and/or

revolving credit facility and/or add one or more incremental revolving facilities or term loan facilities in an
aggregate principal amount not to exceed (w) $125,000, plus (x) in the case of any incremental facilities that
serve to effectively extend the maturity of the term loan facility and/or revolving credit facility, an amount equal
to the reductions in the term loan facility and/or revolving credit facility to be replaced thereby, plus (y) the
amount of certain voluntary prepayment of the term loans under the term loan facility and/or any incremental
term facility and/or any permanent reduction of the commitments under the revolving credit facility and/or any
incremental revolving facility, plus (z) an unlimited amount so long as (1) if such indebtedness is secured on a
pari passu basis with the Senior Credit Agreement, the Company is in compliance on a pro forma basis with a
senior secured net leverage ratio of no greater than 4.50:1.00, (2) if such indebtedness is secured by a lien that is
junior to the lien securing the Senior Credit Agreement, the Company is in compliance on a pro forma basis with
a secured net leverage ratio of no greater than 4.75:1.00 and (3) if such indebtedness is unsecured, the Company
is in compliance on a pro forma basis with a total net leverage ratio of 6.50:1.00. The existing lenders under the
Senior Credit Agreement will not be under any obligation to provide such additional commitments.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

All obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and certain

of the Company’s existing and future direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. All obligations
under the Senior Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain
exceptions, by substantially all of the Company’s assets and the assets of the guarantors, including: (1) a first

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

priority pledge of all of the Company’s capital stock directly held by Holdings and a first priority pledge of all of
the capital stock directly held by the Company and its subsidiary guarantors (which pledge, in the case of the
capital stock of any first-tier foreign subsidiary or any “disregarded” domestic subsidiary, will be limited to 65%
of the stock of such subsidiary); and (2) a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s and
the guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets.

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

The Senior Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things and

subject to certain exceptions, will restrict our ability and the ability of any subsidiaries to: incur additional
indebtedness, pay dividends on the Company’s capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire the Company’s
capital stock, make investments, acquisitions, loans and advances, create negative pledge or restrictions on the
payment of dividends or payment of other amounts owed to us from any subsidiaries, engage in transactions with
the Company’s affiliates, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Company assets, including capital stock of its
subsidiaries, materially alter the business conducted by Eco Services, modify certain material documents, change
the Company’s fiscal year, consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve, incur liens, and make prepayments of
subordinated or junior debt or the Senior Notes described in Note 7, “Senior Notes.”

Holdings shall also be subject to a “passive holding company” covenant under the Senior Credit Agreement.

In addition, if on the last day of any fiscal quarter the total amount of outstanding revolving loans and letters of
credit (other than (x) letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or otherwise backstopped and (y) letters
of credit issued to support obligations in respect of existing financial assurances in an amount to be provided in
the Senior Credit Agreement) is in excess of 35% of the total revolving commitments at that time, the Company
will be subject to a senior secured net leverage ratio test of 6.40:1.00.

The Senior Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative

covenants and reporting obligations. In addition, the lenders under the Senior Credit Agreement will be permitted
to accelerate the loans and terminate commitments thereunder or exercise other specified remedies available to
secured creditors upon the occurrence of certain events of default, subject to certain grace periods and
exceptions, which will include, among others, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties,
covenant defaults, cross-defaults to certain material indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy, certain events
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, material judgments and changes of
control.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all Senior Credit Agreement covenant

requirements.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a

current transaction. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the term loan was lower than book value by
$12,375. There was no significant difference between book value and fair value as of December 31, 2014, as the
term loan facility was issued on December 1, 2014. The fair value is classified as Level 1 based upon the fair
value hierarchy and is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities.

**7. Senior Notes**

**_General_**

The Company issued $200,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.500% Senior Notes due 2022 under an

indenture dated October 24, 2014 between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee.
The Notes were issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities
Act.

Interest on the Senior Notes accrues at the rate of 8.500% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in

arrears on each May 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2015. The Company will make each interest
payment to the holders of record of the Senior Notes at the close of business on the immediately preceding
April 15 and October 15. Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has
been paid with respect to the Senior Notes, or if no interest has been paid with respect to such Notes, from the
date of original issuance thereof. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months. The Notes mature on November 1, 2022.

The Senior Notes were issued at 100% of the principal amount. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding

balance on the Senior Notes, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $7,085, is $192,915.

The Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company, pari passu in right of payment to all

existing and future senior indebtedness (including the Senior Credit Agreement) of the Company, and effectively
subordinated to all secured indebtedness of the Company (including the Senior Credit Agreements) to the extent
of the value of the assets securing such senior indebtedness. The Senior Notes are senior in right of payment to
all subordinated indebtedness of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with
all Senior Note covenant requirements.

**_Redemption_**

The Company is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to

the Senior Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required under the Indenture to
offer to purchase Senior Notes if it undergoes a change in control or a sale of assets.

At any time prior to November 1, 2017, the Company may redeem all or a part of the Senior Notes, at its

option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Senior Notes redeemed plus an “applicable make-whole premium” as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but not including, the date of redemption.

On and after November 1, 2017, the Company may redeem the Notes, at its option, in whole at any time or

in part from time to time, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to
be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, beginning on November 1 of each of the
years indicated below:

aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, with the net cash proceeds
of certain equity offerings; provided that at least 50% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Senior
Notes originally issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such
redemption.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a

current transaction. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the Senior Notes was lower than book value by
$30,000. There was no significant difference between book value and fair value as of December 31, 2014, as the
Senior Notes were issued on December 1, 2014. The fair value is classified as Level 1 based upon the fair value
hierarchy and is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities.

with Aroma Performance, a Solvay business unit (“Aroma”), on July 28, 2014. The CSA pertains to Eco
Services’ Baton Rouge, LA site. In connection with the CSA, the Company has agreed to continue to provide

with Solvay’s Silica business unit (“Silica”) pursuant to which the Company has agreed to provide Silica with

accounts payable assumed by Eco Services, certain transfer taxes paid by Solvay on behalf of Eco Services and
settlement of defined contribution plan adjustments. This amount was settled and paid by Eco Services as of
June 30, 2015.

**_Predecessor Financial Statements_**

**_Allocation of general corporate and other expenses_**

The Predecessor Financial Statements include expense allocations for certain functions provided by Solvay

and Solvay SA including, but not limited to, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and
regulatory. These expenses have been allocated to Solvay’s Eco Services business unit on the basis of direct
usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of revenue or headcount. For the period from
January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2013, Solvay’s Eco Services business
unit was allocated $12,942 and $16,583, respectively, with such amounts included in selling, general and
administrative expenses within the statements of operations.

In addition, the Predecessor Financial Statements include expense allocations from Solvay for employee

benefit costs, including payroll taxes, group medical, dental and life insurance, post-employment and other
benefits. These costs have been allocated on the basis of total salary expense. For the period from January 1,
2014 to November 30, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2013, Solvay’s Eco Services business unit was
allocated $14,062 and $15,989, respectively, of employee benefit costs incurred by Solvay. For the period from
January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2013, Solvay’s Eco Services business
unit was allocated $565 and $570 of rent expense for shared facilities on the basis of sales.

**ECO SERVICES OPERATIONS LLC (A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ECO SERVICES**

**INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS LLC)**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

The expense allocations have been determined on a basis that management considers to be a reasonable

reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by Solvay’s Eco Services business unit
during the periods presented. The allocations may not, however, reflect the expense Solvay’s Eco Services
business unit would have incurred as an independent company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may
have been incurred if Solvay’s Eco Services business unit had been a stand-alone company would depend on a
number of factors, including the chosen organization structure, which functions were outsourced or performed by
employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure.

**_Related party transactions_**

Solvay’s Eco Services business unit sold product to two other Solvay business units, with revenue recorded

equivalent to cost incurred. These sales totaled $1,541 and $1,651, for the period from January 1, 2014 to
November 30, 2014, and for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Solvay’s Eco Services business
unit also provided hazardous waste removal services to one of these other Solvay business units at cost. Such
sales totaled $754 and $917 for the period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, and for the year ended
December 31, 2013.

Solvay’s Eco Services business unit also operated a facility that is shared with another Solvay business unit.

Solvay’s Eco Services business unit incurs certain shared costs, such as electricity, steam, other utility costs and
plant administration costs, all of which are charged to this other business unit primarily based on direct usage.
Solvay’s Eco Services business unit charged out $5,799 and $5,822 for such expenses, for the period from
January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively, with such amounts
included as a reduction to cost of sales in the statements of operations.

**_Parent company investment_**

Under the Predecessor Financial Statement presentation, which lacks an independent capital structure, it is

not meaningful to show share capital or retained earnings for Solvay’s Eco Services business unit. The net assets
are represented by the cumulative investment in Solvay’s Eco Services business unit by Solvay which is shown
as Parent company investment comprised of the accumulated earnings of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit and
net transfers to/from the Parent.

All significant intercompany transactions between Solvay’s Eco Services business unit and Solvay have

been included in the Predecessor Financial Statements and are considered to be effectively settled for cash at the
time the transaction is recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions is
reflected in the statements of cash flows as a financing activity as Parent company investment. Net transfers to/
from Solvay are deemed borrowings and repayments to Solvay associated with Solvay’s centralized treasury
function (for which bifurcation between gross borrowings and gross repayments is not practical). Accordingly,
such activity is deemed a net financing activity for cash flow presentation purposes.

**15. Benefit plans**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company assumed the liabilities related to employees who

participate in defined benefit plans previously sponsored by Solvay. These defined benefit plans include the Eco
Services Hourly Pension Plan (“Hourly Plan”), Eco Services Pension Equity Plan (“PEP Plan”), and Eco
Services Postretirement Life and Dental Plan (“PRM Plan”), (collectively, the “Plans”).

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

In accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, during 2015 the Company and Solvay completed its

review and concurred on of the calculation of the final accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”). Solvay paid the
required difference between the trust-to-trust plan asset transfer, and the final ABO of $14,936, through the
transfer of additional funds from its general assets to the Company’s general assets outside of the Plans. The
Company then transferred to the Company’s plan trusts an aggregate of $14,936 to settle its estimated liability
for the Plans.

The following tables summarize changes in the benefit obligation, the plan assets and the funded status of

our significant benefit plans as well as the components of net periodic benefit costs, including key assumptions as

The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking into consideration plan liabilities, U.S.

regulatory requirements, plan payment streams and then-current capital market assumptions. The actual asset
allocation for each plan is monitored at least quarterly, relative to the established policy targets and ranges. If the
actual asset allocation is close to or out of any of the ranges, a review is conducted. Rebalancing will occur
toward the target allocation, with due consideration given to the liquidity of the investments and transaction
costs.

The objectives of the Company’s investment strategies are as follows. All Plans’ assets are to be held and

invested for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries. The Company’s goal is to provide a
secure trust fund from which retirement benefits can be paid to employees, as described in the plans, and
consistent with prudent management. To meet these requirements, Company contributions to the defined-benefit
trust fund are invested with the primary objective of achieving a minimum annualized total return meeting or
exceeding the Plans’ current actuarial return assumption. The objectives are accomplished through an investment
strategy that includes both domestic and international equities along with fixed-income investments in a mix,
which is conducive to participation in rising markets while allowing for protection in falling markets. The target
asset allocation of the Hourly Plan assets is 52.40% in fixed income funds, 47.53% in equities, and 0.07% in
cash. The target asset allocation of the PEP Plan assets is 44.20% in fixed income funds, 55.72% in equities, and
0.08% in cash.

The Company categorized Plans’ assets into a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy consists of three levels as

follows:

   - Level 1—Values are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets

accessible at the measurement date. Active markets provide pricing data for trades occurring at least
weekly and include exchanges and dealer markets. Level 1 assets primarily include investments in publicly
traded equity securities and mutual funds. These securities (or the underlying investments of the funds) are
actively traded and valued using quoted prices for identical securities from the market exchanges.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(All dollar amounts are in thousands)**

   - Level 2—Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from

those willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by market data for the term of the instrument. Such inputs include market interest rates and
volatilities, spreads and yield curves. Level 2 assets primarily consist of fixed-income securities and
comingled funds that are not actively traded or whose underlying investments are valued using observable
marketplace inputs. The fair value of plan assets invested in fixed-income securities is generally
determined using valuation models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields, lowvolume market quotes and quoted prices for similar assets. Plan assets that are invested in comingled
funds are valued using a unit price or net asset value (“NAV”) that is based on the underlying investments
of the fund.

   - Level 3—Certain inputs are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the

fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what hypothetical
market participants would use to determine a transaction price for the asset or liability at the reporting
date. Level 3 assets include investments covered by insurance policies and real estate funds valued using
significant un-observable inputs.

contribution to the funds is provided. Defined contribution plan expense was $1,511, $85, $1,848, and $1,956 for
the year ended December 31, 2015, for the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014, for the
period January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, and for the year ended December 31, 2013.

**16. Concentrations of credit risk**

Concentration of credit risk relates to trade receivables which arise in the normal course of business.

Management performs regular credit evaluations of its customers.

Sales to one customer represented 13%, 10%, 12% and 13%, of total sales for the year ended December 31,

2015, the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014, the period January 1, 2014 to
November 30, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Sales to a second customer
represented 10%, 10%,11% and 11% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, the period from
inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014, the period January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, and the year
ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Sales to a third customer represented 10% of total sales for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

Trade receivables to one customer represented approximately 13% and 11% of total trade receivables at

December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Trade receivables to a second customer represented approximately
14% of total trade receivables at December 31, 2015. The Company does not believe these concentrations present
a significant credit risk.

**19. Long-term supply contract**

As part of Solvay’s 2004 sale of its Specialty Phosphates business, Solvay agreed to continue to supply

sulfuric acid to a third party in support of the phosphoric acid production for its specialty phosphates business
under a preexisting supply agreement. This non-cancelable agreement extends to 2031, and was assumed by the
Company in connection with the Acquisition. Actual losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015,
the period December 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, the period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, and
year ended December 31, 2013, (and included within gross profit) were $1,163, $0, $662 and $900, respectively.

The liability associated with this supply agreement was recorded at an estimated fair value of $27,300 at the

Acquisition date (as discussed in Note 5, “Acquisition”). The fair value was determined by appraisal, based on
the marked up price of the sulfuric acid over the price per the supply agreement, or mark up. The liability as of
December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $25,526 and $27,164, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 2015, this liability was reduced by $1,638 via a corresponding credit to cost of sales, which offsets
the aforementioned operating loss.
