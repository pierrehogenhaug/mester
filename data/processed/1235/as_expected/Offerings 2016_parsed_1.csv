In accordance with U.S. GAAP, this offering memorandum presents Eco as the accounting predecessor to New Holdings. Until the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Solvay’s Eco Services business unit by Eco (the “2014 Acquisition”), Eco historically operated as a business unit of Solvay USA Inc. (“Solvay”) and therefore, the financial statements of Eco contained in this offering memorandum for periods prior to the 2014 Acquisition are not necessarily indicative of what Eco’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been if Eco had been a separate, standalone entity that operated completely independently of Solvay. Additionally, in connection with the 2014 Acquisition, a new basis of accounting was established as of December 1, 2014 as a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting.

Some data and statistical information are also based on our good faith estimates, which are derived from management’s knowledge of our industry and such independent sources referred to above. Certain supply share statistics, ranking and industry data included in this offering memorandum, including the size of certain end-uses and our size or estimated position and the positions of our competitors for sales into such end-uses, including our services relative to our competitors, are based on estimates of our management. These estimates have been derived from our management’s knowledge and experience in the industries in which we operate, as well as information obtained from surveys, reports by research firms, our customers, distributors, suppliers, trade and business organizations and other contacts in the industries in which we operate. Unless otherwise noted, all of our supply share and supply position information presented in this offering memorandum is an approximation based on management’s knowledge.

1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in other public disclosures of “non-GAAP financial measures.” These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial measures are publicly presented and require, among other things: - a presentation of equal or greater prominence of the most directly comparable financial measure or measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP; - a quantitative reconciliation for historical non-GAAP measures presented and qualitative differences between non-GAAP financial measures disclosed with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP; vi ----- - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the registrant’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measure; and - a statement disclosing the reasons why the registrant’s management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding the registrant’s financial condition and results of operations. The rules prohibit in all filings with the SEC, among other things: - the exclusion of charges or liabilities that require, or will require, cash settlement or would have required cash settlement, absent an ability to settle in another manner, from a non-GAAP liquidity measure; - the adjustment of a non-GAAP financial measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it has occurred in the past two years or is reasonably likely to recur within the next two years, where such charge is specifically described as non-recurring; - the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of the registrant’s financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or in the accompanying notes; - the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of any pro forma financial information required to be disclosed by Article 11 of Regulation S-X; or - the use of titles or descriptions of non-GAAP financial measures that are the same as, or confusingly similar to, titles or descriptions used for GAAP financial measures. To supplement the financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use certain nonGAAP financial measures of PQ Holdings and Eco in this offering memorandum such as (i) “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Combined Adjusted EBITDA,” “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA” and “Business Adjusted EBITDA” (collectively, our “EBITDA Measures”) and (ii) “Free Cash Flow.” In addition, we present (i) “Contribution Margin” and (ii) “Fixed Costs” for Eco. We also present combined financial data for Eco for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2014. The combined financial data for Eco for the year ended December 31, 2011 is the combination of the predecessor period from January 1, 2011 to September 6, 2011 and the successor period from September 7, 2011 to December 31, 2011 for the Solvay acquisition from Rhodia of the Eco business. The combined financial data for Eco for the year ended December 31, 2014 is the combination of the predecessor period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014 and the successor period from inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014 for the CCMP acquisition from Solvay of the Eco business. We also present combined financial data for PQ as the combined results for PQ Holdings Inc. and the Eco Services Operations LLC. Our presentation of our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow, Contribution Margin and Fixed Costs may not comply with SEC rules governing the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. For example, some of the adjustments to our EBITDA Measures as presented in this offering memorandum may not be allowed under Regulation S-X. We have included our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow in this offering memorandum because our management believes that they provide useful information about our past operating performance. Our presentation of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with the definitions of EBITDA included in the indenture governing the Notes offered hereby, the New Senior Unsecured Notes and our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow are not measurements of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest, or principal payments, on our debt; vii ----- - they exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash availability to us; - although depreciation is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future, and our EBITDA Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, which includes maintenance capital expenditures; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using our EBITDA Measures and Free Cash Flow only for supplemental purposes. See our financial statements elsewhere in this offering memorandum for our GAAP results. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of PQ Holdings” and “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of Eco” for a description of the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA of each of PQ and Eco, Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation to net income (loss) and a description of Free Cash Flow. The adjustments that are used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA for PQ are not allocated to PQ’s operating businesses and, as a result, we are unable to reconcile Business Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure. Total Business Adjusted EBITDA differs from PQ’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA because it does not include the impact of unallocated corporate expenses as reflected in “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of PQ Holdings.” See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Eco—Description of Key Financial Statement Line Items” for a description of Contribution Margin and Fixed Costs. viii -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Further, our cost structure and strategically located manufacturing facility network is a key competitive strength as many of our products have a very limited economic shipping distance. We are a global player and we believe we have leading supply positions across our portfolio of products. We expect favorable industry and competitive conditions to continue as a result of the attractive, environmentally-friendly attributes of silicates, large investment required to build new production capacity, the lack of cost-effective substitute chemicals for sodium silicate and the low penetration of imported sodium silicate due to significant transportation costs and our short delivery cycle times.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

We believe these positions allow us to drive growth through continued innovation in our key products and have allowed us to outperform the industry, as a whole, in recessionary environments. - Attractive industry structure. We hold leading positions in attractive industries, with strategicallylocated, cost-effective plants and long-term customer relationships, which, in combination, provide favorable industry dynamics. Attractive underlying fundamentals including localized product demand and a competitive advantage have allowed us to maintain margins throughout business and economic cycles. In our Performance Chemicals and Specialty Glass Materials businesses, many of our competitors are local or regional players. We believe that we have distinct cost advantages versus our competitors in these businesses, and we benefit from our strategically located manufacturing facilities due to the high cost of transportation relative to silicate and glass materials prices. Our geographic footprint is closely aligned 8 ----- with our key customers, which we believe provides us with a strong competitive position. In Performance Chemicals, we believe that we also benefit from having manufacturing operations that target specific high margin niche products. In Specialty Glass materials, we contract on an annual basis, which allows for management of input costs and hedging of fuel needs. In our Catalysts business, we collaborate with our customers over many years to develop products that meet customized specifications and performance characteristics with strict quality and specification standards. In addition, we protect our technological and process innovations through our extensive portfolio of patents and through our trade secret protection program. While no one patent is crucial to our continued success, we believe our patent portfolio in the aggregate, combined with our extensive manufacturing network, reinforces our competitive advantage. In Eco, our regeneration business is highly integrated into our customers’ sulfuric acid regeneration and supply activities, in some cases via captive pipeline connections. A significant portion of Performance Chemicals North America and Eco revenue is protected through long term contracts, some of which are “take or pay,” with cost pass-throughs. Additionally, we believe that there are attractive macro fundamentals underpinning each of our four divisions. Performance Chemicals is aided by shifting customer preferences towards greener substitutes for personal care, household cleaning, and tire applications. Our Catalysts business is aided by the industrial buildout in petrochemicals and increased focus on emission control. Our Specialty Glass Materials business is aided by increasing highway safety regulations. We believe Eco is underpinned by growing sulfuric acid needs as a result of well-positioned North American refining customers and increased demand for high octane gasoline and increased alkylation from higher mix of tight/shale oil. - Attractive, stable margins with near term synergy and cost savings upside. We have demonstrated our ability to maintain stable margins while continuously growing the business organically in different macroeconomic environments. From 2008 through 2015, PQ’s Adjusted EBITDA margins and contribution margins (which refer to sales less variable costs excluding freight costs, divided by sales) averaged 22% and 55%, respectively, and did not vary significantly over that period. From 2008 through 2015, Eco’s Adjusted EBITDA margins and contribution margins averaged 22% and 66%, respectively, and did not vary significantly over that period. Unlike many chemical companies that use oil-based materials as a feedstock, our products rely on inorganic inputs, which makes us less sensitive to the volatility associated with oil-related commodity prices. In addition, we have long-term relationships with our key raw materials suppliers across our businesses and our customers and have been able to mitigate the impact of raw material or energy prices using a variety of mechanisms, including hedging on a monthly basis and pass-through on a quarterly basis or adjustment provisions in our sales contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 45% of our North American Performance Chemicals sales and approximately 91% of Eco Sulfuric Acid sales were derived from pass-through contracts. We have also been able to favorably negotiate other terms to compensate for material increases in key inputs. This combination of differentiated products and pass-through contracts has allowed us to sustain attractive margins. Moreover, exposure to defensive industries such as personal care, cleaning products, tires, and gasoline creates greater volume stability in downturns. We have identified $21.7 million in synergies and gross cost savings opportunities the majority of which are related to the integration of Eco Services into our operations. We believe that we maintain a differentiated level of stability in margins and cash flow in the specialty chemical sector. - Global and diverse end-uses. We serve a broad range of end-uses worldwide with no single end-use representing more than 18% of pro forma combined sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our Performance Chemicals, Catalysts and Specialty Glass Materials businesses benefit from global trends such as the growing global middle class, increased environmental regulations for emissions reduction and rising global energy consumption. Many of our largest end-uses, including transportation safety, laundry detergents, consumer cleaning, food and beverage and personal care, exhibit a low degree of cyclicality. The diversity of our remaining end-uses mitigates the impact of any one industry or regional cycle on our business. Our Eco business is benefitting from historically higher shale oil production in the United States 9 ----- and regulatory trends. Sulfuric acid serves as a key catalyst for refineries in the production of alkylate, which is considered to be the best blending component for gasoline because of its superior ability to boost octane and its low vapor pressure relative to substitutes such as ethanol and butane. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated approximately 68% of our pro forma combined sales in North America, 22% in Europe, 5% in Asia, 3% in South America and 2% in the rest of the world. In addition, we have benefited from the global trend toward more environmentally-friendly chemical solutions due to the inorganic nature of our products. The displacement of less environmentally-friendly chemicals in some applications will continue to drive higher growth rates as environmental concerns grow in magnitude and create opportunities for us to provide value-added solutions in these areas. - Long-term relationships with a diverse set of high-quality customers. We have cultivated a diversified and loyal base of customers, many of which are leading companies in their respective industries. Our customers include AkzoNobel, Albemarle, Anheuser-Busch InBev, BASF, Chevron, Colgate-Palmolive, Dow Chemical, Evonik, ExxonMobil, GlaxoSmithKline, Halliburton, Henkel, Honeywell, INEOS Group, Johnson Matthey, LyondellBasell, Procter & Gamble, Rio Tinto, SAB Miller, SABIC, Schlumberger, Sherwin-Williams, Umicore, Unilever, W. R. Grace and 3M. The average length of our relationships with our top 10 customers is over 50 years. Additionally, we have a diversified customer base, with our top 10 customers representing approximately 25% of pro forma combined sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 and no single customer representing more than 4% of pro forma combined sales for that period. We collaborate with our customers over many years to develop products that meet customized specifications and performance characteristics with strict quality standards. The long lead-time for product development—between five and ten years in some cases—provides an excellent opportunity for our company to build deep working relationships with customers. We believe our proximity to customers provides distinct cost advantages and a competitive advantage given the high cost of transportation relative to silicate and glass material prices. Given that our products provide critical performance functions in the end-products for which they are used, yet typically represent a very small portion of the overall cost of such end-products, our key customers depend on us for continual supply of our products over a prolonged period of time. - Proven ability to develop and commercialize new products. We leverage our state-of-the-art product development and commercialization platform to develop novel and highly customized products to meet evolving customer demand in the key regions around the world. We believe that our ability to collaborate closely with our customers to formulate innovative manufacturing and product solutions allows us to better serve them and is a key competitive advantage. For example, in our Performance Chemicals business, we have recently worked with our global European-based customers to optimize our manufacturing process to provide products for high whitening and desensitizing toothpaste applications that meet their particular specifications. We have also recently developed a new, environmentallyfriendly, magnesium-silicate product that allows restaurants to clean and recycle oil used for frying food. As a result of our new product development and commercialization efforts, we estimate that we generated over $173 million of pro forma combined sales in the year ended December 31, 2015 from products or applications that have been developed or commercialized in the last five years. Moreover, since 2009, sales margins have improved in more than 78% of our product lines. Overall, our product mix has become more focused on specialty, high-value added customer solutions. - Cash generative business model. Our business model is focused on high return capital projects with rapid payback periods. From 2011 through 2015, PQ invested $255 million of growth project capital with an estimated three- to four-year payback. During this period, PQ realized approximately $48 million of Adjusted EBITDA growth with additional projected Adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 and 2017 from these projects still to be realized with minimal spending. From 2011 to 2015, PQ invested $31 million on cost improvement projects with an estimated two- to three-year payback. From 2008 to 2009, PQ integrated INEOS Silicas and realized certain synergy benefits, increasing the margins for this business 10 ----- from 12.3% before its acquisition in 2007 to 21.3% after its acquisition in 2009. We believe the relatively fast payback period on these benefits positions us to be prepared during shifting marketing environments. PQ has tax attributes that mainly consist of $288 million in U.S. federal net operating losses, along with correlative state net operating losses, and $460 million identified intangibles and goodwill from the 2014 Acquisition, both of which will generate cash tax savings in future years. - Experienced management team. Our senior management team has substantial industry experience, proven capabilities and an average of over 30 years of experience in the performance chemicals, catalysts, specialty glass materials or sulfuric acid industries. Their industry experience extends to a broad range of facets of these industries, including acquisition integration, strategic management, manufacturing, sales and marketing, new product and applications development and financial management. Our management team was able to effectively guide PQ through the most recent recession by focusing on pricing actions, cost management, new product introductions and revising product offerings in order to shift towards more profitable and high growth end-uses. Our senior management team has a significant equity ownership interest in our company (approximately 10% of outstanding shares of New Holdings on a pro forma basis for the Business Combination).",N/A,as_expected,2016,361
1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Business Strategy,9.5.1,,"Our long-term success will be driven by our competitive strengths that will support our business strategy to continue to expand our product offering with higher margin innovative products. The key elements of our strategy are as follows: - Continue to focus our development efforts on high margin products. We intend to maintain our position as a leading, integrated producer of silicate and glass materials. We plan to do this, in part, by capitalizing on our technological leadership positions and our proven research and development competencies by developing new products, applications and end-uses for our silicate-based chemicals, specialty catalysts, engineered glass materials, and sulfuric acid platforms. Across our businesses, we have a proven track record of commercializing new products. This capability has diversified our product mix away from lower-margin, lower-growth products such as zeolites for detergent end-uses and into highermargin, higher-growth products such as magnesium silicate for frying oils, silica gels for coating applications and hollow glass spheres for emulsions for mining and auto body putty. For example, we have developed precipitated silica products for use in high whitening and desensitizing toothpaste and are developing new applications we hope to commercialize in the near future. We believe pursuing such opportunities will continue to result in profitable growth as we leverage our technological know-how and existing asset base developed from our core product lines. In addition, our new product development efforts are focused on applications with expected contribution margins greater than 50%. We have developed an industry-leading Catalysts business that has more than tripled its Adjusted EBITDA since 2005 and has achieved an average Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 37% over the same time period. This growth has been achieved through development of our proprietary technology, and we have made over $200 million in investments since 2005 to expand our manufacturing and technical capabilities and to increase capacity. In advance of committing to capital investments, we have been able to secure sole-source supply arrangements or have entered into long-term contracts with contracted volumes across both silica and specialty zeolite-based catalysts, and we expect our percentage of sales under long-term contracts to increase in the future. We expect to achieve high margins on sales from products related to these capital investments and to commit relatively low ongoing maintenance capital expenditures. We expect to achieve an approximately two-year payback, from the date those assets are placed in service, on the projects for which we have committed capital, and we expect to commit additional capital to serve newly contracted customers. 11 ----- As we continue to improve our technological advantage and our ability to serve our customers, we expect to continue to achieve high-return growth in this business line. Our products offer essential functional properties and are tailored to meet specific customer requirements, but represent a relatively low percentage of our customers’ manufacturing costs. We believe that our products help our customers to manufacture their products more cost-effectively and with better performance characteristics than competing technologies. For example, we believe our silica-based catalysts have continued to win opportunities in both new and existing polymerization and engineered plastics applications due to these characteristics. We believe that our specialty zeolite-based catalyst products and the end-uses they serve are well-aligned with several favorable global trends. The largest business in our specialty zeolite-based catalyst platform serves emissions control applications, particularly in the transportation industry, and we are strategically aligned with the top specialty zeolite-based catalysts producers in emissions control technologies. We believe the tightening of global emissions control standards has driven a reformulation of Heavy-Duty Diesel (“HDD”) engine catalysts, which relies on SCR, a zeolite-based catalytic process. In addition, we sell hydrocracking catalysts and Y-Powder zeolite material, which is a key component of critical hydrocracking catalysts; our joint venture partner, CRI Zeolites Inc. (a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc), is a leader in hydrocracking catalytic processes technology. Approximately 61% of the specialty zeolite-based catalyst sales during the year ended December 31, 2015 in these product lines were related to products that are protected by patents or sole-sourced. - Drive efficiency and cost savings. We intend to enhance our business processes and pursue cost savings opportunities available to us, especially in our Eco business. We will continue to pursue manufacturing efficiency gains through a number of initiatives already underway including lean manufacturing, investing in high return capital projects, and optimizing capacity to leverage our fixed cost base. We have identified $21.7 million in synergies and gross cost savings opportunities the majority of which are related to the integration of Eco Services into our operations. We may not realize these expected cost savings, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Business Combination—We may not realize the expected benefits of the Business Combination because of integration difficulties and other challenges” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Business Combination—We may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings or may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them.” - Focus on cash flow generation and debt reduction. We intend to continue to seek growth in our high margin products, while managing our costs and taking a disciplined approach to capital spending and working capital control. We have historically achieved cost savings through continuous improvement, yield enhancement, and energy improvement initiatives and expect to continue to do so. We have also invested capital and expect to continue to do so in order to achieve cost savings and support our existing high quality fixed assets and customers. We will also seek to grow our assets and customer base on a targeted basis to achieve compelling returns. We otherwise intend to use our excess cash flow to reduce our outstanding indebtedness. 12 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,2639,SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA,2639.1,,2639.1.1,,"The following tables set forth certain unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial and other data for the year ended December 31, 2015. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data set forth below should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of PQ Holdings,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of Eco,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of PQ Holdings,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Eco” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto of each of PQ Holdings and Eco, each of which is included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Eco is the accounting predecessor to New Holdings. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data presented below have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of PQ Holdings and Eco included elsewhere in this offering memorandum using the acquisition method of accounting and give effect to the Business Combination and the related financing transactions in each case, as if they had occurred on December 31, 2015 for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data and as of January 1, 2015 for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income, as more fully described in the assumptions and adjustments set forth under the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.” The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data is presented for informational purposes only, is based on currently available information and is not necessarily indicative of our financial position or results of operations that would have occurred had the pro forma transactions taken place on the applicable dates, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results. The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflecting the Business Combination and related refinancing transactions will be based upon the acquisition method of accounting and upon the assumptions set forth in the Notes included in this section and in “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.” The unaudited pro forma adjustments and allocation of the excess acquisition purchase price over the tangible and intangible net assets acquired to intangible assets and goodwill are preliminary and based on management’s best estimate of the fair value of intangible assets acquired relating to the Business Combination. The final purchase price allocation for the Business Combination is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of asset and liability valuations. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not completed the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the purchase price for the Business Combination. We have allocated the total estimated purchase price for the Business Combination, calculated as described in Note 1 under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of their fair values. In arriving at the estimated fair market values, we have considered many factors, including but not limited to, the appraisals by independent consultants which were based on a preliminary and limited review of the assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed. There are no assurances that the final estimate of fair market values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will not be materially different from the estimated fair market values thereof once a more detailed and thorough review of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is performed. The final valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets that exist as of the closing date of the Business Combination. Final adjustments relating to the Business Combination will change the allocations of purchase price, which will affect the fair value assigned to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed and will result in a change to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, including a change to goodwill. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. 20 ----- 21 ----- 22 ----- (f) Relates to restructuring and integration costs, including severance costs, costs associated with plant closings and consolidation, relocation or integration costs and other non-recurring business optimization and restructuring charges of approximately $4.5 million for PQ and approximately $4.1 million for Eco. (g) Reflects the gain/loss on any sale or disposal of long-lived assets. (h) Represents costs under a transition services agreement with Solvay which provides certain transition services to Eco by Solvay following the 2014 Acquisition. The transition services agreement ended in 2015. Certain services under this agreement will be incurred internally and reflected as an operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations. (i) Represents the Catalyst joint ventures depreciation, amortization and interest expense. (j) Relates primarily to environmental related costs of $2.0 million, defined benefit periodic pension costs of $6.1 million, other transaction gains of foreign currency in the income statement of $2.7 million and Sarbanes-Oxley preparation fees of $1.0 million as well as non-cash LIFO adjustment and expense, non-recurring legal-related costs, capital taxes, asset retirement obligation accretion and other expense. (k) Represents estimated identified run-rate synergies and cost savings opportunities, including (i) Eco overhead savings of $4.4 million resulting from consolidation synergies, insurance savings and SG&A savings, (ii) Eco manufacturing improvements of $8.1 million resulting from cost improvements, higher labor productivity and lower fixed freight costs and (iii) PQ cost reductions of $9.2 million resulting from ongoing fixed and variable cost programs and other programs already in progress or approved by PQ’s board of directors. (3) Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA margin is Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA divided by pro forma sales plus PQ Holdings’ proportionate share of the Catalyst Joint Venture sales. (4) Maintenance capital expenditures include spending on maintenance of business, cost savings initiatives and health, safety and environmental initiatives. Expansion capital expenditures include spending to drive organic sales growth. These capital expenditures represent “book” capital expenditures for which both PQ and Eco recorded, but not necessarily paid for the capital expenditures. (5) Free cash flow is defined as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures include spending on maintenance of business, cost savings initiatives and health, safety and environmental initiatives. (6) Pro forma cash interest expense is defined as the cash interest paid during the period on a pro forma basis and differs from interest expense in the income statement which includes amortization of deferred financing fees. Pro forma cash interest expense assumes a weighted average interest rate for the New Term Loan Facility, the New Senior Unsecured Notes, the existing Eco Notes and Notes offered hereby of approximately 8.2%. For every 0.125% change in the assumed weighted average interest rate for the New Term Loan Facility and the Notes offered hereby, assuming the New ABL Facility is undrawn, pro forma cash interest expense would increase or decrease, as applicable, by $2.3 million. (7) Ratio of pro forma net secured total debt to Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA represents our pro forma total debt that is secured by a lien other than $21 million of debt related to New Market Tax Credits described in “Description of Other Indebtedness” less our pro forma cash and cash equivalents divided by Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. (8) Ratio of pro forma net total debt to Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA represents our pro forma total debt other than $21 million of debt related to New Market Tax Credits less our pro forma cash and cash equivalents divided by Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. (9) Ratio of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma cash interest expense represents Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA divided by our pro forma cash interest expense. 23 ----- 24 ----- 25 ----- (i) Relates primarily to environmental remediation charges of $2.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, defined benefit periodic pension cost of $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, other transaction gains of foreign currency in the income statement of $2.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, Sarbanes-Oxley preparation fees of $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as non-recurring legal-related costs, capital taxes, asset retirement obligation accretion and other expense. (2) Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by PQ Holdings’ sales plus its proportionate share of the Catalyst Joint Venture sales. (3) Maintenance capital expenditures include spending on maintenance of business, cost savings initiatives and health, safety and environmental initiatives. Expansion capital expenditures include spending to drive organic sales growth. These capital expenditures represent PQ Holdings’ “book” capital expenditures for which it has recorded, but not necessarily paid for the capital expenditures. (4) Free cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures include spending on maintenance of business, cost savings initiatives and health, safety and environmental initiatives.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Currently, we operate 68 manufacturing facilities across six continents. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our foreign subsidiaries accounted for 39% of our sales on a pro forma combined basis. Our operations are affected directly and indirectly by global regulatory, economic and political conditions, including: - new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions; - export duties or import quotas; - domestic and foreign customs and tariffs or other trade barriers; - potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes; - managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations; - increased costs of, and availability of, raw materials, transportation or shipping; - credit risk and financial condition of local customers and distributors; - potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights; - risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments; - potential imposition of restrictions on investments; - the imposition of withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income, or the adoption of other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls; - capital controls; - potential difficulties in obtaining and enforcing legal judgments in jurisdictions outside the United States; - potential difficulties in obtaining and enforcing relief in the United States against parties located outside the United States; - difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables; - risks relating to environmental, health and safety matters; and - local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries. In addition, our facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could result in full or partial disruption of the activities of such facilities.

1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Combined Business,13.1.2,We are affected by general economic conditions and an economic downturn could adversely affect our operations and financial results.,"We sell performance chemicals that are used in manufacturing processes and as components of or ingredients in other products and, as a result, our sales are correlated with and affected by fluctuations in the level of industrial production and manufacturing output and general economic activity. Producers of performance chemicals, in particular, are likely to reduce their output in periods of significant contraction in industrial and consumer demand, while demand for the products we distribute often depends on trends in demand in the enduses our customers serve. Our profit margins, as well as overall demand for our products and services, could decline as a result of a large number of factors outside our control, including economic recessions, changes in industrial production processes or consumer preferences, changes in laws and regulations affecting the chemicals industry and the manner in which they are enforced, inflation, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of governments in the regions in which we operate. General economic conditions and macroeconomic trends, as well as the creditworthiness of our customers, could affect overall demand for products. Any overall decline in the demand for our products could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. If the creditworthiness of our customers declines, we would face increased credit risk. In addition, volatility and disruption in financial markets could adversely affect our sales and results of operations by limiting our customers’ ability to obtain financing necessary to maintain or expand their own operations.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361
1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Combined Business,13.1.3,Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.,"We incur currency transaction risk whenever we or one of our subsidiaries enter into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. In the past, we have experienced economic loss and a negative impact on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Any future fluctuations may have a similar or greater impact on our business since we expect that the amount of our sales denominated in non-dollar currencies may increase in future periods. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of PQ Holdings—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” As a result of our international operations, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated 39% of our sales on a pro forma combined basis and incurred a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To the extent we are unable to match sales made in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars, if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings. In addition, our debt service requirements are primarily in U.S. dollars even though a significant percentage of our cash flow is generated in foreign currencies. The main currencies to which we are exposed, besides the U.S. dollar, are the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. In many cases, we sell exclusively in those jurisdictions and do not have the ability to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations through external means. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows between financial periods.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361
1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Combined Business,13.1.4,"Our international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws, trade and export controls and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions in which we do business.","Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, 31 ----- individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anticorruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and the U.K. Bribery Act (“UKBA”). The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires us to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect our transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA and UKBA. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. In addition, we are subject to applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations imposed by the U.S. government and other countries. Changes in export controls or trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or regions or with sanctioned entities or individuals, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts, loss of export privileges as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. These policies and procedures are codified in our Code of Conduct and other various policies. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could subject us to governmental investigations and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Our customers may also pursue alternative technology that could eliminate the need for certain of our specialty chemicals, catalysts and engineered glass products. For example, over the last five years, customers in the detergent industry have significantly reduced their usage of zeolites. As a result, our sales of zeolite have declined from 16% of PQ’s sales in the year ended December 31, 2009 to 8% of PQ’s sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. The potential development and implementation of new technology could seriously impair our ability to profitably market some of our products if we are unable to respond appropriately to such new developments. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361
1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Combined Business,13.1.6,Our new product development and R&D efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products.,"The specialty chemicals, catalysts and engineered glass products industries are subject to periodic technological changes and ongoing product improvements. In order to maintain our margins and remain competitive, we must successfully develop, manufacture and market new or improved products. As a result, we must commit substantial resources each year to new product development and R&D. Ongoing investments in new product development and R&D for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues. Additionally, for any new product program, there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs. Moreover, new products may have lower margins than the products they replace. We also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products. As new products are introduced, our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products. If we fail to develop new products, maintain or improve our 32 ----- margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will suffer. In addition, there can be no assurance that new products will successfully attract end-users.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361
1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Combined Business,13.1.7,"If we are unable to pass on increases in raw material prices, including natural gas, or to retain or replace our key suppliers, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.","To produce chemicals and engineered glass products, we purchase significant amounts of raw materials, such as sodium carbonate, or soda ash, cullet, industrial sand, aluminum trihydrate, or ATH, sodium hydroxide (commonly known as caustic soda) and sulfur (including hydrogen sulfite), and purchase significant amounts of natural gas to supply the energy required in our production process. The cost of these raw materials, in the aggregate, represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Our results of operations have been and could in the future be significantly affected by increases in these costs. In addition, if any of the raw materials that we use become unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced, then we may not be able to obtain suitable and cost-effective substitutes. Any interruption of supply or any price increase of raw materials could adversely affect our profitability. We purchase certain of our North American soda ash requirements through long-term supply contracts and have historically been able to mitigate exposure to increases in pricing. As these contracts expire, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to renegotiate or enter into new supply contracts that will offer protection from pricing and other fluctuations or be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Other than with natural gas, we typically do not enter into any long-term forward contracts to hedge raw material price risks that we face. In the event of future price increases in soda ash or any of the other raw materials necessary to produce our basic chemicals, we may not be able to match raw material price increases with corresponding product price increases. Although in the past we have entered into long-term supply contracts for certain of our raw materials, we cannot provide assurance that in the future we will enter into such contracts or that any such contracts will be on favorable terms or will adequately protect us against increases in the costs of raw materials. While we attempt to match raw material price increases with corresponding product price increases, our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials to our customers is, to a large extent, dependent upon our contractual arrangements and market conditions. Additionally, changes in the price or availability of raw materials could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results. There may be periods of time during which we are not able to recover increases in the cost of raw materials due to our contractual arrangements or to weakness in demand for, or oversupply of, our products. Specifically, timing differences in pricing between raw material prices, which may change daily, and product prices, which in many cases are adjusted only quarterly or less often, sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates for increases, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on profitability. Even in periods during which raw material prices decline, we may suffer decreasing profits if raw material price reductions occur at a slower rate than decreases in the selling prices of our products. In addition, when raw material costs decrease, customers may seek relief in the form of lower sales prices. Furthermore, some of our customers in our Performance Chemicals business may take advantage of fluctuating prices by building inventories when they expect product prices to increase and reducing inventories when they expect product prices to decrease. Further, volatility in costs and pricing can result in commercial disputes with customers and suppliers with respect to interpretations of complex contractual arrangements. Significant adverse resolution of any such disputes could also reduce our profitability. We also obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from certain key suppliers. If any of these suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under current supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products. In addition, we purchase significant amounts of natural gas to supply the energy required in our production processes for our products. Historically, the cost of natural gas has fluctuated significantly, and our results of operations have been affected by these increases. We have attempted to mitigate our exposure to natural gas 33 ----- volatility by implementing a hedging program in the United States, and entering into forward purchases in the United States, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world; however, we cannot provide assurance that our hedging strategy will be successful. If energy prices rise, our profitability could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361
1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Combined Business,13.1.8,We face substantial competition in the industries in which we operate.,"Some of the industries in which we operate for the Performance Chemicals, Catalysts and Specialty Glass Materials businesses are highly competitive, and this competition could harm our business and our corresponding results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Sales dynamics in Europe and certain Asia-Pacific regions are particularly competitive due to the number of regional competitors. In the Catalysts business, we compete against large international producers as well. We believe that the most significant competitive factors for these products are quality, know-how and selling price. We could be subject to adverse results caused by our competitors’ pricing decisions. In addition, current and future consolidation among our competitors and customers may cause us to lose supply share as well as put downward pressure on pricing. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and/or may have less debt than we do. As a result, those competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the industries in which we compete and throughout the economy as a whole. As the demand for our products expands, we expect that existing competitors may commit more resources to the end-uses and geographies in which we participate. We may not be able to compete effectively in these various areas in the future and our competitive position and results of operations may suffer as a result. In the Performance Chemicals business, our competitors range from large international companies, such as OxyChem and W.R. Grace, to a large number of smaller regional companies of varying sizes. In the Catalysts business, our competitors include Clariant, Tosoh and W.R. Grace. In the Specialty Glass Materials business, our competitors include Sovitec and Swarco, among others. For the Eco business, we compete with multiple producers of U.S. sulfuric acid regeneration products and virgin sulfuric acid products. We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the industry are price, product quality and services. Some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than ours. In addition, some of our competitors’ financial, technological and other resources may be greater than ours and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions in the industry. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Further, consolidation of our competitors may make it more difficult for us to compete with them.

A loss of one or more customers could adversely impact our profitability.,"Our Eco business generates a significant portion of its net sales from a small number of customers. Our top 10 sulfuric acid regeneration customers represented approximately 97% of our overall acid regeneration sales and our top 10 virgin acid customers represented approximately 80% of our virgin acid sales for 2015. While many of these customers are under long term contracts with us, we cannot provide assurance that we will maintain our relationship with any particular customer or continue to provide services to any specific customers at current levels. In addition, at several of our facilities we are connected to a customer by a pipeline. In 2015, approximately 32% of our regenerated sulfuric acid volumes were shipped by captive pipelines. A loss of any significant customer, including a pipeline customer, or a decrease in the provision of services to any such customer could, in the short term, adversely affect our business until alternative arrangements are secured. Any alternative arrangement to replace a loss of a pipeline customer would result in increased variable costs relating to shipping our product. In addition, any new customer agreement entered into by us may not have terms as favorable as those contained in current customer agreements and the failure to obtain such favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, 34 ----- refineries have undergone significant consolidation and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation would increase our customers’ leverage over their suppliers, including us and could cause downward pressure on prices, which may adversely affect our profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Sulfuric acid regeneration customer contracts are typically on five to ten year terms. Our regeneration contracts with major refinery customers have contract termination notice periods of one to two years. Virgin sulfuric acid customer contracts are typically on one to five year terms, with larger customers favoring longer terms. Excluding contracts with automatic evergreen provisions, approximately 65% of 2015 sulfuric acid volumes were under contracts expiring at the end of 2018. While we have a strong re-contracting history, we cannot provide assurance that our existing contracts will not be subjected to early terminations or that our expiring contracts will be renewed at the end of their respective terms.

This seasonality is due to the fact that highway striping projects typically occur during warmer weather months. Our Eco business, which accounted for 24% of our sales on a pro forma combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2015, also typically experiences seasonal fluctuations as a result of oil refineries experiencing higher demand for gasoline products in the summer months. As a result, our working capital requirements tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarter and, accordingly, can adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow. Sales in our Performance Chemicals and Catalysts businesses, which accounted for 57% of our sales on a pro forma combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflect the general cyclical patterns of the industries for the end-users of our chemical and catalysts products. Sales of certain of our products, including a substantial portion of our Performance Chemicals and Catalysts businesses, are dependent upon the continued demand from a number of key customers.

The process of seeking approvals can be costly, time-consuming and subject to unanticipated and significant delays. Any delay in obtaining, or any failure to obtain or maintain, these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to generate sales from those products, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our products, including the raw materials we handle, are subject to rigorous chemical registration and industrial hygiene regulations and investigation. There is a risk that a key raw material, chemical or substance or one of the end products of which our products are a part may be recharacterized as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees. Industrial hygiene regulations are continually strengthened and if such recharacterization occurred, the relevant raw material, chemical or product may be banned or we may incur increased costs in order to comply with new requirements. Changes in industrial hygiene regulations also affect the marketability of certain of our products, and future regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our business. New laws and regulations, and changes in existing laws and regulations, may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs, seizures, confiscation, recall or monetary fines, any of which could 36 ----- prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our products.

We also are subject to other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding chemical and product safety as well as employee health and safety matters, including process safety requirements. These laws and regulations may become more stringent over time and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in significant fines or penalties. For instance, in November 2015, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“PADEP”) issued a $1.7 million fine associated with alleged air emissions violations related to excessive short term emissions of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, and excessive long term 12-month rolling sums of the two pollutants, at our Chester, PA, site. We have appealed alleged violation and associated fine. We also remain subject to a 2007 Consent Decree that resolves certain alleged Clean Air Act violations at our seven Eco operating locations involving New Source Review (“NSR”), Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), and New Source Performance Standard (“NSPS”) obligations under the federal rules for the pollutants sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid mist. The Consent Decree required Solvay (the owner at the time) to pay a $2 million penalty and spend approximately $34 million on air pollution controls at our facilities, the majority of which was received from customers in contractual arrangements. Work under the Consent Decree has proceeded since 2007, and, we believe that all of the significant capital improvements related to the Consent Decree have been completed. One of our operating locations has been released from the scope of the Consent Decree and we are seeking release of the other locations covered by the Consent Decree. Finally, these laws and regulations require us to obtain environmental registrations, licenses, permits, and other approvals in order to operate and can require us to install expensive pollution control equipment at our facilities or incur other capital expenditures aimed at achieving or maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations. Due to the Business Combination, many of the business’ permits need to be transferred or reissued to us. Depending on the permit, this requires either pre or post-closing notification to regulatory authorities or regulatory authority consent. The loss or delay of a significant permit or license could have a material effect on our operations and net sales. Our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production, use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of significant quantities of hazardous materials. Under certain environmental laws, liability for the cleanup of contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. We could be held responsible for all cleanup costs at a site, whether currently or formerly owned or operated, and regardless of fault, knowledge, timing or cause of the contamination. In addition, we may face liability for personal injury, property damage, and natural resource damage resulting from environmental conditions attributable to us. As such, a product spill or emission at one of our facilities or during transportation could have adverse consequences on the environment and surrounding community and could result in significant liabilities with respect to investigation and remediation. Our sites have an extended history of industrial use, and soil and groundwater contamination exists at some of our sites. Under certain environmental laws, liability for the cleanup of contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. As of December 31, 2015, we have current remediation or monitoring obligations at our sites in Rahway, NJ; Dominguez, CA; Martinez, CA; 37 ----- Hammond, IN; Portland, OR and Rio Claro, Brazil, as well as a formerly owned site in Tacoma, WA. The Martinez facility also is involved in a long-term project to remediate and restore the Peyton Slough, an adjacent surface water estuary that was contaminated as a result of historical copper smelting activities on the Martinez site prior to the acquisition of the property. This project is in its final stages. Our reserves associated with environmental matters were $9.9 million as of December 31, 2015. There also is a potential risk that our longterm industrial use of these sites may have resulted in yet to be discovered contamination, which we could be required to investigate and, if warranted, remediate, as liability potentially could be imposed without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such hazardous substances and, in some cases, liability may be joint and several. Discovery of additional or unknown conditions at our facilities could have an adverse impact on our business by substantially increasing our capital expenditures, compliance or investigation, and remediation costs. Further, we may be jointly and severally liable for contamination at third party sites where we or our predecessors in interest have sent waste for treatment or disposal even if in doing so we complied with applicable laws.

Growing concern about the sources and impacts of global climate change has led to a number of domestic and foreign legislative and administrative measures, both proposed and enacted, to monitor, regulate and limit carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. In the EU, our emissions are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading System, or EU ETS, an EU-wide trading scheme for industrial GHG emissions. The EU ETS is anticipated to become progressively more stringent over time, including by reducing the number of allowances to emit GHGs that EU member states will allocate without charge to industrial facilities. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated federal GHG regulations under the Clean Air Act affecting certain sources. The EPA has issued mandatory GHG reporting requirements, under which our Dominguez, CA and Baton Rouge, LA facilities currently report. Moreover, California has enacted the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, or Assembly Bill 32, a law that establishes a comprehensive program to reduce GHG emissions from all sources throughout the state and contains reporting requirements under which our Dominguez, CA and Martinez, CA facilities report. Our Dominguez facility participates in the emissions trading market established under Assembly Bill 32. Although we believe it is likely that GHG emissions will continue to be regulated in the United States and other countries (in addition to the EU) in the future, we cannot yet predict the form such regulation will take (such as a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate any costs that we may be required to incur in respect of such requirements, for example, to install emissions control equipment, purchase emissions allowances, administer and manage our GHG emissions program, or address other regulatory obligations. Such requirements also could adversely affect our energy supply, or the costs (and types) of raw materials we use for fuel.

It is not possible to definitively predict the actual amount of these liabilities or the timing thereof.

The integration process will be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the Eco operations include, among others: - failure to implement our business plan for the combined company; - the diversion of management attention and resources; - failure to retain customers or key suppliers; - unanticipated issues in integrating personnel, information, communications and other systems; - applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions; - unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; - failure to retain key employees; - operating, competitive and other risks inherent in PQ’s business and Eco’s business; and - unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.

As a private entity, we experienced management turnover and lack of resources following Eco’s separation from Solvay which led to insufficient knowledge to effectively support account balances and carry out formal control policies and framework and certain human resource and payroll records were inherited from Solvay, where no formal processes for record keeping were in place due to the process of transitioning to PQ’s human resource procedures and processes. These factors, along with adjustments identified in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, resulted in deficiencies that aggregated to a material weakness in Eco’s internal control over financial reporting. These adjustments relate primarily to reversals of various accruals that were overstated as of December 31, 2015. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of Eco’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. We cannot be certain that any measures we undertake will successfully remediate the material weakness or that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future.

The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition and other future trends. In the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. The security interest of the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, is subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral may significantly decrease.

For example, we do not expect that liens on mortgages on the real property owned by us or our subsidiaries and intended to secure the Notes and the guarantees will be in place at the time of the issuance of the Notes. The real properties intended to be mortgaged may constitute a significant portion of the value of the collateral intended to secure the Notes and the guarantees. To the extent any security interest in the collateral securing the notes and guarantees is required to be perfected and cannot be perfected on or prior to the closing date, the indenture governing the notes will require us to use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected, to the extent required by the indenture governing the notes and the security documents, promptly, and in any event within 120 days, following the issue date (unless the corresponding date for delivering such collateral under the New Term Loan Facility is extended, in which case the corresponding date for delivery of the collateral securing the notes shall be automatically extended). If we, or any guarantor, were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, any liens recorded or perfected after the issue date would face a greater risk of being invalidated than if they had been recorded or perfected on the issue date, and there will be no assurance prior to issuance of the Notes that all properties contemplated to be mortgaged as security for the Notes will be mortgaged, and any failure to deliver such mortgages, or any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery of such mortgages, may impact the value of the collateral. Liens recorded or perfected after the closing date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing debt is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date. Accordingly, if we or a guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the outstanding notes and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, or not yet perfected at all, the liens securing the Notes may be especially subject to challenge as a result of having not been perfected before the closing date.

Furthermore, no surveys or title insurance have been or will be delivered as to such real properties at the time of issuance of the Notes. As a result, there is and will be no independent assurance that, among other things, (i) the real property encumbered by the mortgages includes all of the property owned by us and our guarantors that we intend to include, (ii) that our title to such owned or leased real property is not encumbered by liens and other defects not permitted by the indenture and (iii) no unpaid taxes, encroachments, adverse possession claims, zoning or other restrictions exist with respect to such owned or leased real properties which could result in a material adverse effect on the value or utility of such owned or leased real properties. 51 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Liens on after-acquired real estate owned by certain Guarantors and improvements may not be created in certain jurisdictions where our real property that is subject to mortgages is located unless the appropriate security document is amended to include such real property. Applicable laws may also limit the ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on the improved real property collateral. Furthermore, applicable laws that govern the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure of mortgage liens against real property which secure debt obligations such as the Notes may impose procedural requirements for foreclosure differing from and necessitating a longer time period for completion than the requirements for foreclosure of security interest in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even if it has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a right of redemption after foreclosure. Applicable law may also impose security first and one form of action rules, which rules can affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property collateral regardless of the location of the collateral and may limit the right to recover a deficiency following a foreclosure. The holders of the Notes and the Trustee also may be limited in their ability to enforce a breach of the covenant pertaining to liens. Some decisions of certain state courts have placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate debt as a result of a breach of this type of a covenant. Under these decisions, a lender seeking to accelerate debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens or leasehold estates may need to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default. Although the foregoing court decisions may have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal laws, the scope of such preemption, if any, is uncertain. Accordingly, a court could prevent the Trustee and the holders of the Notes from declaring a default and accelerating the Notes by reason of a breach of this covenant, which could have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders to enforce the covenant.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

The liens in the collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of such Notes if the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens or if mortgages are not recorded. In addition, applicable law provides that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate of title and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The issuer and the subsidiary guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the noteholders’ security interest in specified collateral. There can be no assurance that the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, will monitor, or that we will inform the trustee of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be 52 ----- taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interest.

Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), a secured creditor such as the trustee, as the collateral agent for the Notes, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from such debtor, without bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default nder the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security if and at such times as the bankruptcy court in its discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case; - whether or when the trustee, as collateral agent for the Notes, could repossess or dispose of the collateral; - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition; or - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.” Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require permission from the bankruptcy court.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would be, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the Notes to receive post-petition interest and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the Notes to receive other “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws. In addition, if any payments of postpetition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the Notes. 53 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

PQ’s existing indirect shareholders, affiliates of CCMP, affiliates of INEOS and PQ’s management) and Eco’s existing indirect equity holders (affiliates of CCMP and Eco’s management) will constitute the stockholders of New Holdings immediately following the closing of the Business Combination. The Business Combination will be effected as an equity-forequity transaction. The completion of the Business Combination is subject to certain closing conditions that are customary for transactions of this type, including regulatory clearance, which has been received. The Business Combination is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Eco is the accounting predecessor to New Holdings, as PQ was acquired by CCMP subsequent to CCMP’s acquisition of Eco, therefore Eco is deemed to be the accounting acquirer. The historical balance sheet data of each of Eco and PQ Holdings as of December 31, 2015 and the historical statement of income data for the year ended December 31, 2015 of each of Eco and PQ Holdings are derived from the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the above transactions. Further, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not include any other transactions since December 31, 2015. (1) Reflects the pro forma debt financing in connection with the Business Combination. The amounts reflect the issuance of $1,200,000 under the New Term Loan Facility, the issuance of $500,000 of Notes offered hereby, the issuance of $625,000 of the New Senior Unsecured Notes, the repayment of $1,197,950 under the existing PQ Term Facility and $495,000 under the Eco Term Facility and the redemption of the $600,000 2018 Notes. The $70,502 of deferred financing and original issue discount (“OID”) represents deferred financing fees on existing Eco debt that was not written off, additional fees associated with the issuance of the new debt, net of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and OID of the debt repaid in connection with the Business Combination. The cash used from the balance sheet as part of the sources and uses of the transaction is $57,098 resulting from the gross proceeds of $2,325,000 less repayments of $2,292,950 of existing debt, $62,848 of deferred financing and OID, and the call premium relating to the 2018 Notes of $26,300.

1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,2640,UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,2640.10,,2640.10.1,,"The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been derived by applying pro forma adjustments to the historical audited consolidated financial statements of Eco and PQ Holdings included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 gives effect to the Business Combination and related financing transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2015. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015 gives effect to the Business Combination and related refinancing transactions as if they occurred on January 1, 2015. We describe the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that are factually supportable and that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not represent what our actual consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial condition would have been had the Business Combination and related refinancing transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Presentation of Financial Information,” “Summary—The Business Combination,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of Eco,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of PQ Holdings,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Eco,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of PQ Holdings” and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of each of Eco and PQ Holdings included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to our unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflecting the Business Combination and related refinancing transactions will be based upon the acquisition method of accounting and upon the assumptions set forth in the notes included in this section. The unaudited pro forma adjustments and allocation of the excess acquisition purchase price over the tangible and intangible net assets acquired to intangible assets and goodwill are preliminary and based on management’s best estimate of the fair value of intangible assets acquired relating to the Business Combination. The final purchase price allocation for the Business Combination is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of asset and liability valuations. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not completed the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the purchase price for the Business Combination. We have allocated the total estimated purchase price for the Business Combination, calculated as described in Note 1 under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of their fair values. In arriving at the estimated fair market values, the Company has considered many factors, including but not limited to, the appraisals by independent consultants which were based on a preliminary and limited review of the assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed. There are no assurances that the final estimate of fair market values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will not be materially different from the estimated fair market values thereof once a more detailed and thorough review of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is performed. The final valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets that exist as of the closing date. Final adjustments will change the allocations of purchase price, which will affect the fair value assigned to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed and will result in a change to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, including a change to goodwill. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. 60 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

The decrease in sales was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange variations compared to the same period in the prior year ($96.3 million) and to lower volumes in Performance Chemicals and Potters, partially offset by higher average selling price and customer mix improvement. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, net sales increased $5.7 million, or 0.5%. - Gross profit decreased $20.8 million to $275.6 million. Our decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation ($26.0 million). Pricing was strong across nearly all businesses to cover increases in manufacturing costs, depreciation expense and unfavorable product mix. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, gross profit increased $5.2 million, or 1.8%. - Operating income increased $2.6 million to $117.0 million.

Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, net sales decreased $3.4 million, or 0.4%. The stronger U.S. dollar compared to a number of other major currencies, including the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Euro, the British pound, unfavorably impacted our sales. The lower volume is primarily driven by lower zeolite and magnesium sulfate demand, as well as metasilicate and spray dry sales volumes into the drilling end-uses in the Americas and sodium silicate sales volumes in Europe, partially offset by increased demand for spray dry silicate for use in automatic dishwasher detergents and zeolite sales volumes in Europe. The higher average sales price is principally a result of average selling price increases for higher manufacturing costs under our cost adjusted pass-through contracts in the Americas and favorable U.S. dollar-denominated pricing in certain foreign locations. Lower pricing in Europe from unfavorable product and customer mix, slightly offset this favorable pricing impact.

Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, gross profit decreased $3.7 million, or 1.9%. The higher manufacturing costs were primarily driven by higher U.S. dollar-denominated raw material purchases in foreign entities, inflation costs in the Americas, and higher maintenance and production costs in Europe. These were partially offset by lower natural gas costs and favorable fixed cost absorption from the timing of inventory build in the Americas and Europe. The product mix improvements resulted primarily in Europe from reduced sales of lower margin sodium silicates and increased sales of higher margin spray dry silicates, partially offset from lower sales of higher margin magnesium sulfate, metasilicate and spray dry products in the Americas.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, net sales increased $7.5 million, or 13.9%. The higher volume is primarily driven by strong demand across nearly all of our product lines, primarily in our chemical catalyst product line serving the methyl methacrylate end-uses and the product lines serving the HDPE producers.

The stronger U.S. dollar across certain of our major currencies including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, the Euro, the British pound, Mexican peso and Japanese yen, unfavorably impacted our sales. The 79 ----- unfavorable sales volume was driven by lower volumes in the EGM division, including the hollowspheres, conductive, metal finishing and spheriglass product lines. Greater demand for other transportation safety division products in most regions partially offset the lower sales. Pricing increased mainly for transportation safety division products in the Americas and in certain EGM division product lines, including hollowspheres and spheriglass.

Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, gross profit increased $12.2 million, or 16.2%. The lower manufacturing costs were primarily driven by lower raw material costs including natural gas, silver and cullet, reduced shipping costs, and by favorable fixed cost absorption from inventory build of EGM division products in North America. These were partially offset by higher fixed costs and freight transportation costs in North America. The favorable volume contribution is from higher shipped volumes of transportation safety products across most regions, partially offset by lower EGM volume contribution.

The increase in sales, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to increased volumes of $21.5 million and higher average selling price and mix improvements of $9.5 million, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $12.9 million. The higher volume is primarily driven by greater demand in Performance Chemicals sodium and potassium silicates, magnesium sulfate, and spray dry silicate volumes in the Americas and sodium silicate, magnesium silicate, and specialty silicas volumes in Europe. The higher average sales price is principally a result of average selling price increases for higher manufacturing costs under our cost adjusted pass-through contracts in the Americas and favorable product mix in EMEA & Asia for certain product lines. Unfavorable customer mix in sodium silicate in Performance Chemicals slightly offset this favorable pricing impact. The stronger U.S. dollar compared to a number of other major currencies, including the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, and the Australian dollar, unfavorably impacted our sales. This impact is offset partially by a weaker U.S. dollar compared with the Euro and British pound.

The increase was primarily due to higher volumes of $13.0 million, partially offset by lower average selling price and mix of $1.4 million and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $3.2 million. The higher sales volume was driven by stronger demand in the EGM division including the conductive, hollowspheres, spheriglass, and metal finishing product lines. The reduced average selling price was driven primarily from lower silver pass-through pricing in our conductive product line and lower customer mix impact of hollowsphere sales, partially offset from favorable price increases in the transportation safety division in North America. The stronger U.S. dollar across certain of our major currencies including the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, and Japanese yen, unfavorably impacted our sales. This impact is offset partially by a weaker U.S. dollar compared with the Euro and British pound. 83 ----- Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $75.5 million, a decrease of $5.2 million, or 6.4 %, compared with $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The favorable inventory change was principally the result of depletion of higher prior year inventory from greater volume sales in the EGM division of Specialty Glass Materials and in Europe for Performance Chemicals. Further, favorable Performance Chemicals inventory change resulted from purchases of raw materials at lower costs in Europe, partially offset from higher inventory in the Americas as compared to prior year and in the Silica Catalyst business from planned inventory build. The unfavorable change in accounts payable was primarily due to lower current year Performance Chemicals raw material pricing in Europe, and from slightly lower current year capital spend as compared to year-end 2013 in the Americas and Europe, partially offset by the increased level of current year capital expenditures and the timing of payments in Specialty Glass Materials.

The investment in affiliated companies was made to fund the capital expansion in our Zeolyst C.V. joint venture in both 2013 and 2014. The Company received an offsetting $10.0 million of dividends in 2014 and $18 million in 2013 of dividends from our Zeolyst International joint venture resulting in no overall cash impact to the Company.

Customers take title and assume all the risks of ownership upon shipment (if terms are “FOB shipping point”) or upon delivery (if terms are “FOB destination”). Any deviation from the standard terms and arrangements are reviewed for the proper accounting treatment, and revenue recognition is revised accordingly. 92 ----- We recognize rebates given to customers as a reduction of revenues based on an allocation of the cost of honoring rebates earned and claimed to each of the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer toward earning the rebate. Rebates are recognized at the time revenue is recorded. We measure the rebate obligation based on the estimated amount of sales that will result in a rebate at the adjusted sales price per the respective sales agreement. Amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction-related to shipping and handling, if any, represent revenues earned for the goods provided and are classified as revenue. Costs related to shipping and handling of products shipped to customers are classified as cost of goods sold. We make certain assumptions and estimates when accruing for allowances for doubtful accounts. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. A specific reserve for bad debt is recorded for known or suspected doubtful accounts receivable. For all other accounts, we recognize a reserve for bad debt based on the length of time receivables are past due and historical write-off experience. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Our estimates and assumptions made under the revenue recognition policy have been applied on a consistent basis.

We capitalize the cost of furnace rebuilds as part of property, plant and equipment. Plant and equipment under capital leases are carried at the present value of minimum lease payments. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred. We capitalize internal costs associated with the implementation of purchased software. When property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the net carrying amount is eliminated with any gain or loss on disposition recognized in earnings at that time. Depreciation is generally provided on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging up to thirty-three years for buildings, ten to twelve years for machinery and equipment, and three to seven years for computer hardware and software. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. A write-down occurs in periods in which it is determined that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its book value. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we can either perform a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment on the reporting units. Under a qualitative assessment, we will consider the relevant events and circumstances and the extent to which they could affect the comparison of a reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying amount and form a conclusion indicating whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Under the quantitative assessment, we first compare a reporting unit’s book value of net assets, including goodwill, to its fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To the extent that the book value exceeds fair value, we would be required to perform a 93 ----- second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss. See Note 11 in the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on goodwill impairment. We had goodwill cushion (which represents the percentage difference between each of our five reporting unit’s estimated fair value and its related carrying value) which varied between 38% and 175% as of our annual impairment test on October 1, 2015. We perform an impairment review of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows. When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is found not to be recoverable, then an impairment loss is recognized. Any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. Fair value is determined using quoted market prices where available, or other techniques including discounted cash flows. Our estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance, economic conditions, and technological changes that may affect the future useful lives of the assets. The amortization periods for formulations and product technology range from ten to twelve years. We amortize customer relationships over periods that range from nine to twenty years. The amortization period for the non-compete agreements range from five to six and a half years. Amortizable trademarks are amortized over a ten-year period. The amortization periods for the patents range from eight to fourteen years.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Benefits in the U.S. defined benefit plan and the service portion of the Canadian defined benefit plan were frozen as of December 31, 2006. Benefits for a majority of the plans are based on average final pay and years of service. Our funding policy, consistent with statutory requirements, is based on actuarial computations utilizing the projected unit credit method of calculation. Not all defined benefit pension plans are funded. In the United States and Canada, the pension plans’ assets include equity, and fixed income securities. Certain assumptions are made regarding the occurrence of future events affecting pension costs, such as mortality, withdrawal, disablement and retirement, changes in compensation and benefits, and discount rates to reflect the time value of money. The major elements in determining our pension income and expense are pension liability discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. We reference rates of return on high-quality, fixed income investments when estimating the discount rate, and the expected period over which payments will be made based upon historical experience. The long-term rate of return used to calculate the expected return on plan assets is the average rate of return estimated to be earned on invested funds for providing pension benefits. In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain health care benefits for employees who meet age, participation and length of service requirements at retirement. These plans were closed to new retirees in the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2006. We use explicit assumptions using the best estimates available of the plan’s future experience. Principal actuarial assumptions include discount rates, present value factors, retirement age, participation rates, mortality rates, cost trend rates, Medicare reimbursement rates and per capita claims cost by age.

We use the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the 94 ----- results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized. In determining the provision for income taxes, we provide deferred income taxes on income from foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are deemed by us not to be permanently reinvested as such earnings are taxable upon remittance to the United States. We establish contingent liabilities for possible assessments by taxing authorities resulting from uncertain tax positions including, but not limited to, transfer pricing, deductibility of certain expenses and other state, local, and foreign tax matters. We recognize a financial statement benefit for positions taken for tax return purposes when it will be more-likely-than-not that the positions will be sustained. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Our management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability is accrued in our financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.

The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The foreign currencies to which we have the most 95 ----- significant exchange rate exposure include the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. Sales in these top five currencies represent approximately 42% of our total sales during the year ended December 31, 2015. A 10% change in these currencies would impact sales by approximately $43.1 million, or 4% of consolidated sales assuming product pricing remain constant. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income. The impact of gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant operations are included in other non-operating expense. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Net foreign exchange included in other expense was a $21.1million loss, and a $23.4 million loss, for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The foreign currency loss realized in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were primarily driven by the non-permanent intercompany debt denominated in local currency translated to U.S. dollars and were principally non-cash in nature.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Eco expects growing petroleum 101 ----- exports to continue to offset softening domestic demand growth. However, in 2015, lower crude oil prices and the resulting lower gasoline prices have contributed to a 3.3% year over year increase in domestic gasoline consumption. The United States Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”) projects net exports of petroleum products to grow at a 2.3% CAGR from 2013 to 2040. The export market for U.S. refineries has become more favorable due to competitively priced oil supplies and the related idling of uncompetitive European based refining capacity.

Increasing regulatory standards, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards which regulate mile per gallon performance in light vehicle manufacturing, have resulted in a proliferation of turbo-charged and other engine types that require higher octane fuel ratings. Increasing the octane rating of gasoline requires the use of blending agents, among which alkylate is preferred due to its effectiveness and lower emissions. While increased fuel efficiency in vehicles tends to decrease gasoline demand, it also tends to increase the relative contribution of alkylates in gasoline refining, increasing sulfuric acid demand. Increasing regulatory standards, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards which regulate mile per gallon performance in light vehicle manufacturing, have resulted in a proliferation of turbo-charged and other engine types that require higher-octane fuel ratings. Increasing the octane rating of gasoline requires the use of blending agents, among which alkylate is preferred due to effectiveness and lower emissions. In March 2016, the EIA reported that premium gasoline sales as a percentage of overall gasoline sales in 2015 had risen 11.3% up from 7.8% in 2008. The EIA concluded that the increase was likely due to the higher-octane requirements of new light duty vehicles. The EPA’s Tier 3 Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards Program prescribes new proposed sulfur regulations which will take effect in 2017. The regulations will stipulate lower allowable sulfur content in gasoline, from the current standard of 30 parts per million (“ppm”) to a proposed limit of 10 ppm throughout the United States, with the exception of California which already has a 10 ppm sulfur limit. These regulations will require refineries to remove more sulfur from hydrocracked gasoline, which causes a lowering of the octane rating of that gasoline. To raise the octane rating, alkylate is expected to be an attractive blending component since its typical sulfur content is around 5 ppm. Butane, another widely used octane enhancer, typically has higher sulfur content and much higher vapor pressure than alkylate. Higher demand for alkylate production is expected to result in increased demand for sulfuric acid by oil refineries. The growth in shale-oil derived crude production in the United States is projected to continue to benefit the refining industry. According to OPEC, tight oil production in the United States will increase 26% from 2014 levels to four million barrels per day by 2020. The lighter crude oil produced from shale generates lower octane gasoline, which can demand more alkylate in order to boost octane to required levels. Another trend being observed currently is the proliferation of gasses such as isobutane and propylene, which are used as feed stocks in a refinery’s alkylation process. The accumulation is due to the increased production of shale gas and shale oil, which has increased the production of by-product isobutane and propane (used to produce propylene). According to EIA data, U.S. Gas Plant production of isobutane has grown by 58% between 2010 and 2015. The rise in volume of alkylate feed stocks released through the extraction and refining of shale gas and crudes has resulted in more of those feedstocks, such as isobutane to be used in the production process. The conversion process used to turn isobutane and propylene into alkylates requires a high volume of sulfuric acid and thus the proliferation of isobutane and propylene is driving demand for sulfuric acid. 102 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Additionally, Eco believes its mining customers have long reserve lives and are increasing production to meet global consumption demand for copper and borates. Both of these trends are expected to lead to higher virgin sulfuric acid demand. Excluding the refining industry, which is served primarily by acid regeneration, the four virgin sulfuric acid demand regions are (i) the Southwest, primarily from the mining industry users; (ii) the Gulf Coast, led by the nylon and general chemical and industrial users; (iii) the Midwest, driven by agricultural and general chemical users; and (iv) the East, primarily from general chemical and industrial users including pulp and paper and water treatment. In 2015, in Eco’s virgin sulfuric acid product line, Eco primarily served the Nylon (30% of 2015 net sales), General Industrial and Chemical (29% of 2015 net sales) and Mining (25% of 2015 net sales) end-uses. Nylon._ Sulfuric acid is used in the production of caprolactam, the key constituent of nylon. Globally, demand for caprolactam, a compound used almost exclusively for the manufacture of nylon, is expected to grow by 3.2% annually between 2013 and 2018, with Asia accounting for 70% of global demand for caprolactam by 2018. The U.S. nylon industry currently benefits from access to low-cost natural gas feedstock, positioning domestic producers strongly to capitalize on forecasted growth relative to higher-cost European exporters. As of 2013, the United States produced approximately 17% of the global caprolactam supply. General Industrial and Chemical._ Eco’s general industrial and chemical customers comprise a broad range of sulfuric acid users, including lead-acid battery manufacturers and customers that consume acid in an industrial chemical or manufacturing process, or use sulfuric acid to treat waste streams resulting from the process. Low cost feedstock in the United States has fueled more than an estimated $100 billion of expenditures related to project announcements for 148 new plants and/or expansions of existing plants in the chemical sector primarily in the Gulf Coast, which Eco believes will increase demand for virgin sulfuric acid over time. Copper Mining._ Copper consumers use sulfuric acid in their copper leaching processes, sourcing acid from both their own production facilities and from the merchant producers. Total global copper consumption is expected to increase by 27% between 2014 and 2024. Borax Mining._ Eco’s borate customer produces approximately 30% of the world’s borates, which are used to produce boric acid used in specialty glass applications, such as LED, LCD and smart devices, fiberglass, solar cells, and crop yield and pesticide products.

Revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of the agreement, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable. Cost of Sales._ Cost of sales includes fixed and variable costs to manufacture procure and ship products and provide services sold and recognized as sales revenue. Variable costs are those costs that vary depending on Eco’s production volume. Excluding freight, variable costs in Eco’s regeneration product line primarily consist of natural gas, caustic, electricity and water. Excluding freight, variable costs in Eco’s virgin product line primarily consist of sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, caustic soda and electricity. Fixed costs include plant fixed costs such as labor, maintenance, insurance, property taxes as well as fixed freight costs. Contribution Margin._ Contribution margin represents sales less variable costs and is a non-GAAP measure.

The purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values. The purchase price allocation, which is based on the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, resulted in Eco recording goodwill of $311.9 million. Eco believes that expected synergies of the acquisition is the primary reason that contributed to a total purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Eco has historically assessed the goodwill and the tradename indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis at December 31, and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that book value may exceed fair value. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, Eco voluntarily changed its annual impairment assessment date to October 1, for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with its strategic planning process, preparation of its long-term financial budget and cash flow projections and to ensure annual testing occurs within one year of the 2014 Acquisition. Eco believes that this change in measurement date, which represents a change in method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable under the circumstances, and did not result in the delay, acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge. Eco prospectively applied the change to the annual impairment assessment date beginning October 1, 2015, as there was no impairment assessment performed as of December 31, 2014, as the Acquisition occurred December 1, 2014.

Certain manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial use. As is typical in the specialty chemicals business, soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past at certain sites and might occur or be discovered in the future at other sites. Investigation and remediation or monitoring soil and groundwater contamination is currently in process at certain of these sites. In addition, Eco is currently involved as a potentially responsible party under federal and state statutes requiring remediation resulting from past waste disposal practices at certain sites, including inactive sites. Currently, Eco is participating in environmental assessments, remedial investigations/feasibility studies and remediation efforts at these and other sites that may involve additional environmental costs in the future. Periodic analyses are performed for environmental risks and the corresponding provisions. The provisions are measured to the best of management’s knowledge and applicable regulations, the nature and extent of the pollution, clean up techniques and other available information. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the discovery of new remedial sites, discovery of new information and scarcity of reliable information pertaining to certain sites, improvements in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations, numerous possible remedial techniques and solutions, difficulty in assessing the involvement of and the financial capability of other potentially responsible parties (including insurers and other indemnities) and the extended time periods over which remediation occurs. As the environmental contingencies are more clearly determined, it is reasonably possible that amounts in excess of those amounts already accrued may be necessary and may be material. Additionally, there is a state mandate to remediate ground soil at one operating site in the event this site is shut down. There are no plans to sell, shut down or otherwise dispose of this site.

1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,2644,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF ECO,2644.19,Recently Issued Accounting Standards,2644.19.1,,"Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU’s”) to the FASB’s ASC. Management considers the applicability and impact of all ASU’s. ASU’s not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the financial position or results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for most leases but will recognize expenses similar to current lease accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Eco is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard’s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosures. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Eco is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.” The standard requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. These amendments do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first out or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out or average cost. The requirements of this standard are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. Eco is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its financial statements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, “Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.” As described above, the FASB issued ASU 201503, which does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-ofcredit arrangements. ASU 2015-15 adds SEC paragraphs pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) meeting. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within Update 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, ASU 2015-15 adds language from the EITF that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. Eco has adopted the requirements of this standard as described above. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.” The standard will change the requirements for reporting measurement period adjustments to provisional amounts initially recognized in conjunction with a business combination. Under U.S. GAAP, an 116 ----- acquiring entity currently is required to retrospectively adjust, in prior period financial statements, the provisional amounts to reflect new information obtained during the measurement period (a period, which may not exceed one year from the date of the business combination, during which the acquiring entity may receive information about the facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date). Under the new guidance, adjustments to the provisional amounts will be reflected in the financial statements for the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined, including by recognizing in current period earnings the full effect of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects. The guidance requires that the acquiring entity either present separately on the face of the current period income statement or disclose in the notes to the current period financial statement, by line item, the amount of the adjustments made during the current period. The new guidance for nonpublic entities will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. Eco has elected to adopt the requirements of this standard as of December 31, 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

In Eco’s virgin sulfuric acid business its exposure to sulfur represented approximately 92% of Eco’s total variable costs for the year ended December 31, 2015. A $20 per ton increase in the cost of sulfur from current levels would cause the percentage of variable costs to increase to 93%. Eco typically does not enter into derivate financial instruments to hedge its commodity price risk and Eco does not currently have long- term supply contracts with key suppliers.

From 2005 to 2015, our Performance Chemicals business achieved a 5.4% sales CAGR and an 8.6% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR; our ability to grow throughout economic cycles was driven by the diverse consumer and industrial end-uses for our products, our local relationships and the global scale of our business. Our products are essential building blocks that impart critical performance characteristics in our customers’ end-products, yet typically represent a small portion of our customers’ overall end-product costs. Further, our cost structure and strategically located manufacturing facility network is a key competitive strength as many of our products have a very limited economic shipping distance. We are a global player and we believe we have leading positions across our portfolio of products. We expect favorable industry and competitive conditions to continue as a result of the attractive, environmentally-friendly attributes of silicates, large investment required to build new production capacity, the lack of cost-effective substitute chemicals for sodium silicate and the low penetration of imported sodium silicate due to significant transportation costs and our short delivery cycle times. Many of our product lines have experienced growth due to our development of new product applications and new silicate formulations with improved performance characteristics, as well as our expansion into emerging geographies. New applications and formulations have enabled us to increase our margins in our Performance Chemicals business. For example, in 2013 we doubled the capacity of our Indonesian facility to address demand for our precipitated silicas used in toothpaste. We have also leveraged our strong R&D competencies to expand into higher value-added products and applications from our core silicate and zeolite platforms. For example, we have developed a zeolite-based titanium dioxide replacement for paints and coatings applications, and we are working on other innovative applications for our zeolites. We are also selling our sodium silicate to customers for use in green tires. In addition, we have recently introduced a sodium-silicate product which we believe has unique performance characteristics that eliminate certain complications that arise in shale drilling. Given the inorganic nature of our products, we have also benefited from a global trend toward more environmentallyfriendly chemical solutions.

Our ability to grow throughout economic cycles was driven by our industry-leading integrated product and service offering and the critical, non-discretionary nature of our product. We believe we operate in a consolidated industry with attractive fundamentals and significant capital costs associated with new sulfuric acid plants. Our integrated network of plants and logistics assets, which are integrated into our customers’ supply chains, are difficult to replicate and provides us with a significant competitive advantage and deeply entrenched customer relationships. We have established our leading industry share position in merchant sulfuric acid through a long and continuous operating history and the consistent delivery to our customers via integration into their supply chains. Our core operating value of “absolute reliability” reflects the critical, non-discretionary aspect of sulfuric acid usage from the perspective of our customers, who generally cannot operate without consuming sulfuric acid on a continuous basis. 124 ----- The following charts show our Sulfuric Acid business’s sales by region and end-use for the year ended December 31, 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

We also are subject to other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding chemical and product safety as well as employee health and safety matters, including process safety requirements. These laws and regulations may become more stringent over time and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in significant fines or penalties. For instance, in November 2015, PADEP issued a $1.7 million fine associated with alleged air emissions violations related to excessive short term emissions of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, and excessive long term 12-month rolling sums of the two pollutants, at our Chester, PA, site. We have appealed the alleged violation and associated fine. We also remain subject to a 2007 Consent Decree that resolves certain alleged Clean Air Act violations at our seven Eco operating locations involving NSR, PSD, and NSPS obligations under the federal rules for the pollutants sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid mist. The Consent Decree required Solvay (the owner at the time) to pay a $2 million penalty and spend approximately $34 million on air pollution controls at our facilities. Work under the Consent Decree has proceeded since 2007, and, we believe that all of the significant capital improvements related to the Consent Decree have been completed. One of our operating locations has been released from the scope of the Consent Decree and we are seeking release of the other locations covered by the Consent Decree. Finally, these laws and regulations require us to obtain environmental registrations, licenses, permits, and other approvals in order to operate and can require us to install expensive pollution control equipment at our facilities or incur other capital expenditures aimed at achieving or maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations. Due to the Business Combination, many of the business’ permits need to be transferred or reissued to us. Depending on the permit, this requires either pre or post-closing notification to regulatory authorities or regulatory authority consent. Our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production, use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of significant quantities of hazardous materials. Under certain environmental laws, liability for the cleanup of contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. We could be held responsible for all cleanup costs at a site, whether currently or formerly owned or operated, and regardless of fault, knowledge, timing or cause of the contamination. In addition, we may face liability for personal injury, property damage, and natural resource damage resulting from environmental conditions attributable to us. As such, a product spill or emission at one of our facilities or during transportation could have severe consequences on the environment and surrounding community and could result in significant liabilities with respect to investigation and remediation. Under certain environmental laws, liability for the cleanup of contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. As of December 31, 2015, we have current remediation or monitoring obligations at our sites in Rahway, NJ; Dominguez, CA; Martinez, CA; Hammond, 128 ----- IN; Portland, OR and Rio Claro, Brazil, as well as a formerly owned site in Tacoma, WA. The Martinez facility also is involved in a long-term project to remediate and restore the Peyton Slough, an adjacent surface water estuary that was contaminated as a result of historical copper smelting activities on the Martinez site prior to the acquisition of the property. This project is in its final stages. There also is a potential risk that our long-term industrial use of these sites may have resulted in yet to be discovered contamination, which we potentially could be required to investigate and, if warranted, remediate, as liability could be imposed without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such hazardous substances and, in some cases, liability may be joint and several. Discovery of additional or unknown conditions at our facilities could have an adverse impact on our business by substantially increasing our capital expenditures, compliance or investigation, and remediation costs. Further, we may be jointly and severally liable for contamination at third party sites where we or our predecessors in interest have sent waste for treatment or disposal even if in doing so we complied with applicable laws. Environmental matters are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the discovery of new remedial sites, discovery of new information and scarcity of reliable information pertaining to certain sites, improvements in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations, numerous possible remedial techniques and solutions, difficulty in assessing the involvement of and the financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and the extended time periods over which remediation occurs.

REACH requires registration of chemicals, along with a dossier of toxicological and ecotoxicity test results, or a plan to conduct such tests if currently unavailable. Registered chemicals then can be subject to further evaluation and potential restrictions. Our high-volume chemicals have been registered under REACH; up to 50 lower-volume chemicals (mainly catalysts) will be registered by the 2018 deadline. To date, no testing has been required. A couple of our chemicals are being reviewed under REACH. It is possible this will result in testing requirements, which, depending on the tests, can cost up to several million dollars.

Sodium silicate production technology is closely held among major North American and European manufacturers, with only a limited number of producers having a meaningful portion of merchant sodium silicate sales. The specific processes to produce different silicates and silicas and their derivatives are proprietary, requiring not only process know-how but significant capital investment. Sales of sodium silicate are regional in nature. Products cannot be economically transported long distances as the value-to-weight ratio and transportation costs become a limiting factor to sustainable profitability. As a result, silicate plants are spread out locally with a few large dedicated units for derivative production. Given this industry structure, there are limited imports of sodium silicate. The uses of silicates span a diverse range of applications, including binders and adhesives, stabilizers, corrosion inhibiters and metal scavenging, as well as a cost-effective source of alkalinity. Over the past decade, 132 ----- sodium silicate end-uses have shifted from uses such as powdered laundry and virgin pulp and paper production towards environmentally-friendly alternatives to commonly used chemicals, including fillers for roll-resistant green tires, coatings for recycled paper, geopolymers and reduced or zero phosphate cleaning products. Further, silicate and silicate derivatives are recognized on the EPA’s list of Design for the Environment, or the DFE, Safer Chemicals for use in consumer product production. Sodium silicate derivatives are also used as intermediates in the production of zeolites, precipitated silicas, silica gels, colloidal silicas and other derivatives. We believe certain of these derivative products represent the largest and fastest growing end-use applications for sodium silicate products. Sodium silicate derivative products are key building blocks for the production of silica catalysts, specialty zeolite-based catalysts, CMP slurries and adsorbents in a variety of applications. Based on industry estimates, from 2013 to 2018, both U.S. and global demand for sodium silicates are expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 2%. We continue to expect near-term volume for cleaning products, pulp and paper and construction to be consistent with overall economic growth in the United States, though the displacement of less environmentally-friendly chemicals in some higher value applications will continue to grow at a higher rate than the underlying end-uses. Generally, we have experienced growth rates in excess of U.S. real gross domestic product, or GDP, for production of precipitated silica and colloidal silica for use in tires and the computer chip industry.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

We manufacture a range of silica gels and precipitated silica products for a variety of end-use applications. Silica gels are used as adsorbents in beverage and oil processing applications and as functional ingredients in paints and coatings, food and ink jet applications. Our major customers for specialty adsorbents include major breweries, food processors, edible oil refiners and biodiesel producers. Specialty products serve as adsorbents and clarifiers in the beer production process and we believe are now used by the majority of beer producers. Consumption of specialty silicas in the brewing industry has been relatively stable due to overall global beer consumption trends, which have generally shown consistency through economic cycles. Further, once an adsorbent is specified by a brewer for a specific formulation, it is rare for the brewer to change the suppliers due to taste uniformity and customer loyalty. Silica gel adsorbents are also used to selectively remove polar impurities from triglyceride oils for edible and industrial applications. Uses of silica products in this application offer a number of cost savings and environmental benefits, while improving quality and yield of the processed oil. We supply adsorbent products for the purification of feedstock for biodiesel production, allowing biofuels producers to use a wider range of waste and non-edible oil feedstocks. Precipitated silica uses include green tire applications, footwear, batteries, food and healthcare products and agricultural products. In precipitated silicas, we have recently worked with our customers to optimize our manufacturing process for high whitening and desensitizing toothpaste applications that meet an increasingly attractive consumer preference where our products are displacing less environmentally-friendly materials and offering cleaning performance with low abrasion. Growth in this application is driven by rising middle classes in developing regions and consumer demand for natural ingredients and premium branding. Based on industry estimates, from 2013 to 2018, global demand for specialty silicas is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 5%, and U.S. demand is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 3%. Rubber applications, tires and footwear are the leading applications for precipitated silica and the fastest 133 ----- growing. Some of the increase in demand for precipitated silica is primarily based on the trend to use fuelefficient low-resistance tires. The use of silicas with silanes can improve rolling resistance, saving up to 8% of fuel consumption. These “Green Tires” are composed of rubber, carbon black and silica. However, the silica consumption in green tires is double the amount in standard tires, replacing carbon black. The global share of green tires is expected to increase from 15% in 2011 to 34% in 2016 and 40 to 45% by 2018. The volume of precipitated silica in green tires is projected to grow at more than 6% annually during 2013 to 2018, as compared to just above 5% annually during 2013 to 2018 in all other applications.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Zeolites are found in a variety of commercial products, including adsorbents and detergents. Historically, zeolites were predominantly used as a key input for the production of detergents. Over the last decade, however, the North American powdered detergent usage has declined as consumer preferences have shifted away from powder detergents to less zeoliteintensive liquid detergents. Since 2000, the demand for zeolite for detergent applications has decreased. As a result, we believe we are the major manufacturer of North American zeolites used in detergents due to our favorable integrated cost position, logistics footprint and capabilities and strong process technology. Zeolites for detergent end-uses now represent a significantly less meaningful product line within our company, as evidenced by its decreasing percentage of global sales from 16% of sales in the year ended December 31, 2009 to 8% of sales in the year ended December 31, 2015. To address this industry shift which has resulted in available zeolite production capacity, we have aggressively focused on developing new applications for our zeolite technology. As an example, applications we have focused on include stabilizers in the production of polyvinylchloride, or PVC, a titanium dioxide replacement for paints and coatings applications as well as our coatings applications for food grade paper.

According to industry sources, global HDPE consumption is expected to grow by approximately 5% annually from 2014 to 2019 and will be driven by the general level of economic activity and the increased utilization of HDPE as a substitute for heavier and more expensive materials such as glass and metals. Further, we believe that we will disproportionately benefit from the increased HDPE capacity coming on stream in the United States, where we believe our position is strong, as a result of resin producers benefitting from advantageous feedstock sources derived from the favorable U.S. shale gas position. Typically, these catalysts are specified by process licensors to produce resins with specific properties. As a result, these catalysts are often covered under long-term supply agreements and we are often our customers’ sole source supplier. Catalyst products are typically developed alongside end-users, with significant upfront time required in order to ensure that specifications are appropriately met. Silica catalysts are also sold for chemical synthesis uses. For example, we are the supplier of catalyst to a leading producer of MMA for use in its proprietary MMA production process. MMA is a clear, scratch-resistant plastic that is used in sheet-form to replace glass, surface coatings and molding compounds. According to industry sources, the demand for MMA is expected to grow by approximately 3% annually from 2014 to 2019.

As global awareness and action against environmental issues posed by pollution / emissions from stationary and mobile sources has risen, so has the importance of emissions control catalysts. The tightening of emissions standards in the U.S., continual tightening in Europe, and the planned tightening in Japan and Korea for LDD and HDD engines have contributed to meaningful demand growth for specialty zeolite-based catalysts in recent years and will continue to support growth in the future. Increasing regulations in both on and off-road heavy duty diesel engines is expected over the next years, including regulations related to the Euro VI emissions standards issued by the European Union. Despite limited regulations in emerging markets, major HDD engine producers are likely to adopt a globally regulated engine model. New legislative trends will affect production of heavy duty diesel vehicle regulated engines. Within Europe, post the implementation of Euro VI, there are advanced discussions regarding U.S. GHG type legislation. The expectation is that the introduction in 2019 to 2020 of stricter Stage V emission limits for non-road machinery will increase demand for catalysts. In Asia, China’s Euro IV nationwide from January 2015 has driven volumes. Between 2014 and 2020, industry sources estimate global HDD engine production growth of approximately 11%. North America expects GHG regulations to tighten in 2020 and tighter NOx standards may be implemented. Hence, growth there is expected to be slower. New legislative trends will affect production of light duty vehicle regulated engines as well. Regulations including Euro VIb, for diesel engines, and Euro VIc, for gasoline engines are expected to drive catalyst sales growth. North America Tier 3 regulations are on track for 2017 implementation with expected associated LDD engine growth to be moderate.

We produce a custom product / catalyst called titanium silicate or TS-1 that is used in the catalytic process to produce caprolactam. TS-1 use in the production of caprolactam is a key component in the “green” redesigned manufacturing process of nylon, particularly in the developing world. As of 2013, Chinese customers represented a 33%, and growing, share of global caprolactam demand. According to industry sources, Chinese demand for caprolactam is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 8% from 2013 to 2018. Oil refinery cracking processes enable the production of gasoline and other lighter products from sour, heavier crude oil and residues. Hydrocracking is a major source for producing diesel fuel, jet fuel, gasoline components and liquefied petroleum gas. The rate of cracking and the end-products produced are strongly dependent on the temperature and presence of hydrocracking catalysts. Through Zeolyst International, we provide various specialty zeolite-based hydrocracking catalysts that deliver an excellent balance between the desired yield targets, product properties and extended lives. We sell hydrocracking catalysts to oil refineries and other petrochemical manufacturers as a consumable that must be replaced on a periodic basis (every three to five years). Although the input costs of hydrocracking catalysts are small when compared to the overall variable raw material costs for operating a refinery, the impact to a refiner for utilizing low quality or contaminated catalysts could be extremely high. As a result, refiners choose to purchase high quality catalysts from well-known manufacturers, and typically value performance and reliability over price when making buying decisions. Global demand for the critical hydrocracking process is expected to continue to drive the demand for hydrocracking catalysts. In addition to hydrocracking catalysts, we also produce specialty and custom catalysts which are primarily developed for paraxylene isomerization, upstream intermediates in the manufacturing of polyester and isobutylene isomerization for the production of methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, a fuel oxygenator. Another important area of growth for specialty zeolite-based catalytic technology is in gas-to-liquid conversion.

Alkylate is considered to be the best blending component for gasoline because of its superior ability to boost octane and its low vapor pressure relative to substitutes such as ethanol and butane. As of 2014, approximately 45-50% of North American refineries with alkylation capability refining capacity of over 100,000 BPD utilized sulfuric acid alkylation technology and approximately 52% utilize hydrofluoric acid alkylation technology. Sulfuric acid alkylation is the preferred technology from a health, safety, and environmental perspective, but the switching costs to change from one alkylation technology to another is extremely high. No refinery in North America has made the transition from using hydrofluoric acid alkylation to using sulfuric acid alkylation. Sulfuric acid alkylation is typically utilized in larger refineries with alkylation units using sulfuric acid as the key catalyst in the alkylation of olefins with isobutane. Once used in an alkylation unit, the sulfuric acid becomes diluted with water and hydrocarbons, becoming “spent” and needing to be recycled. From a regulatory standpoint, sulfuric acid regeneration is the only feasible way for refineries to manage their spent acid and receive fresh acid for reuse in their alkylation processes. Since storage of fresh and spent acid is limited, and the cost to refineries of interruption to their alkylation units is prohibitive, refiners require a continuous and reliable sulfuric acid supply chain. By providing regeneration services, as well as purchasing by-product sulfur from customers for use in manufacturing fresh acid, we play an integral part in managing the sulfuric acid supply chains of our refining customers. There are a number of positive drivers which we believe will increase future demand for alkylate and refined products, including, increased U.S. exports of refined product given the lower cost position created by cheaper natural gas and domestic oil, increased refining of shale oil will require more alkylate blending to achieve desired octane levels, increased use of C3 (propylene) and C5 (amylene) (vs. C4 (butylene)) olefin feedstock for alkylation units because of the availability of natural gas liquid by-products from shale drilling, Tier 3 regulatory standards on vehicle efficiency and gasoline sulfur content drive demand for alkylate and alkylate substitutes ethanol and butane hitting blending limits.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control occurring after the Issue Date, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the registered address of such Holder or otherwise electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control 166 ----- Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes at the close of business on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered, subject to extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control as described below) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control is delayed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) if such written notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded or amended in the event that the Company shall determine that the Change of Control will not occur by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; (6) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (7) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes, provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, an electronic transmission (PDF), facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes with proof of ownership, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; and (8) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow. Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and cancelled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase by the Issuer of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On or before, as applicable, the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; 167 ----- (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities will prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements. The Senior Credit Facilities will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to senior indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default thereunder, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance such Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance such Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under such Indebtedness being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.” The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. After the Issue Date, we have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” 168 ----- under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. A Change of Control Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other properties or assets, in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business; (3) to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) other assets that, in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or other assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale;

Any Collateral Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale of Collateral that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Collateral Excess _Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds exceeds $40.0 million, the Company shall_ make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Obligations under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, to the holders of such other Pari Passu Obligations (a “Collateral Asset Sale _Offer”) to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations_ that is in an amount equal to at least $2,000, that may be purchased out of the Collateral Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Company will commence a Collateral Asset Sale Offer with respect to Collateral Excess Proceeds within thirty Business Days after the date that Collateral Excess Proceeds exceed $40.0 million by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Collateral Net Proceeds from a Collateral Asset Sale by making a Collateral Asset Sale Offer (an “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a portion of any Collateral Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) prior to the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to Collateral Excess Proceeds of $40.0 million or less. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations tendered pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer is less than the Collateral Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall be deemed to have complied with its obligations under the Indenture and may retain any remaining Collateral Excess Proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations tendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds, the Trustee, subject to DTC customary procedures, shall select the Notes and the Company shall select the other Pari Passu Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such other Pari Passu Obligations tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or other Pari Passu Obligations will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Collateral Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any remaining Collateral Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Collateral Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Collateral Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale of non-Collateral, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to repay: (a) Obligations under any Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (and if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), provided that the Company shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under “Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof or, if less, the accreted value thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof or, if less, the accreted value thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; or (b) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary; _provided, that in the case of clause (a) above, (i) if an offer to purchase any Indebtedness of the Company or any_ Restricted Subsidiary is made, such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the amount of such offer, 171 ----- whether or not accepted by the holders of such Indebtedness, and no Net Proceeds in the amount of such offer will be deemed to exist following such offer, and (ii) if the holder of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary declines the repayment of such Indebtedness owed to it from such Net Proceeds, such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the declined Net Proceeds; (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other properties or assets, in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business; (3) to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) other assets that, in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or other assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or (4) any combination of the foregoing; _provided that, in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted_ application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (or, if later, 365 days after the receipt of such Net Proceeds); provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Proceeds will be applied (whether or not repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant. Any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Net Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase Notes, as described in clause (1) above, will be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $40.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders and, at the option of the Company, to any holders of any Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”) (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is at least $2,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, or 100% of the accreted value thereof, if less, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, (or, in respect of such Pari _Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Pari Passu_ 172 ----- Indebtedness) to, but not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Company will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within thirty Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $40.0 million by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Net Proceeds by making an Advance Offer with respect to the Advance Portion in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $40.0 million or less. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to compliance with other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be purchased in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice” below. Selection of such Pari _Passu Indebtedness will be made pursuant to the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness. Upon completion of any_ such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Pending the final application of any Collateral Net Proceeds or Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Collateral Net Proceeds or Net Proceeds may apply such Collateral Net Proceeds or Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Collateral net Proceeds or Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer or an Asset Sale Offer, as applicable. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Senior Credit Facilities will prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

In the event that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) (a) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events and (b) the Company or any of its Affiliates enters into an agreement to effect a transaction that would result in a Change of Control and one or more of the Rating Agencies indicate that if consummated, such transaction (alone or together with any related recapitalization or refinancing transactions) would cause such Rating Agency to withdraw its Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the ratings assigned to the Notes below Investment Grade Rating, then the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenant referenced in clause (8) of the immediately preceding paragraph under the Indenture with respect to future events, including without limitation, the proposed transaction described in this clause (b). The period beginning on the day of a Covenant Suspension Event and ending on a Reversion Date is called a “Suspension Period.” On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date (or thereafter) under any Suspended Covenant solely as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, or events occurring, during the Suspension Period. On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period (and not in contemplation of the Reversion Date) so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. 175 ----- For purposes of the “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero. For purposes of the “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” covenant, on the Reversion Date, any contractual encumbrances or restrictions of the type specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) of that covenant entered into during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been in effect on the Issue Date, so that they are permitted under clause (a) under “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.” For purposes of the “—Transactions with Affiliates” covenant, any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to a contract, agreement, loan, advance or guaranty with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company entered into during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been in effect as of the Issue Date for purposes of clause (6) under “—Transactions with Affiliates.” Within 10 days following the Reversion Date any Guarantees released solely upon the related Covenant Suspension Event shall be reinstated and the Company must comply with the terms of the covenant under “—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.” There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings. The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate notifying it of the commencement or termination of any Suspension Period.

The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee, in writing, to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture will provide that the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required, within five Business Days, after becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we, an initial purchaser or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and/or holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers.

Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants.

Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Indirect access to the DTC system is available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly.

Background and Basis of Presentation:",103.10.1,,"PQ Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) conducts operations through three principal businesses: Performance Chemicals: a fully integrated, global leader in silicate technology, producing sodium silicate, specialty silicas, zeolites, spray dry silicates, magnesium silicate, and other high performance chemical products used in a variety of end-uses such as adsorbents for surface coatings, clarifying agents for beverages, cleaning and personal care products; Catalysts: an integrated silica catalyst and specialty zeolite-based catalyst producer with leading global market positions, producing silica catalyst used in the production of high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”), and specialty zeolite-based catalysts sold to the emissions control industry, the petrochemical industry and other areas of the broader chemicals industry; and Specialty Glass Materials: a leading global producer of engineered glass products for use in highway safety, polymer additives, metal finishing and electronics end markets, which is comprised of Highway Safety and Engineered Glass Materials (“EGM”). Highway Safety manufactures glass beads used for airport, highway and road safety applications to improve visibility in wet and nighttime driving conditions, where EGM produces solid and hollow glass spheres for use as polymer additives and fillers in specialized plastics, as engineered peening beads in metal finishing and as conductives in consumer electronics and other applications. We experience some seasonality, primarily with respect to the Specialty Glass Materials business. As the road striping season occurs during warmer weather, sales and earnings are generated primarily during the second and third quarters. Working capital is built during the first half of the year, while cash generation occurs primarily in the second half of the fiscal year. On May 31, 2007, PQ Corporation and its parent company, Niagara Holdings, Inc., entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with affiliates of The Carlyle Group (“2007 Sponsor”), including CPQ Holdings LLC (“CPQ Holdings”),and an affiliate of the previous owner of the Company, J.P. Morgan Partners, pursuant to which PQ Corporation continued as the surviving corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CPQ Holding Corporation, which was a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CPQ Holdings (the “2007 Merger”). The 2007 Merger was consummated on July 30, 2007. On July 2, 2008, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities from and certain stock of the entities that comprised INEOS Silicas, a division of INEOS Group that was a global manufacturer of inorganic chemicals based on silica and alumina technology, from INEOS Capital Partners, formerly named INEOS Investments Partnership (“INEOS”) in exchange for cash and shares of CPQ Holding Corporation (the “2008 INEOS Silicas Acquisition”). After the closing of the 2008 INEOS Silicas Acquisition, INEOS Silicas was incorporated into the Performance Chemicals and Catalyst divisions of the Company. Since July 2, 2008, the financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired business. On January 29, 2014, CPQ Holding Corporation changed its name to PQ Holdings Inc. (“Holdings”). On September 11, 2014, Holdings entered into a stock purchase agreement (as amended on November 18, 2014) pursuant to which affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC (“CCMP” or “2014 Sponsor”) and INEOS, one of the existing stockholders of Holdings, acquired stock of Holdings from CPQ Holdings and certain other selling stockholders (the “2014 Stock Purchase”). The 2014 Stock Purchase was consummated on December 29, 2014. Following consummation of the sale, The Carlyle Group no longer holds any shares of Holdings. The 2014 Stock Purchase did not qualify as a business combination. On August 18, 2015, the Company announced that Eco Services Holdings LLC (“Eco Services”), the Company and certain of their respective affiliates had signed a definitive agreement (the “Business Combination F-8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Borrowings under the first lien term facilities bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate or the base rate elected by the Company at the time of borrowing plus a margin of 4.25% or 3.25%, respectively. Further, the LIBOR or base rate elected under the facilities are also subject to a floor of 1.00% and 2.00%, respectively. The senior credit facility requires minimum quarterly principal payments of $3,050 on the first lien term loan, though such minimum payments may be reduced in accordance with any prepayments or increased if the amount of the Term Loans is increased. On February 15, 2013, the Company re-priced its senior secured terms loans to lower the applicable interest rate and issued the 2013 Term Loans of $1,235,000. The 2013 Term Loans have substantially identical terms to the existing term loans except borrowings under the 2013 Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate or the base rate elected by the Company at the time of borrowing plus a margin of 3.50% or 2.50%, respectively. In addition, the minimum quarterly principal payments increased to $3,088, the maturity date was extended to August 7, 2017, and the prepayment premium of 1.00% will be payable on the 2013 Term Loans in the event of a re-pricing transaction prior to the one year anniversary of the effective date of the 2013 Term Loans. On March 27, 2014, the Company re-priced its senior secured terms loans to lower the applicable interest rate and issued the 2014 Term Loans of $1,222,650. The 2014 Term Loans have substantially identical terms to the existing term loans except borrowings under the 2014 Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate or the base rate elected by the Company at the time of borrowing plus a margin of 3.00% or 2.00%, respectively.

The notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of the Company’ existing and future subordinated debt. The notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s first lien senior secured debt, including the senior secured credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The notes will also be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of PQ Corporation’s existing and future non-guarantor subsidiaries.

The Combined Company will retain the PQ Corporation name. The Company’s existing indirect shareholders (affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC (“CCMP”), affiliates of INEOS Capital Partners and management) and Eco Services’ existing indirect equity holders (affiliates of CCMP and management) will constitute the sole shareholders of the Combined Company immediately following the closing of the business combination. The completion of the transactions is subject to certain closing conditions that are customary for transactions of this type, including regulatory clearance. first-out (“FIFO”) methods. When necessary, the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value, including any costs to sell or dispose. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excessive inventory levels, product deterioration and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. Prepaid and Other Current Assets._ Prepaid and other current assets primarily include prepayments on insurance and property tax, current deposits, income tax receivables, current deferred tax assets, value-added taxes, receivables from affiliates and other current assets. Property, Plant, and Equipment._ Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost and include expenditures for new facilities and major renewals and betterments. The Company capitalizes the cost of furnace rebuilds as part of property, plant and equipment. Plant and equipment under capital leases are carried at the present value of minimum lease payments. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred. The Company capitalizes internal costs associated with the implementation of purchased software. When property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the net carrying amount is eliminated with any gain or loss on disposition recognized in earnings at that time. Depreciation is generally provided on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging up to thirty-three years for buildings, ten to twelve years for machinery and equipment, and three to seven years for computer hardware and software. Investments._ Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment provides us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company’s ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee ranges between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee’s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting, the investments in equity-method investees are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as investments in affiliated companies and the investees’ earnings or losses together with other-than temporary impairments in value is recorded as equity in net income from affiliated companies in the consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill and Intangible Assets._ Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. A write-down occurs in periods in which it is determined that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its book value. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to perform an impairment test at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company can perform a qualitative step zero assessment. If the Company elects to skip or fails the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative assessment on the reporting units is performed. Under a qualitative assessment, the Company will consider the relevant events and circumstances and the extent to which they could affect the comparison of a reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying amount and form a conclusion indicating whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The quantitative assessment is a two-step test. In step one the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, then step two is required. In step two the actual amount of the goodwill impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. See Note 11 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion on goodwill impairment. F-10 ----- Other Long-term Assets._ Other long-term assets primarily include pension benefits, deferred tax assets, and spare parts. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets._ The Company performs an impairment review of property, plant, and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows. When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is found not to be recoverable, then an impairment loss is recognized. Any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. Fair value is determined using quoted market prices where available, or other techniques including discounted cash flows. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance, economic conditions, and technological changes that may affect the future useful lives of the assets. Derivative Financial Instruments._ The Company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to enhance its ability to manage risk, including exposures to interest rates and natural gas price fluctuations that exist as part of ongoing business operations. Derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. All derivatives designated as hedges are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company may designate the derivative as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that the derivative is effective as a hedge, until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item, and the ineffective portion is reported in earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated or does not qualify as a cash flow hedge are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. Cash flows from derivative instruments are reported in the same cash flow category as the cash flows from the items being hedged. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating all derivatives that are designated cash flow hedges to underlying forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item during the period. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, hedge accounting would be discontinued with respect to that derivative prospectively. Fair Value Measurements._ The Company measures fair value using the guidelines under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between market participants. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a market participant, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. See Note 4 to these consolidated financial statements regarding the application of fair value measurements. The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items. See Note 13 to these consolidated financial statements regarding the fair value of debt and Note 15 regarding other financial instruments. F-11 ----- Revenue Recognition._ Revenue, net of related discounts and allowances, is recognized when both title and risk of loss of the product have been transferred to the customer, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Customers take title and assume all the risks of ownership upon shipment (if terms are “FOB shipping point”) or upon delivery (if terms are “FOB destination”). Any deviation from the standard terms and arrangements are reviewed for the proper accounting treatment, and revenue recognition is revised accordingly. The Company recognizes rebates given to customers as a reduction of revenue based on an allocation of the cost of honoring rebates earned and claimed to each of the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer toward earning the rebate. Rebates are recognized at the time revenue is recorded. The Company measures the rebate obligation based on the estimated amount of sales that will result in a rebate at the adjusted sales price per the respective sales agreement. Shipping and Handling Costs._ Amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling, if any, represent revenues earned for the goods provided and is classified as revenue. Costs related to shipping and handling of products shipped to customers are classified as cost of goods sold. Research and Development._ Research and development costs of $10,264, $9,142, and $8,661, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, were expensed as incurred and reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes._ The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to tax filing requirements and audit within these jurisdictions. The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized. In determining the provision for income taxes, the Company provides deferred income taxes on income from foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are taxable upon remittance to the United States. The Company establishes contingent liabilities for possible assessments by taxing authorities resulting from uncertain tax positions including, but not limited to, transfer pricing, deductibility of certain expenses and other state, local, and foreign tax matters. The Company recognizes a financial statement benefit for positions taken for tax return purposes when it will be more-likely-than-not that the positions will be sustained. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax examinations are often complex as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by the Company and may require several years to resolve. These accrued liabilities represent a provision for taxes that are reasonably expected to be incurred on the basis of available information but which are not certain. Asset Retirement Obligation._ The Company records a liability when the fair value of any future obligation to retire a long-lived asset as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance or contract is reasonably estimable. The Company also records a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated. When the liability is initially recorded, the Company capitalizes the cost by increasing the amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the Company adjusts the liability to its present value by recognizing accretion expense as an operating expense in the consolidated statement of F-12 ----- operations each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, the Company records a gain or loss if the actual costs differ from the accrued amount. The Company has recorded asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) in other long-term liabilities in order to recognize legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. The Company has assessed whether an ARO is required at each manufacturing facility and has recorded an obligation for those location for which an obligation exists. The most significant of these are primarily attributable to environmental remediation liabilities associated with current operations that were incurred during the course of normal operations. The Company has AROs that are conditional in nature. The Company identified certain conditional AROs upon which it was able to reasonably estimate their fair value and recorded a liability. These AROs were triggered upon commitments by the Company to comply with local, state, and national laws to remove environmentally hazardous materials. The AROs have been recognized on a discounted basis using a credit adjusted risk free rate. Accretion of the AROs is recorded in other operating expense and amounted to $304, $296, and $305, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Following are changes in the ARO liability during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013: The major elements in determining pension income and expense are pension liability discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The Company references rates of return on high-quality, fixed income investments when estimating the discount rate, and the expected period over which payments will be made based upon historical experience. The long-term rate of return used to calculate the expected return on plan assets is the average rate of return estimated to be earned on invested funds for providing pension benefits. In addition to pension benefits, the Company provides certain health care benefits for employees who meet age, participation and length of service requirements at retirement. These plans were closed to new retirees in the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2006. The Company uses explicit assumptions using the best estimates available of the plan’s future experience. Principal actuarial assumptions include: discount rates, present value factors, retirement age, participation rates, mortality rates, cost trend rates, Medicare reimbursement rates and per capita claims cost by age. Current interest rates, as of the measurement date, are used for discount rates in present value calculations. The Company also has defined contribution plans covering domestic employees of the Company and certain subsidiaries. Contingencies._ Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company and legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability is accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed, including the approximate term, how the guarantee arose, and the events or circumstances that would require the guarantor to perform under the guarantee. Use of Estimates._ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Out of period adjustment._ Included in the 2015 financial statements are certain out of period adjustments relating to errors that originated in 2014 and 2013. During 2015, the Company recorded a $3,064 charge to the provision for income taxes and a corresponding credit to deferred taxes related to an out of period adjustment associated with the accounting for deferred taxes of Convertible Preferred Equity Instrument (CPEC), a hybrid equity instrument. The Company has determined that the impact of these out of period adjustments were not material to any of the years presented. F-14 ----- Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt the requirements of this standard as of December 31, 2015. In accordance with ASU 2015-03, the Company has presented net deferred financing costs of $4,228 and $6,141 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a direct reduction of long term debt. In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating _the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Under this ASU, an entity will no longer be allowed to separately disclose_ extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or transaction is unusual in nature and occurs infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted ASU 2015-01 effective December 31, 2015. The adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance ASU 2015-08 that provides companies with the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. The acquired entity may elect the option to apply pushdown accounting in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs. If pushdown accounting is not applied in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs, an acquired entity will have the option to elect to apply pushdown accounting in a subsequent reporting period as a change in accounting principle under GAAP. If pushdown accounting is applied to an individual change-in-control event, that election is irrevocable. This guidance also requires an acquired entity that elects the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements to disclose information in the current reporting period that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the effect of pushdown accounting. The Company has adopted this guidance effective November 18, 2014, as the amendments are effective upon issuance. The adoption of this new guidance did not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the issuance of the financial statements. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosures would be required. This guidance will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued accounting guidance that will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The core principle of the guidance is that revenue recognized from a transaction or event that arises from a contract with a customer should reflect the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services provided. To achieve that core principle the new guidance sets forth a five-step revenue recognition model that will need to be applied consistently to all contracts with customers, except those that are within the scope of other topics in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). Also required are enhanced disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. The enhanced disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments made in applying the revenue guidance, and assets recognized related to the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. These new requirements for nonpublic entities become effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. A nonpublic entity may elect early application, but no earlier than December 15, 2017, the effective date for public entities. The Company is assessing the impact of these new requirements on our financial statements. F-16 ----- In April 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance amending existing requirements for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, discontinued operations reporting will be limited to disposal transactions that represent strategic shifts having a major effect on operations and financial results. The amended guidance also enhances disclosures and requires assets and liabilities of a discontinued operation to be classified as such for all periods presented in the financial statements. Public entities will apply the amended guidance prospectively to all disposals occurring within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014 and interim periods within those years. The Company has adopted this standard on January 1, 2015. Due to the change in requirements for reporting discontinued operations described above, presentation and disclosures of future disposal transactions after adoption may be different than under current standards. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11 Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net _Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. This update is intended_ to improve the consistency surrounding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward exists, requiring the unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. The new requirements for nonpublic entities are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2014, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company has implemented the provisions of ASU 2013-11 in 2015. The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows: derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as forward contracts, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. The Company has interest rate caps and natural gas caps and swaps that are fair valued using Level 2 inputs. In addition, the Company applies a credit valuation adjustment to reflect credit risk which is calculated based on credit default swaps. To the extent that the Company’s net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset the Company utilizes the counterparty’s default swap rate. If the net exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability the Company utilizes a default swap rate comparable to PQ Holdings Inc. The credit valuation adjustment is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume the Company’s liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for the Company’s assets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 the credit valuation adjustment resulted in a minimal change in the fair value of the derivatives. The following table presents the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, by component for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Amounts in parentheses indicate debits. The following table presents the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Amounts in parentheses indicate debits to profit / loss. The Company had net receivables due from affiliates of $4,410 and $3,407 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are included in prepaid and other current assets. Net receivables due from affiliates are generally non-trade receivables. Sales to and purchases from affiliates were not material for the years presented. On December 18, 2013, PQ Corporation and our joint venture, Zeolyst International, entered into a real estate tax abatement agreement with the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas that will utilize an Industrial Revenue Bond financing structure to achieve a 75% real estate tax abatement on the value of the improvements that will be constructed during the expansion of PQ Corporation’s and Zeolyst International’s facilities at the jointly-operated Kansas City, Kansas plant. In accordance with ASC 210-20-45, the financing obligation and the industrial bond receivable have been presented net. was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on management’s assessment of a number of factors including the reporting unit’s recent performance against budget as well as management’s ability to execute on planned future strategic initiatives. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in those future cash flows. At October 1, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of each of the five reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, step two was not required. The Company has trade names that are not subject to amortization of $104,415 and $108,972 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in trade names during the year was due to the foreign currency impact. The Company performed an annual quantitative assessment on its intangibles not subject to amortization and concluded that no impairment charge was warranted. Gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization for intangible assets with estimable useful lives are as follows: $1,235,000 (the “2013 Term Loans”). The Company incurred early debt repayment fees of $12,200, of which $6,508 was recorded as original issue discount to long-term debt and $5,692 was immediately written off as debt extinguishment costs. The Company also recorded $1,771 of new third party financing costs as deferred financing fees. In addition, previous unamortized deferred financing costs of $2,592 and original issue discount of $11,993 associated with the old debt were written off as debt extinguishment costs. On March 27, 2014, the Company re-priced its senior secured terms loans to lower the applicable interest rate. The Company repaid all outstanding senior secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $1,222,650 including accrued interest of $2,971 and issued new senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,222,650 (the “2014 Term Loans”). The 2014 Term Loans have substantially identical terms to the existing term loans except borrowings under the 2014 Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate or the base rate elected by the Company at the time of borrowing plus a margin of 3.00% or 2.00%, respectively. In addition, a prepayment premium of 1.00% will be payable on the 2014 Term Loans in the event of a re-pricing transaction prior to the one year anniversary of the effective date of the 2014 Term Loans. The Company recorded $536 of new creditor fees as original issue discount in long-term debt. In addition, previous unamortized deferred financing costs of $264 and original issue discount of $2,212 associated with the old debt were written off to debt extinguishment costs. The Company incurred deferred financing fees associated with the financing of its debt. Such deferred financing costs are amortized over the terms of the related agreements. Amortization of deferred costs of $1,913, $1,967, and $1,892, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were included in interest expense. In addition, the Company paid original issue discount associated with the financing of its debt. The original issue discount is amortized over the terms of the related agreements. Amortization of original issue discount of $6,822, $6,932, and $7,535, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were included in interest expense. The loans and guarantees under the senior credit facility are secured by first-priority liens in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of PQ Corporation and certain of its material subsidiaries, including pledges of all present and future shares of capital stock of PQ Corporation and certain guarantors and each of PQ Corporation’s and such guarantors’ material directly wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the present and future shares of capital stock of each of PQ Corporation’s and such guarantors’ directly owned foreign restricted subsidiaries (other than certain Cayman subsidiaries which guarantee the senior credit facility), in each case subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and customary permitted liens. The senior credit facility further requires prepayments from all “net cash proceeds” received and “excess cash flow,” if applicable. In accordance with the senior credit facility, net cash proceeds generally relate to proceeds received from the issuance or incurrence of certain indebtedness or proceeds received on the disposition of assets, adjusted for certain costs and expenses, and are payable promptly upon receipt, subject in the case of net cash proceeds from asset dispositions, to meeting the thresholds described below. Net cash proceeds in respect of asset dispositions are not payable if such proceeds are reinvested in the Company’s business within a certain specified time period or if they are under certain minimum amounts, both on an individual basis for any given disposition and in the aggregate for dispositions that, individually, would not meet the threshold. Excess cash flow is to be calculated annually and is defined as consolidated net income adjusted for various expenditures and/or proceeds commencing with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2014. Prepayments with respect to excess cash flow, if any, are to be made on an annual basis due within 10 days after the annual audited financials are delivered to the lenders thereunder of each year. The detailed calculations supporting those two prepayments are defined in the credit agreement. The remaining principal balance of the term loans are due upon maturity. The senior credit facility provides for up to $150,000 in revolving credit borrowings. Borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR or base rate elected by the Company at the time of borrowing plus a margin of 4.25% or 3.25%, respectively, subject to reduction based on certain leverage thresholds. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee equal to 0.50%, with a step-down to 0.25% based on certain leverage thresholds of the unused revolving credit borrowings available under the senior credit facility. Revolving credit borrowings are payable at the option of the Company throughout the term of the senior credit facility with the balance due May 8, 2017. As of December 31, 2015, there were no revolving credit borrowings under the senior credit facility. In accordance with the terms of the Company’s senior credit facility, repayments made by the Company relating to outstanding revolver borrowings are applied to all lenders on a pro-rata basis, subject to certain exceptions. The senior credit facility contains various non-financial restrictive covenants. It limits the ability of PQ Corporation and its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain indebtedness or liens, merge, consolidate or liquidate, dispose of certain property, make investments or declare or pay dividends, make optional payments, modify certain debt instruments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or enter into certain sales and leasebacks, and it also provides limitation on other non-financial restrictive covenants. The Senior Credit Facility also contains one financial restrictive covenant. Commencing at the end of the first full fiscal quarter after the effective date of the Agreement, which was November 8, 2012, as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company for the four fiscal quarter period ending on such date, the Company’s Total Net First Lien Leverage Ratio, as defined, must be less than 5.75:1.00 (4.75:1.00 as of December 31, 2015), with annual step-downs. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants. The Company may at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay the senior secured loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty, except prior to the one year anniversary of the closing date, the Company shall pay a prepayment premium in an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount prepaid. F-29 ----- The Company has a $35,000 letter of credit sublimit under the senior credit facility subject to the availability under the revolving credit facility. The Company has letters of credit outstanding of $5,279 as of December 31, 2015, which reduce available borrowings under the revolving credit facility by such amounts. Texas (the “NMTC Agreement”). The NMTC program, which is administered by the United States Treasury Department requires certain balance sheet commitments. The NMTC Agreement will provide the Company with certain monetary benefits as an offset to specifically identified capital expenditures. The NMTC Agreement requires that certain commitments and covenants be maintained over the course of the next 7 years, in order to legally recognize the benefit. Chase agreed to contribute $6,634 and an additional $15,632 in funds lent to Chase by Potters Holdings II, L.P. to TX CDE. TX CDE, in turn, lent $21,000 in the form of $5,368 and $15,632 notes, or the Loans, to Potters, which used the proceeds of the Loans to finance the expansion of Potters’ manufacturing facility in Paris, Texas. The capital expenditures associated with the NMTC Agreement were completed in 2014. The $21,000 was outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. In connection with the NMTC transaction, the Company has provided an indemnification related to our actions or inactions which cause either a NMTC disallowance or recapture event. In the event that we cause either a recapture or disallowance of the tax credits expected to be generated under this program, then we will be required to repay the disallowed or recaptured tax credits plus an amount sufficient to pay the taxes on such repayment, to the counterparty of the agreement. This indemnification covers our actions and inactions prior to September 6, 2020. The maximum potential amount of future payments under this indemnification is approximately $12,600. The Company currently believe that the likelihood of us being required to make a payment under this indemnification is remote. The Company also has several note payable agreements denominated in Japanese Yen which currently enables the Company to borrow up to a total of 260,000 Japanese Yen, or $2,158. Borrowings bear interest at either TIBOR (“Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate”) plus a margin or the short-term prime rate with a weighted average rate of 0.63% as of December 31, 2015 and as of December 31, 2014. The terms of the agreements vary and are renewable upon expiration of the term with the balances due in 2016. Borrowings under the agreement are payable at the option of the Company throughout the term of the agreements. Borrowings outstanding under these agreements were $2,158 and $2,184 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain other note payable agreements. These agreements are not further described as they are not significant to the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the senior secured term loan and senior secured bond was lower than book value by $30,760 and $3,206, respectively. The fair value of the senior secured term loans and notes were derived from published loan prices at December 31, 2015 and 2014, as applicable. The fair value is classified as Level 1 based upon the fair value hierarchy and is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities. The aggregate long-term debt maturities are: Cash payments for interest were $103,108, $104,917, and $109,337, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. income (loss), net of tax. Realized gains and losses on natural gas hedges are included in production cost and subsequently charged to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which inventory is sold. Use of Derivative Financial Instruments to Manage Interest Rate Risk._ The Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on the long-term senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility. Changes in interest rates will not affect the market value of such debt but will affect the amount of our interest payments over the term of the loans. Likewise, an increase in interest rates could have a material impact on the Company’s cash flow. The Company hedges the interest rate fluctuations on debt obligations through interest rate cap agreements. The Company records these agreements at fair value as assets or liabilities. As the derivatives are highly effective and are designated and qualify as cash-flow hedges, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Fair value is determined based on estimated amounts that would be received or paid to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on quoted market prices. During 2013, the Company entered into interest rate cap agreements, paying a premium of $995 to mitigate interest rate volatility from September 2013 until March 2016, by employing a 2% cap rates on $800,000 of notional variable debt. The fair values of derivative instruments held are shown below: The following table shows the effect of the Company’s derivative instruments designated as hedges on other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) and the statement of income: A reconciliation of income tax expense (benefit) at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% to actual income tax expense (benefit) is as follows: Deferred tax assets (liabilities) are comprised of the following: Deferred tax assets: Following are changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013: Included in the balance of total unrecognized tax benefits are potential benefits of $19,419 and $15,503, that if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest and penalties recognized related to uncertain tax positions amounted to ($1,313), $976 and $152 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period for which the event occurs requiring the adjustment. The accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are $3,131 and $5,843, respectively, and are recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The following describes the open tax years, by major tax jurisdiction, as of December 31, 2015: $461,980. A valuation allowance of $12,789 has been applied against the total $18,511 of state net operating loss deferred tax assets, leaving losses of $5,722 that have been recognized for financial accounting purposes for the portion of those losses that the Company believes, on a more likely than not basis, will be realized. Foreign net operating losses of $43,287, of which $14,563 will begin to expire in 2029 and the remaining $28,724 carried forward indefinitely, are available to reduce future foreign income taxes payable. A valuation allowance of $10,046 has been applied to $10,622 of deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carry-forwards, leaving a net deferred tax asset relating to foreign net operating losses of $576 that have been recognized for financial accounting purposes. Cash payments (refunds) for income taxes are as follows: Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of: Significant weighted average assumptions used in determining the pension obligations include the following: publicly traded equity securities and mutual funds. These securities (or the underlying investments of the funds) are actively traded and valued using quoted prices for identical securities from the market exchanges. - Level 2—Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from those willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for the term of the instrument. Such inputs include market interest rates and volatilities, spreads and yield curves. Level 2 assets primarily consist of fixed-income securities and comingled funds that are not actively traded or whose underlying investments are valued using observable marketplace inputs. The fair value of plan assets invested in fixed-income securities is generally determined using valuation models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields, lowvolume market quotes and quoted prices for similar assets. Plan assets that are invested in comingled funds are valued using a unit price or net asset value (“NAV”) that is based on the underlying investments of the fund. - Level 3—Certain inputs are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what hypothetical market participants would use to determine a transaction price for the asset or liability at the reporting date. Level 3 assets include investments covered by insurance policies and real estate funds valued using significant un-observable inputs. The changes in the level 3 pension plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: The estimated net actuarial loss (gain) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into benefits cost in 2016 is $216 for our defined benefit supplementary retirement plans. The accumulated benefit obligation of our defined benefit supplemental retirement plans for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $14,128 and $15,019, respectively. The discount rate used in determining the supplemental retirement plan pension obligations was 4.00% and 3.60% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The discount rate used in determining net periodic benefit cost was 3.60%, 4.30%, and 3.30%, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The rate of compensation increase for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, was zero as all future accruals were frozen for the defined supplemental retirement plans as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with the plan amendment approved in 2005. The Company expects to contribute $1,168 to the defined benefit supplementary retirement plans in 2016. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid: Components of net periodic benefit cost consist of: There are no expected Medicare subsidy receipts expected in future periods. Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain other postretirement benefit plans that are consistent with statutory practices. These plans are not included in the disclosures above as they are not significant to the consolidated financial statements. Activity of nonvested shares of restricted Class D common stock granted under the Company’s Stock Incentive Plan is shown below The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the restricted Class D common stock granted during 2015 was $160.71. of the purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired at their respective fair values with the remaining 6.6% recorded at the Continuing Stockholders’ historical book values as of the date of the acquisition. As a result of the carryover of the Continuing Stockholders’ historical basis, stockholders’ equity (deficit) of PQ Holdings Inc. has been reduced by $53,532. In connection with the 2014 Stock Purchase, Class C and Class D shares were authorized and issued. Class C and Class D shares are identical to Class A and Class B shares, respectively, except they do not have voting rights. facilities. The amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for remediation costs of known PCB painted structures were $1,000 and $2,935, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are recorded as other operation expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In 2011, the Company installed a Continuous Emissions Monitor (“CEM”) to measure CO, NOx and Opacity emissions from a furnace at our Chester facility in Pennsylvania. Since this time, the Company has conducted Relative Accuracy Test Audits (“RATA”) as part of its efforts to certify the CEM. On May 5, 2014, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“PADEP”) officially notified the Company that it was certifying the CEM based on RATA test results dating back to November 2011 and to start entering data previously recorded by the CEM into the Agency’s on-line database. During the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company officially entered data recorded from the CEM up until the second quarter of 2013. On January 8, 2015, the Environmental Program Manager for the Southeast Regional Office Air Quality Program of PADEP notified the Company that it would like to meet to discuss penalty calculations associated with CO and NOx emissions based on the CEM data. The penalty amount starting with fourth quarter 2011 through the second quarter 2013 indicated in PADEP’s communication to the Company totals to $1,489. The Company is planning to meet with PADEP to propose significant reductions in the penalty amounts cited by the Agency. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has recorded a reserve of $1,700 and $1,489, respectively, associated with the PADEP penalty and is recorded as other operation expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As part of the 2008 INEOS Silicas Acquisition, the Company acquired a manufacturing facility at Warrington, United Kingdom. Asbestos-containing building material is present at the site, and asbestos removal and insulation replacement initiatives are underway. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has recorded a reserve of $639 and $671, respectively, for costs related to this program. In 2008, the Company sold the property of a manufacturing facility located in the United States to the local port authority. In 2009, the port authority commissioned an environmental investigation of portions of the property. In 2010, the port authority advised the Company of alleged soil and groundwater contamination on the property and alleged the Company liable for certain conditions. The Company received and reviewed the environmental investigation documentation and determined it may have liability with respect to some, but not all, of the alleged contamination. Respective legal counsel for the Company and the Port of Tacoma are currently engaged in efforts to negotiate the terms of a cost sharing agreement for the funding of additional study and subsequent abatement work to the extent necessary for the site. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has recorded a reserve of $707 and $728, respectively, for costs related to this potential liability. As part of the 2008 INEOS Silicas Acquisition, the Company is liable for potential multi-year UK tax benefits. The Company is contractually obligated to make a payment on an annual basis on its UK taxable results, which can fluctuate period to period, until there is a change in control, as defined in the purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has accrued $5,385 and $6,457, respectively, for this matter representing the expected payment owed on the calculation of the liability for the tax year ended 2015 and 2014. The Company recorded these expenses as transaction related costs in other operating expense, net. The Company has entered into various lease agreements for the rental of office and plant facilities and equipment, substantially all of which are classified as operating leases. Total rent expense under these agreements was $14,551, $13,476, and $10,939, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. F-52 ----- Total rent due under non-cancelable operating lease commitments are: the 2007 Merger. In addition, the Company agreed to pay an annual monitoring fee equal to $2,000. In conjunction with the 2008 INEOS Silicas Acquisition, the consulting agreement was amended whereby the Company agreed to increase the annual monitoring fee equal to $3,000, which was recorded in other operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. TC Group IV, L.L.C. assigned the consulting agreement to Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., another affiliate of The Carlyle Group on June 7, 2012. PQ Holdings Inc., INEOS, and PQ Corporation entered into a consulting agreement relating to the provision of certain financial and strategic advisory services and consulting services. The Company paid a one-time fee in the amount of $6,000 on July 2, 2008 for structuring the 2008 INEOS Silicas Acquisition. In addition, the Company agreed to pay an annual monitoring fee equal to $2,000, which was recorded in other operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. In conjunction with the 2014 Stock Purchase, PQ Holdings Inc., CCMP, and PQ Corporation entered into a consulting agreement relating to the provision of certain financial and strategic advisory services and consulting services. Similarly, the consulting agreement between PQ Holdings, INEOS, and PQ Corporation was amended and restated. Under the new consulting agreements, the Company agreed to pay an annual monitoring fee of $5,000 distributed to CCMP and INEOS equal to the Pro Rata Percentage, as defined, between CCMP and INEOS, which was recorded in other operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “ZI Partnership Agreement”) in 1988 with CRI Zeolites Inc., a Royal Dutch Shell plc affiliate, to form Zeolyst International, our 50/50 joint venture partnership (the “Partnership”). Under the terms of the ZI Partnership Agreement, the Partnership leases certain land used in its Kansas City production facilities from PQ Corporation. This lease, which has been recorded as an operating lease, provided for rental payments of $265, $250, and $235 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The terms of this lease are evergreen as long as the Partnership agreement is in place. The Partnership purchases certain of its raw materials from the Company and is charged for various manufacturing costs incurred at the Company’s Kansas City production facility. The amount of these costs charged to the Partnership during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $14,551, $14,284, and $13,044, respectively. Certain administrative, marketing, engineering, management-related, and research and development services are provided to the Partnership by the Company.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:,103.12.1,,"Principles of Consolidation._ The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies are recorded at cost plus the Company’s equity in their undistributed earnings. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies are translated to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Adjustments resulting from translation of the balance sheets and intercompany loans, which are considered permanent, are included in stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Adjustments resulting from translation of certain intercompany loans, which are not considered permanent and are denominated in foreign currencies, are included in other expense (income), net in the consolidated statement of operations. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Net foreign exchange included in other expense, net was a loss of $21,059, $23,387, and $4,414 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The foreign currency losses realized in 2015, 2014, and 2013, were primarily driven by the non-permanent intercompany debt denominated in local currency translated to U.S. dollars. Cash and Cash Equivalents._ Cash and cash equivalents include investments with original terms to maturity of 90 days or less from the time of purchase. Restricted Cash._ Restricted cash, which is restricted as to withdrawal or usage, is classified separately from cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. The proceeds from the New Markets Tax Credit (“NMTC”) financing arrangement are restricted for use and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet as a noncurrent asset. As of December 31, 2013, there remained $16,890 restricted cash that is required to be used to fund the capital expenditure associated with the NMTC agreement and is recorded in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. During 2014, the balance was fully used to fund the capital expenditure associated with the NMTC agreement. See Note 13 to these consolidated financial statements for further information. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts._ Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. A specific reserve for bad debt is recorded for known or suspected doubtful accounts receivable. For all other accounts, the Company recognizes a reserve for bad debt based on the length of time receivables are past due and historical write-off experience. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Inventories._ All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. All domestic inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method, and all other inventories are valued on the average cost and first-in, F-9 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Expenditures that result from the remediation of an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Liabilities are recognized for remedial activities when the remediation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of expenditures for environmental remediation are recognized as assets only when recovery is deemed probable. See Note 20 to these consolidated financial statements regarding commitments and contingencies and Note 12 regarding the accrued environmental reserve. Stock-Based Compensation._ The Company applies the fair value based method to account for stock options and awards. See Note 18 to these consolidated financial statements regarding compensation expense associated with stock options and awards. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits._ The Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover employees in the United States and Canada, as well as certain employees in other international locations. Benefits for a majority of the plans are based on average final pay and years of service. Our funding policy, consistent with statutory requirements, is based on actuarial computations utilizing the projected unit credit method of calculation. Not all defined benefit pension plans are funded. In the United States and Canada, the pension plans’ assets include equity and fixed income securities. In our other international locations, the pension plans’ assets include equity and fixed income securities, as well as insurance policies. Certain assumptions are made regarding the occurrence of future events affecting pension costs, such as mortality, withdrawal, disablement and retirement, changes in compensation and benefits, and discount rates to reflect the time value of money.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:",103.19.1,,"In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for most leases but will recognize expenses similar to current lease accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2015-17, Balance _Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance provides companies with the option to classify deferred tax_ liabilities and assets as non-current amounts, in a classified statement of financial position. For a particular tax paying component of an entity within a particular tax jurisdiction, all deferred tax liabilities and assets, as well as any related valuation allowance, shall be offset and presented as a single non-current amount. These new requirements for nonpublic entities become effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods with annual reporting periods after December 15, 2018. A nonpublic entity may elect early application as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. The Company has elected to adopt the requirements of this standard as of December 31, 2015. In accordance with ASU 2015-17, in the December 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet, the Company credited the current deferred tax asset by $8,076 and debited the current deferred tax liability by $6, concurrently debiting the non-current deferred tax asset and the non-current deferred tax liability by $1,653 and $6,417, respectively. In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance that will change the requirements for reporting measurement period adjustments to provisional amounts initially recognized in conjunction with a business combination. Under GAAP, an acquiring entity currently is required to retrospectively adjust, in prior period financial statements, the provisional amounts to reflect new information obtained during the measurement period (a period, which may not exceed one year from the date of the business combination, during which the acquiring entity may receive information about the facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date). Under the new guidance, adjustments to the provisional amounts will be reflected in the financial statements for the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined, including by recognizing in current period earnings the full effect of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects. The guidance requires that the acquiring entity either present separately on the face of the current period income statement or disclose in the notes to the current period financial statement, by line item, the amount of the adjustments made during the current period. The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance (ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt _Issuance Costs) that requires deferred financing costs to be presented as a direct reduction from the related debt_ liability in the financial statements rather than as a separately recognized asset, as is the current requirement under U.S. GAAP. Under the new guidance, amortization of such costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2015-15 Presentation and Subsequent _Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements) to include similar treatment_ for deferred financing costs associated with line of credit arrangements. The new guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and must be adopted on a retrospective basis. F-15 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361
1235_1,Offerings 2016.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.22,4. Fair Value Measurements:,103.22.1,,"Fair values are based on quoted market prices when available. When market prices are not available, fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating current market inputs for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality. In instances where there is little or no market activity for the same or similar instruments, the Company estimates fair value using methods, models and assumptions that management believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment which becomes significant with increasingly complex instruments or pricing models. Where appropriate, adjustments are included to reflect the risk inherent in a particular methodology, model or input used. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value have been classified based upon a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest ranking to fair values determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest ranking to fair values determined using methodologies and models with unobservable inputs (Level 3). The classification of an asset or a liability is based on the lowest level input that is significant to its measurement. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: - Level 1—Values are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets accessible at the measurement date. Active markets provide pricing data for trades occurring at least weekly and include exchanges and dealer markets. - Level 2—Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from those willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for the term of the instrument. Such inputs include market interest rates and volatilities, spreads and yield curves. - Level 3—Certain inputs are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what hypothetical market participants would use to determine a transaction price for the asset or liability at the reporting date.

The Company accounted for the acquisition of these assets in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations.” Under the purchase method of accounting, the acquired assets were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was $3,143 and $1,039, respectively, and principally included the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $2,454, inventory of $689, and assumed liabilities of $1,039. The purchase price allocation, which is based on the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, resulted in the Company recording goodwill of $9,896. The Company believes that expected synergies of the acquisition is the primary reason that contributed to a total purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma impact of this acquisition would not have been material to the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The Company completed its annual impairment assessments as of October 1, 2015 and 2014. For the annual assessments, the Company performed the two-step quantitative assessment for each of the reporting units. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit, the Company generally uses a market approach and an income, or discounted cash flow, approach. In 2014, the Company determined fair value of its reporting units using only a market approach. The market value was estimated using publicly traded comparable company values by applying their most recent EBITDA multiples to the reporting unit’s trailing twelve months EBITDA as well as indicative values from the 2014 Stock Purchase. As part of the 2014 Stock Purchase, the Company received bids on the various businesses which were used to value its reporting units as part of the market approach. In 2015, the Company determined fair value of its reporting units using both a market approach and an income, or discounted cash flow, approach. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires various assumptions including the use of projections of future cash flows and discount rates that reflect the risks associated with achieving those cash flows. The key assumptions used in estimating the fair values were the operating margin growth rates, revenue growth rates from implementation of strategic plans, the weighted average cost of capital, the perpetual growth rate, and the estimated earnings market multiples of each reporting unit. The market value was estimated using publicly traded comparable company values by applying their most recent EBITDA multiples to the reporting unit’s trailing twelve months EBITDA.

Financial Instruments:,103.68.1,,"The Company uses interest rate related derivative instruments to manage its exposure related to changes in interest rates on its variable-rate debt instruments and uses commodity derivatives to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates and commodity prices, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is an asset, the counterparty owes the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is a liability, the Company owes the counterparty and, therefore, the Company is not exposed to the counterparty’s credit risk in those circumstances. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties. The derivative instruments entered into by the Company do not contain credit-risk-related contingent features. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a derivative instrument that results from a change in interest rates, currency exchange rates, or commodity prices. The market risk associated with interest rate and commodity price contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. Use of Derivative Financial Instruments to Manage Commodity Price Risk._ The Company is exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly natural gas. The Company has a hedging program in the United States which allows the Company to mitigate exposure to natural gas volatility with natural gas swap agreements. Fair value is determined based on estimated amounts that would be received or paid to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on quoted market prices of comparable contracts. The respective current and non-current liabilities are recorded in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities and the respective current and non-current assets are recorded in prepaid and other current assets and other long-term assets, as applicable.

The valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 was primarily related to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that, in the judgment of management, are not more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies that are prudent in making this assessment. In order to fully realize deferred tax assets, the Company will need to generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced. Management considered certain earnings in non-U.S. subsidiaries to be available for repatriation in the future. The tax cost associated with non-U.S. subsidiary earnings and distributions for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 has been recorded as tax expense for the period. In this regard the Company expects to deduct, rather than credit, foreign tax expense in computing the U.S. tax effects of repatriation from non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2015 and 2014. The unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates that have not been reinvested abroad indefinitely amount to $129,139 as of December 31, 2015. The deferred U.S. federal and state income tax liability and deferred foreign withholding tax liability on these undistributed earnings is estimated to be $49,767. At December 31, 2015, the cumulative unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries outside the United States, considered permanently reinvested, for which no income or withholding taxes have been provided, approximated $94,475. Such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely and, as a result, no deferred tax liability has been recognized with regard to such earnings.

The Company has subsidiaries in various states, provinces and countries that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2003 through 2015. To date, no material adjustments have been proposed as a result of these audits. As of December 31, 2015, the Company does not believe that there are any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. The Company has a net operating loss carry-forward (“NOL”) available of $288,017 to reduce future federal taxes payable. The federal carry-forward period is 20 years. $29,278 relates to periods prior to the 2007 Merger. $258,559 relates to periods after the 2007 Merger but prior to the 2014 Stock Purchase. $180 relates to periods after the 2014 Stock Purchase. Both, the 2007 Merger and 2014 Stock Purchase triggered the change in control provisions under IRC §382. Although subject to the limitations of IRC §382, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the entire $287,837 in pre-transaction NOLs in future years. The remaining $180 relates to NOLs generated following the 2014 Stock Purchase and would not be subject to IRC §382. For state income tax purposes the Company incurred net operating losses of $14,997 for 2015 that may be carried forward at periods ranging from 5 to 20 years among the states in which the Company is subject to tax to reduce future state income taxes payable.

The estimated prior service cost (credit) that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into benefit cost in 2016 is ($149) for the Company’s Other pension plans. The total accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 for the U.S. and Canadian plans was $196,087 and $207,757, respectively.

The model develops a spot rate curve based on the yields available from a broad based universe of high quality corporate bonds. The discount rate is then set as the weighted average spot rate, using the plan’s expected benefit cash flows as the weights. The rate of compensation increase on the U.S. plan was zero for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, as all future accruals were frozen in the United States as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with the plan amendment approved in 2005. The rate of compensation increase in determining the pension obligation on the Canadian plan was 3.50% and 3.75% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The rate of compensation increase in determining the net periodic benefit cost on the Canadian plan was 3.75% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes, and expected future performance. In addition, the Company may consult with and consider the opinions of our external advisors in developing appropriate return benchmarks. The investment objective for the U.S. plan is to generate returns sufficient to meet future obligations. The strategy to meet the objective includes generating attractive returns using higher returning assets such as equity securities and balancing risk using less volatile assets such as fixed income securities. The plan invests in an allocation of assets across the three broadly-defined financial asset categories of equity, fixed income and cash. The target allocations for plan assets are 45 percent equity securities and 55 percent fixed income investments. Similar considerations are applied to the investment objectives of the non-U.S. plans as well as the asset classes available in each location and any legal restrictions on plan investments. The Company categorized plan assets into a Fair Value Hierarchy. The hierarchy consists of three levels as follows: - Level 1—Values are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets accessible at the measurement date. Active markets provide pricing data for trades occurring at least weekly and include exchanges and dealer markets. Level 1 assets primarily include investments in F-42 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

On January 29, 2014, CPQ Holding Corporation changed its name to PQ Holdings Inc. On September 28, 2007, the Company established the CPQ Holding Corporation Stock Incentive Plan, (the “Stock Incentive Plan”). On July 2, 2008, the Stock Incentive Plan was amended. The number of shares that may be issued under the amended Stock Incentive Plan or be subject to awards may not exceed 692,495 shares. In accordance with the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has the authority to issue restricted stock, options, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, and dividends. In 2007 and 2008, the Company issued 355,269 shares of restricted Class A common stock and 895 deferred stock units under the Stock Incentive Plan. In February 2010, the Company issued 340,981 additional shares of restricted Class A common stock under the Stock Incentive Plan, of which a portion of the shares were awarded to certain employees new to the Stock Incentive Plan and a portion of the shares were awarded to certain employees previously awarded shares in 2007 and 2008. The restricted stock includes three separate tranches for vesting purposes; (1) Service shares, (2) Tranche 1 Performance shares, and (3) Tranche 2 Performance shares. The Service shares’ vesting is based on satisfying certain service conditions and the Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 shares’ vesting is based on satisfying certain performance conditions. All of the Service shares vested on certain dates during 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, subject to the employees’ continued service with the Company on such dates. In connection with the 2014 Stock Purchase, the vesting of Tranche 1 Performance shares was modified to provided that those shares will vest as follows: 100% of each grant fully vests on any Measurement Date, as defined in the amendment to the shareholder’s restricted stock agreement, upon CCMP having received Proceeds, as defined, resulting in an MOI, as defined, of at least 2.0, subject to the employee’s continued service with the Company through the vesting date. “MOI” is defined, as of the Measurement Date, as the quotient obtained on or prior to such Measurement Date by dividing (i) the sum of Proceeds received on such Measurement Date and all prior Measurement Dates, by (ii) the Principal Investment. All of the Tranche 2 Performance shares vested when the Company met three specified annual EBITDA targets, subject to the employees’ continued service with the Company on such dates when the EBITDA targets were met. The fair value of the awards was determined using multiples of EBITDA and the income approach, based on discounted free cash flow. In 2015, the Company issued 57,923 shares of restricted Class D common stock and 34,628 shares of Class C options. Both share issuances have various vesting features, including satisfying certain service based and performance based conditions. The fair value of the Class D common stock awards was determined based on the equity valuation from recent transactions. The fair value of the Class C options was determined using a BlackScholes option pricing model. F-49 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

The Company’s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to minimize the possibility of significant environmental impact. The Company is also subject to various other lawsuits and claims with respect to matters such as governmental regulations, labor, and other actions arising out of the normal course of business. No accrual for these matters currently exists, with the exception of those listed below, because management believes that the liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims are not probable or reasonably estimable. The Company triggered the requirement of New Jersey’s Industrial Site Recovery Act (“ISRA”) statute. As required under ISRA, a General Information Notice with respect to the Company’s two New Jersey locations was filed with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) in December 2004 and again in July 2007. Based on an initial review of the facilities by the NJDEP in 2005, the Company estimated that $500 will be required for contamination assessment and removal work at these facilities, and had recorded a reserve for such amount as of December 31, 2005. During subsequent years, it was determined that additional assessment, removal and remediation work would be required and the reserve was increased to cover the estimated cost of such work. In addition, during this period, work had been performed and the reserve was reduced for actual costs incurred for the assessment and remediation work. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has recorded a reserve of $1,625 and $2,039 for costs required for contamination assessment and remediation work at these facilities. The amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and related costs/(benefits) were $0, $(89), and $1,500, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and are recorded as other operation expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There may be additional costs related to soil and ground water remediation, but until further investigation takes place, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of additional liability that may exist. As part of a Delaware River Basin Commission (“DRBC”) required Pollutant Minimization Plan (“PMP”), in July 2013 the Company’s Chester facility conducted limited paint sampling for polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”). Also, as part of demolition, repair and maintenance projects scheduled for the Company’s Baltimore facility in 2014, the Company conducted limited paint sampling during the fall of 2013 for waste categorization purposes. Paint samples were analyzed for PCB Aroclor 1254, the specific PCB congener commonly used in the manufacture of paint until the late 1970s. The Company’s analytical results indicated that PCB Aroclor 1254 is present in paint on some structures (e.g., piping, structural steel, tanks) in excess of the fifty (50) parts per million (“ppm”) regulatory threshold. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), there is no requirement to test in use paint for PCB content. However, once PCB content is identified at concentrations at or above the regulatory threshold, absent specific approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the PCB-containing paint is regulated as an unauthorized use of PCBs, and the paint must be addressed. The Company is preparing to abate painted surfaces that have tested positive for PCBs at levels exceeding 50 ppm in 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a reserve of $2,157 and $2,644 for the anticipated remediation costs of known PCB painted structures at the Company’s Baltimore and Chester F-51 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Under the purchase method of accounting, the acquired assets were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values. The purchase price allocation, which is based on the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, resulted in the Company recording goodwill of $311,892. The Company believes that expected synergies of the acquisition is the primary reason that contributed to a total purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. The Company has historically assessed the impairment of goodwill and the tradename indefinite-lived intangible asset on an annual basis at December 31, and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that book value may exceed fair value. The estimate of fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment related to, among other things, the estimate of the magnitude and timing of future cash flows. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company voluntarily changed its annual impairment assessment date to October 1, for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with its strategic planning process, preparation of its long-term financial budget and cash flow projections and to ensure annual testing occurs within one year of the December 1, 2014 Acquisition. The Company’s management believes that this change in measurement date, which represents a change in method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable under the circumstances, and did not result in the delay, acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge. The Company prospectively applied the change to the annual impairment assessment date beginning October 1, 2015, as there was no impairment assessment performed as of December 31, 2014, as the Acquisition occurred December 1, 2014. As a result of the impairment testing completed as of October 1, 2015, management has determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Certain manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial use. As is typical in the specialty chemicals business, soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past at certain sites and might occur or be discovered in the future at other sites. Investigation and remediation or monitoring soil and groundwater contamination is currently in process at certain of these sites. In addition, the Company is currently involved as a potentially responsible party under federal and state statutes requiring remediation resulting from past waste disposal practices at certain sites, including inactive sites. Currently, the Company is participating in environmental assessments, remedial investigations/feasibility studies and remediation efforts at these and other sites that may involve additional environmental costs in the future. Periodic analyses are performed for environmental risks and the corresponding provisions. The provisions are measured to the best of management’s knowledge and applicable regulations, the nature and extent of the contamination, clean up techniques and other available information. The accrual for environmental liabilities was $4,791 and $5,111 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of which $2,934 and $4,783 were included in noncurrent liabilities, respectively. Environmental liabilities are estimated to be paid out through 2043. The impact of changes to estimated future cash flows is recognized in the provision for environmental reserve in the statement of income. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the discovery of new remedial sites, discovery of new information and scarcity of reliable information pertaining to certain sites, improvements in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations, numerous possible remedial techniques and solutions, difficulty in assessing the involvement of and the financial capability of other potentially responsible parties (including insurers and other indemnities) and the extended time periods over which remediation occurs. As the environmental contingencies are more clearly determined, it is reasonably possible that amounts in excess of those amounts already accrued may be necessary and may be material. Additionally, there is a state mandate to remediate ground soil at one operating site in the event this site is shut down. There are no plans to sell, shut down or otherwise dispose of this site. Therefore, there is an indeterminate settlement date for this potential obligation because the range of time over which it may settle is unknown. Accordingly, a reasonable estimate of the fair value of this potential obligation cannot be made and, as such, an accrual has not been made.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

An analysis is performed of all existing financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis to determine the significance and character of all inputs used to determine their fair value.

A nonpublic entity may elect early application, but no earlier than December 15, 2017, the effective date for public entities. The Company is assessing the impact of these new requirements on its financial statements. In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating _the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Under this ASU, an entity will no longer be allowed to separately disclose_ extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or transaction is unusual in nature and occurs infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted ASU 2015-01 effective December 31, 2015. The adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory”. The standard requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. These amendments do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first out or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out or average cost. The requirements of this standard are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its financial statements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, “Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt _Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements”. As described above, the FASB issued ASU 2015-_ 03, which does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-ofcredit arrangements. ASU 2015-15 adds Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”) paragraphs pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) meeting. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within Update 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, ASU 2015-15 adds language from the EITF that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company has adopted the requirements of this standard as described above. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period _Adjustments”. The standard will change the requirements for reporting measurement period adjustments to_ provisional amounts initially recognized in conjunction with a business combination. Under U.S. GAAP, an acquiring entity currently is required to retrospectively adjust, in prior period financial statements, the provisional amounts to reflect new information obtained during the measurement period (a period, which may not exceed one year from the date of the business combination, during which the acquiring entity may receive information about the facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date). Under the new guidance, adjustments to the provisional amounts will be reflected in the financial statements for the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined, including by recognizing in current period earnings the full effect of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects. The guidance requires that the acquiring entity either present separately on the face of the current period income statement or disclose in the notes to the current period financial statement, by line item, the amount of the adjustments made during the current period. The new guidance for nonpublic entities will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively F-65 ----- to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company has elected to adopt the requirements of this standard as of December 31, 2015. Definite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events indicate a possible loss. Such an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible asset. If the assessment indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the recorded value of the intangible asset, the carrying amount of the intangible asset is reduced by the estimated cash-flow shortfall on a discounted basis, and a corresponding loss is recorded. There were no intangible asset impairments recorded during the periods presented. interest rate adjustment to the Libor interest rate occurring due to a change in reserve requirements as a function of Federal Reserve policy is very low. Although management does not expect the reserve rate to change in the foreseeable future, management will continue to monitor reserve requirements that could result in the embedded derivative having value. Derivative instrument liabilities, if any, are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not the net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date. Many factors are considered in making these assessments, including the progress of the case, opinions or views of legal counsel, prior case law, historical experience or other companies in similar cases, and deemed intent on how to respond. Because litigation and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Legal costs are accrued in advance of when they are incurred when such costs are considered probable and estimable. There is various litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, which include claims for compensation for civil responsibility for chemical products produced. Based on facts currently available and discussion with counsel, management is of the opinion that the disposition of these matters will not materially affect the results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The estimated fair value of capital lease obligations, which fall in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is based on estimated borrowing rates to discount the cash flows to their present value as provided by a broker, or otherwise, quoted, current market prices for same or similar issues. Based on the present value of the cash flows at estimated borrowing rates, the carrying value of the capital leases approximate their fair values. The Acquisition and related transactions were funded with the proceeds of the following transactions: The valuation of the intangible assets acquired and the related amortization periods are as follows: amount of the term loan. The accretion of the original issue discount is reported as interest expense, and is accreted under the effective interest method over the term of the loan. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance on the term loan, net of unamortized original issue discount of $2,159 and unamortized debt issuance costs of $12,655, is $480,186.

There was no significant difference between book value and fair value as of December 31, 2014, as the Senior Notes were issued on December 1, 2014. The fair value is classified as Level 1 based upon the fair value hierarchy and is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities. The Company has accrued severance of approximately $1,293 as of December 31, 2015, for the payment of future postemployment benefits in accordance with its approved plan of termination, related to exiting its former headquarters in Cranbury, New Jersey and relocation to Houston, Texas. Pursuant to the advisory services and monitoring agreement, the Company agreed to pay certain investors a one-time fee of $1,600 for services provided related to the Acquisition. On January 13, 2015, pursuant to a payment direction and subscription agreement, in lieu of the Company paying this fee, these investors agreed to contribute the $1,600 transaction fee to the capital of Holdings. Holdings contributed this fee to Intermediate Holdings. Intermediate Holdings in turn contributed this transaction fee to the Company, increasing the Company’s member’s equity by $1,600. Eco Services incurs certain shared costs, such as electricity, steam, other utility costs and plant administration costs, all of which are charged to Aroma primarily based on direct usage. Eco Services charged out $3,745 and $407 for such expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period December 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, respectively. The expense allocations have been determined on a basis that management considers to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by Solvay’s Eco Services business unit during the periods presented. The allocations may not, however, reflect the expense Solvay’s Eco Services business unit would have incurred as an independent company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if Solvay’s Eco Services business unit had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organization structure, which functions were outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. In accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, during 2015 the Company and Solvay completed its review and concurred on of the calculation of the final accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”). Solvay paid the required difference between the trust-to-trust plan asset transfer, and the final ABO of $14,936, through the transfer of additional funds from its general assets to the Company’s general assets outside of the Plans. The Company then transferred to the Company’s plan trusts an aggregate of $14,936 to settle its estimated liability for the Plans. The following tables summarize changes in the benefit obligation, the plan assets and the funded status of our significant benefit plans as well as the components of net periodic benefit costs, including key assumptions as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, and as of December 31, 2014 and for the period from December 1 to December 31, 2014: Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of: Significant weighted average assumptions used in determining the pension obligations include the following: - Level 2—Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from those willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for the term of the instrument. Such inputs include market interest rates and volatilities, spreads and yield curves. Level 2 assets primarily consist of fixed-income securities and comingled funds that are not actively traded or whose underlying investments are valued using observable marketplace inputs. The fair value of plan assets invested in fixed-income securities is generally determined using valuation models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields, lowvolume market quotes and quoted prices for similar assets. Plan assets that are invested in comingled funds are valued using a unit price or net asset value (“NAV”) that is based on the underlying investments of the fund. - Level 3—Certain inputs are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what hypothetical market participants would use to determine a transaction price for the asset or liability at the reporting date. Level 3 assets include investments covered by insurance policies and real estate funds valued using significant un-observable inputs. contribution to the funds is provided. Defined contribution plan expense was $1,511, $85, $1,848, and $1,956 for the year ended December 31, 2015, for the period from inception (July 30, 2014) to December 31, 2014, for the period January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, and for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,103.163.1,"New Standards, Interpretations and Amendments","Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU’s”) to the FASB’s ASC. Management considers the applicability and impact of all ASU’s. ASU’s not listed were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the financial position or results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for most leases but will recognize expenses similar to current lease accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard’s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosures. These new requirements for nonpublic entities become effective for annual reporting periods F-64 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

Under this method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. To calculate fair value, management used probability-weighted cash flows discounted at rates considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with this type of intangible asset. Management believes that the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions. Cash flows were generally assumed to extend through the duration of customer contracts, including renewal periods as estimated by management. The fair values of the developed technology and permits were estimated using the replacement cost method of the cost approach. For the developed technology, management derived estimated costs necessary to establish current technologies and procedures were considered, including employee cost and time necessary to develop the processes and procedures. For the permits, management estimated the necessary costs to obtain the applicable permits. The fair value of the tradename was estimated using a form of the income approach known as the relieffrom-royalty method. The basic tenet of the relief-from-royalty method is that without ownership of the subject intangible asset, the user of that intangible asset (i.e., Eco Services) would have to make a stream of royalty payments to the owner of the intangible asset in return for the rights to use that asset. By owning or acquiring the intangible asset, the user avoids these royalty payments. Thus, management derived the hypothetical royalty income from the projected revenues of the business, and discounted these streams of cash flows at rates considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with the subject intangible assets.",N/A,as_expected,2016,361

The actual asset allocation for each plan is monitored at least quarterly, relative to the established policy targets and ranges. If the actual asset allocation is close to or out of any of the ranges, a review is conducted. Rebalancing will occur toward the target allocation, with due consideration given to the liquidity of the investments and transaction costs. The objectives of the Company’s investment strategies are as follows. All Plans’ assets are to be held and invested for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries. The Company’s goal is to provide a secure trust fund from which retirement benefits can be paid to employees, as described in the plans, and consistent with prudent management. To meet these requirements, Company contributions to the defined-benefit trust fund are invested with the primary objective of achieving a minimum annualized total return meeting or exceeding the Plans’ current actuarial return assumption. The objectives are accomplished through an investment strategy that includes both domestic and international equities along with fixed-income investments in a mix, which is conducive to participation in rising markets while allowing for protection in falling markets. The target asset allocation of the Hourly Plan assets is 52.40% in fixed income funds, 47.53% in equities, and 0.07% in cash. The target asset allocation of the PEP Plan assets is 44.20% in fixed income funds, 55.72% in equities, and 0.08% in cash. The Company categorized Plans’ assets into a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy consists of three levels as follows: - Level 1—Values are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets accessible at the measurement date. Active markets provide pricing data for trades occurring at least weekly and include exchanges and dealer markets. Level 1 assets primarily include investments in publicly traded equity securities and mutual funds. These securities (or the underlying investments of the funds) are actively traded and valued using quoted prices for identical securities from the market exchanges.
