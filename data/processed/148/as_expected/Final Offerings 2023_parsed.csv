In addition, even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: - the general economic conditions worldwide; - the potential for consumer spending on high-end design products to be replaced by spending on other activities; - our ability to fully realize the Group’s commercial, strategic vision or expected synergies from acquisitions; - our substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill; - our ability to successfully introduce new products, develop our brands and adapt to changing consumer preferences; - significant competition in the development, production and sale of our products; - our ability to effectively control our distribution networks and their commercial practices, and the effect of any disruption in the operations of our distributors or in our relationships with them; - our ability to maintain our relationships with key suppliers of certain raw materials, components or finished products; - any increase in the prices of the raw materials we employ in our manufacturing processes or of the components or finished products we purchase, to the extent we are not able to pass on such price increases to our customers; - our ability to negotiate, maintain and renew license agreements with leading designers on satisfactory terms; - the risk of loss of key license agreements, and the fact that certain of our designers are not subject to non-compete obligations during the terms of their license agreements with us and/ or following the termination thereof; - any negative impact on the reputation of our brand names and designs; - the license agreements we have with designers, which require us to pay royalty and other fees and, in limited cases, to make certain expenditures; - risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates; i ----- - our cost saving measures may prove to be ineffective; - our ability to accurately forecast demand for certain of our products and to adequately manage our product inventory; - any disruptions relating to our manufacturing or assembly facilities or warehouses or to our distribution or delivery processes; - market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential reintroduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, as well as the current political uncertainty in Italy and Europe; - effects and risks of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and other potential epidemics or infectious outbreaks that may have a similar impact; - our ability to continue to retain and attract highly skilled employees, and the risk of loss of key personnel; - production and litigation risks associated with our commercial contract divisions; - our ability to successfully expand into new markets or grow our online presence on a timely basis or at all; - local business risks associated with our presence outside Europe; - risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws, anti-bribery laws and regulations and economic sanction programs; - credit and regulatory risks associated with Louis Poulsen’s B2B division’s activities with public entities; - any system interruptions that impair customer access to our sites, performance failures in our technology infrastructure or data security breaches; - risks related to e-commerce and online revenue as well as online payment methods; - more stringent regulations, including in the area of consumer data privacy; - our ability to implement or maintain adequate monitoring systems or the sufficiency of monitoring systems to prevent the violation of laws and regulations; - seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly results; - the risks that acquisitions may not deliver the expected benefits; - our dependency on good relationships with our joint venture partner and third-party retailers; - the success of our advertising and promotional activities; - our ability to protect our license and other intellectual property rights from others; - labor disputes or work stoppages; - risks associated with certifications by industry standard-setting bodies and applicable law, including the Made in Italy designation; - potential liabilities and costs from litigation and other proceedings; - changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities; - changes in tax laws; - product liability claims; ----- - compliance with environmental health and safety, building permit, zoning and town planning laws and regulations; - the adequacy of our insurance coverage; - credit risks related to some of our customers; - risks of adverse impact to our reputation by social media and influencers; - other risks associated with our financial information, the transaction, our financial profile, the Notes, our structure and the financing; and - other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum. The risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

In accordance with IFRS 9, a financial liability should be removed from the statement of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished; that is, when the obligation specified in the relevant contracts are discharged or cancelled or expired. The accounting treatment of a debt refinancing depends on whether the modified terms (or new debt instrument) are “substantially different” to the previous terms (or debt instrument). We expect the Refinancing will be accounted for as extinguishment of the relevant existing liabilities and will result in the recognition of a new liability at amortized cost.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.8,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,4.8.1,,"This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, in addition to certain of the Issuer’s revenue breakdowns and as adjusted financial information discussed above, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Conversion, Adjusted Net Financial Debt, As Adjusted Cash and Short-term Deposits, As Adjusted Net Financial Debt and As Adjusted Cash Interest Expense, GMV that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. Such non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum are described and defined under “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information _and Other Data—Other Financial and As Adjusted Data”._ In evaluating any EBITDA-based metrics presented herein (including Adjusted EBITDA), you should be aware that, as analytical tools, such metrics are subject to certain limitations. EBITDA-based metrics are not measurements of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you should not consider such metrics as alternatives to (a) gross profit or operating profit (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We present such EBITDA-based metrics as we believe that they are measures commonly used by investors and are measures that we use in managing each of our businesses. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our income (loss) for the year, see “Summary—Summary Historical _Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and As Adjusted Data”._ Adjusted EBITDA as used in this Offering Memorandum is not calculated in the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA” is calculated pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes as described under “Description of Notes” or for purposes of any of our other indebtedness. We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they are widely used by securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe that non-IFRS measures can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we believe that non-IFRS measures are regularly used by the investment community as a means of comparison of companies in our industry. Different companies and analysts may calculate non-IFRS measures differently, so comparisons among companies on this basis should be done carefully. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of our operating result as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to net profit/loss for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; iii ----- - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; - although amortization, depreciation and write-downs are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and certain of these non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; - some of the non-recurring and non-core items that we eliminate in calculating Adjusted EBITDA reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and - they have been calculated by aggregating financial information prepared under different accounting principles and different reporting currencies. Because of these limitations, our non-IFRS measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Consolidated Financial Statements and using these non-IFRS measures only to supplement the evaluation of our performance.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The following chart sets forth a breakdown of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022 by sales channel, giving pro forma effect to the acquisition of Audo as if it had occurred on January 1, 2022: We operate directly or indirectly in more than 130 countries around the world. The following chart sets forth a breakdown of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022 by geography, giving pro forma effect to the acquisition of Audo as if it had occurred on January 1, 2022: Our products are distinguished by their design content, combining innovation and technology with the rich design heritage that characterizes the Italian and Danish traditions. Each of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B maintains a portfolio of iconic products, a number of which have been popular for more than 50 years and were created in collaboration with some of the most prestigious designers in the world, including Antonio Citterio, Gaetano Pesce, Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Philippe Starck, Poul Henningsen and Arne Jacobsen. Our products have received numerous global design awards and are held in the permanent collections of art and design museums worldwide, including in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Le Centre Pompidou in Paris and La Triennale di Milano in Milan. Our Core Brands ----- are complemented by the over 400 brands (including third-party brands) sold by Lumens through its U.S. ecommerce website, the prestigious Fendi Casa brand, which is the result of our joint venture with Maison Fendi, and The Audo, Menu and ByLassen (now merged into the Audo brand), our Nordic-design furniture and lighting brands, which draw upon both historical design archives and collaborations with new designers. Throughout our history, our strong relationships with prestigious designers and our ability to attract up-and-coming design talents coupled with our continuous efforts in technology and product development have enabled us to complement our heritage collection with successful new products that have reinforced the growth of each of our brands over the years. Since our early years of operation, we have also shown attention to sustainability, as demonstrated by the publication of sustainability reports by Flos and B&B since 2015 and 2016, respectively, and by Louis Poulsen since 2019, and the publication of the first Group Sustainability Report in 2021. Sustainability is key to our business and our brands are committed to being recognized as leaders in adopting sustainable policies and practices and in developing a new concept of luxury high-end design that has sustainability at its core. The Group achieved carbon neutrality (scope 1 and 2) in 2020. Our commitment to sustainability is founded on the following three principles: (i) Design for Planet, (ii) Design for People and (iii) Design for Culture.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.1,Leadership position and strong track record of prestigious industry awards in the attractive luxury design market with highly attractive growth prospects,"We are a leading global design company in the highly fragmented and attractive core high-end design market, with €857.3 million in total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA of €218.4 million and net profit of €41.1 million, in each case for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. We believe that we are approximately 1.2 times larger than our closest competitor, almost 2 times larger than our second closest competitor and 3.2 to 3.8 times larger than our third through fifth closest competitors, in each case based on 2022 revenues and our analysis of publicly available financial data for such year. Despite our size, our reference market is highly fragmented. We focus on the luxury segment of the core high-end design market, characterized by rich product heritage, strong and globally recognized brands, iconic products, superior craftmanship, brand exclusivity and premiumness. We estimate our market share to be approximately 4% based on 2022 revenues and our analysis of publicly available financial data for such year, implying a tangible opportunity to further consolidate our market share by expanding in underpenetrated geographies. Many of our brands and products have received various international design accolades and the highest industry awards throughout their history, including 16 Compasso d’Oro awards (including the Compasso d’Oro Product Lifetime Achievement Award awarded to Flos’ Arco lamp in 2020), the first of which in 1955 and the last of which in 2022, NYCxDesign Award, IF Gold Award, IF Design Award, FX Interior Design Awards, Danish Design Award, German Design Award, Elle Deco International Design Award and Lighting Design Award. Our products are held in the permanent collections of art and design museums such as the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Le Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Design Museum in Copenhagen, La Triennale di Milano in Milan and the Today Art Museum in Beijing, confirming the excellence, renown and appeal of our designs. We estimate that in 2022 the luxury design market (a subset of the global luxury market), which is our focus market, represented approximately 63% (valued at approximately €31 billion in that same period) of the total core high-end design market, with the remaining approximately 37% represented by the premium design market (valued at approximately €16 billion in that same period), typically addressed by branded retailers and premium design brands. The global luxury market grew at a CAGR of 6% between 2014 and 2019 and 3% between 2019 and 2022, reaching €1.4 trillion in 2022, while the global core high-end design market grew at a CAGR of 5% between 2014 and 2019 and 7% between 2019 and 2022, notwithstanding a moderate contraction in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The global core high-end design market exceeded pre-pandemic levels already in 2021, reaching €40 billion in such year (compared to €38 billion in 2019 and €35 billion in 2020), continued to grow in 2022, reaching €47 billion, and is estimated to further grow between 2022 and 2026 at a CAGR of between 2% and 5%, reaching approximately €50 to €60 billion in 2026. For 2023, temporary headwinds are expected to affect the global core high-end design market, while the mid-term outlook remains broadly unchanged. Between 2014 to 2022, we outperformed our reference market by increasing our revenues at a CAGR of 9% for each period, which enabled us to reinforce our market positioning, notwithstanding a moderate contraction in 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Our CAGR for these periods was calculated on the basis of like-for-like growth of certain of our acquired brands beginning from the year of their respective acquisition (namely, Flos in 2014, B&B in 2015, Louis Poulsen in 2018 and Lumens in 2021). ----- The growth of the high-end design market is driven by certain structural tailwinds, including (i) the increasing working time that people spend in their homes (estimated to be approximately 3.5 days per week in 2022, compared to approximately 2.6 days per week prior to COVID-19 pandemic), with approximately 98% of workers indicating that they prefer to work remotely, in part due to the change of work habits resulting from the COVID19 pandemic, (ii) the increased use of home offices (with approximately 60% of the people working from home estimated to have a dedicated home office space) and the increasingly important role played by kitchens, which are often considered the heart of the home (with approximately 60% of kitchen renovators having upgraded or added a kitchen island), (iii) the global GDP increase driven by infrastructure renovation (estimated to have contributed approximately 20% of the global GDP growth from 2010 to 2020), (iv) wealth ruralization, which has caused migration of wealth to rural communities and countryside, thereby increasing the demand for high-end design products (with over 50% of adults estimated to prefer living in small towns and rural areas compared to approximately 39% in 2018), and (v) the urbanization trends and associated economic growth in emerging markets, in particular China and India, with an urbanization index estimated to reach approximately 116 and 113, respectively, in 2025 (compared to approximately 100 for both countries in 2016). In addition, the high-end design market is characterized by smaller competitors, making us one of the few design groups that can serve a diverse customer base across a variety of product and service categories and geographies, enabling us to benefit from cross-selling initiatives and giving us the opportunity to grow through selected strategic acquisitions in the segments where we currently operate or in complementary adjacent segments.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.2,Balanced and highly resilient portfolio of iconic designs and new products generating a predictable revenue mix,"Our internationally-acclaimed product portfolios represent a balance between timeless heritage designs and innovative products. Certain iconic designs have become synonymous with our brands and continue to attract significant customer demand decades after being introduced. We believe that maintaining these products in our portfolio helps to limit the effect of market trends and improves our revenue resiliency. Our internal research and product development teams work closely with our designers to continually update and reconfigure iconic pieces to meet the evolving needs and tastes of our customers while maintaining the identity of each of our brands and the distinctive original features that loyal customers worldwide have long associated with our products. Moreover, to further support the success of our most iconic designs and refresh existing and new customers’ interest in our products, from time to time, we also launch new special or limited editions of our heritage products, such as Flos’ Arco K lamp in 2022 with an innovative crystal base, B&B Italia’s Le Bambole x Stella McCartney in 2023, as a result of a collaboration with the renowned English stylist, and PH Pale Rose, a special edition collection of Louis Poulsen’s PH lamps designed in 1926, which we launched in 2022. We also launch new products on an ongoing basis to complement our portfolio of heritage designs and our design portfolio also comprises numerous unexploited heritage designs from prestigious international designers that have not been commercialized before, which we believe represents an important growth opportunity for our Group. For example, we estimate that Louis Poulsen, Audo, B&B and Flos have a significant archive with unexploited designs from heritage designers dating back to the 1950s and 1970s. Between 2020 and 2023, our brands have reintroduced several heritage designs from their archives, including “Camaleonda” and “Scacchi” from B&B Italia, certain versions of “La Lampadina” by Flos, and the “PH Septima Pendant” and “PH 2/2 Question” from Louis Poulsen. Our efforts in research and product development and innovation in both design and technology ensure both the longevity of our iconic products and the continued introduction of creative and successful new designs, all of which ensures a balanced and predictable revenue mix. The following chart sets forth the revenue of B&B Italia, Maxalto, Flos and Louis Poulsen for the year ended December 31, 2022, divided by launch year of the products that these brands sold in such year (i.e. before 2010, between 2010 and 2017 and between 2018 and 2022). ----- Our revenue mix is well balanced relative to the year of launch of the various products we sell in any given period. We believe that such balanced revenue mix, coupled with the significant contribution of made-to-order sales to our total sales, gives us good visibility of our expected revenue streams in the short term (approximately eight weeks for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, providing estimated revenue visibility of approximately two months for our made-to-order products).",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.3,"Unique brand power based on design heritage, iconic products, long-standing relationships with top designers and loyal networks of specifiers in local markets","Our business benefits from significant competitive advantages that make our business model difficult to replicate, including our iconic product portfolio, design heritage, long-standing relationships with top designers and specifiers and strong technical know-how. Our iconic brands benefit from association with a broad base of (i) prestigious and globally renowned designers, such as Mario Bellini, Antonio Citterio, Vincent Van Duysen, Piero Lissoni, Philippe Starck, Jasper Morrison, Gaetano Pesce, Olafur Eliasson, Patricia Urquiola, Nendo, Michael Anastassiades, Konstantin Grcic, Naoto Fukusawa, Barber & Osgerby, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec and Formafantasma; (ii) heritage designers, such as Tobia Scarpa, Poul Henningsen, Arne Jacobsen, Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Gino Sarfatti, Mogens Lassen, Flemming Lassen and Verner Panton; and (iii) talented emerging designers, such as Chiara Andreatti, Anne Boysen, Joris Laarman, Gabriel Tan, Øivind Alexander Slaatto and Peter Mabeo. Many of our designer partners have received multiple awards and recognitions for their designs and have their designs held in the collections of museums around the world. We believe our privileged relationships with renowned designers and our ability to attract new promising designers represent a significant competitive advantage. Some of our designers have collaborated with our brands for many years, creating a strong design relationship and mutual understanding of the needs and preferences of our customer base. Our relationship with designers is mutually beneficial, as it allows us to expand our brand recognition across a wider customer demographic and adds value for the designers, who gain prestige and visibility by working with leading furniture and lighting brands. Designers collaborate closely with our internal research and product development teams, which have accumulated extensive technical expertise and industry knowledge over decades and continually support our design innovation. The research and product development teams add substantial value to designers, providing an extensive knowledge base on product feasibility with respect to design, materials and market success; research on the latest trends, materials and technological innovations; design and development support for concepts, prototypes and molds; negotiation support with suppliers to ensure high component quality standards at competitive prices; and centralized assembly process and production planning. In addition, management teams at each of our brands ensure that any new design that is being proposed or considered internally is fully consistent with the relevant brand’s image and philosophy, which we believe is key to the success of any product and the continued integrity of our brands. In addition to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with world-renowned designers, we also benefit from strong relationships with a widespread network of specifiers, especially smaller, committed professional design and architecture studios that continually choose and promote our products to meet the design needs of their clients. We consider these specifiers, which we define as any party that is involved in the purchasing decision but is not the end user of our products, including but not limited to architects, interior designers, lighting engineers and landscape architects, a loyal and resilient customer intermediary that, through repeat business, provides us ----- with a significant competitive advantage locally in the geographic markets we serve and add to our recognition with end customers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.4,"Diversified business model across product categories, geographies and distribution channels with low customer concentration risk","Our business is well diversified across product categories, geographies and distribution channels. We offer a broad and diversified portfolio of products addressing the full spectrum of our customers’ requirements and we believe we are not dependent on any specific product category. Our product offering is comprised of two product categories, lighting and furniture, which accounted for 64.0% and 34.1% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, giving _pro forma effect to the acquisition of Audo as if it had occurred on January 1, 2022. The lighting category includes our decorative, architectural and outdoor products, which accounted for 27.0%, 11.1% and 5.7% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively). The furniture category includes our living room and bedroom furniture and kitchen products (which accounted for 19.6% and 4.0% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively). Geographically, our business benefits from a balanced and diversified reach, with more than 130 countries served. The United States and Italy, as individual countries, represent the two largest contributors to our sales and accounted for 23.7% and 14.2% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Customers outside of our home geographies of Italy and Denmark generated approximately 79.3% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, and approximately 26.0% of our GMV for such period was generated from sales in North America which were mainly attributable to Lumens, our digital e-commerce platform of lighting, accessories and furniture in the United States, which we acquired in 2021. We expect the APAC region and North America to continue to drive growth, with consistent demand also expected in our home geographies and Western Europe. We also benefit from a diversified distribution network comprised of four distribution channels (contract, ecommerce, DOS and wholesale), enabling us to reach a broad range of customers. We expect our omni-channel distribution network will continue to represent a key contributor to our growth, driven in particular by our ecommerce business, which grew from €3.9 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 (or 0.7% of our revenue from contracts with customers in such year) to €103.7 million of revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 (or 12.2% of our revenue from contracts with customers for such period), mainly as a result of the acquisition of our U.S. based e-commerce platform Lumens in 2021. For further details on our distribution channels, see “—Sophisticated omni-channel distribution network focused on DTC and branded channels, _optimizing customer reach and maximizing brand strength”._ In addition to a diversified mix of product categories, geographies and distribution channels, we benefit from low customer concentration risk. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our top 20 customers generated 18.9% of our revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.5,"Sophisticated omni-channel distribution network focused on DTC and branded channels, optimizing customer reach and maximizing brand strength","Our distribution network is comprised of three direct-to-customer (“DTC”) channels (contract, DOS and ecommerce) and the wholesale channel. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the wholesale channel generated approximately 47.2%, the contract channel approximately 24.5%, the DOS network approximately 5.7% and ecommerce sales approximately 22.6% of our GMV, respectively. Our omni-channel approach allows us to reach a wide range of diversified customers both directly via our contract, DOS and e-commerce channels, and indirectly via our wholesale channel through a variety of intermediate players, including dealers, resellers, retailers and an extensive network of approximately 350,000 loyal specifiers, including architects and designers serving the local markets where we are present, which in our experience have a high degree of influence over the end customers purchase decisions. We believe our omni-channel distribution network optimizes customer reach and maximizes the strength of our brands. _Contract_ Our contract channel delivers bespoke design services to customers that are not typically accessible through traditional retail outlets, including residential and commercial customers, utilizing both products from our catalogues and custom made products, as well as certain complementary products from third party producers. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our contract channel has approximately 12,000 projects in pipeline. Among some of the notable recent projects completed by the Contract division are the One Thousand Museum Residences by Zaha Hadid Architects in Miami, The Polaris Lounge by Studio SCB Chicago and the Bulgari Hotel in Tokyo and Rome by Antonio Citterio and Patricia Viel. We believe the wide variety of commercial ----- customers and the larger scale of contract projects make our contract channel a strong vehicle for cross-selling opportunities, increasing the visibility of the products from all our brands and our market penetration. Although a large proportion of contract work is currently driven by B&B, the combination of our brands has provided us with the opportunity to broaden the scope of our contract work, offering a floor-to-ceiling contract service encompassing furnishings from B&B, kitchens from Arclinea and lighting products from Flos and Louis Poulsen. _DOS_ Our DOS channel is a powerful marketing tool that drives brand awareness, allows full control over our brands and often provides enhanced visibility to our end customers. It comprises retail stores that sell only products from our brands, either individually by brand or in a combination with products from our other brands, thereby increasing cross selling opportunities by giving our customers the opportunity to purchase such products. As an example, our new DOS in Boston, Massachusetts, sells products from our B&B Italia, Maxalto and Arclinea brands. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our DOS channel includes 19 stores managed directly by our Group companies, all located in key luxury markets around the world in cities such as Milan, London, New York, Paris and Hong Kong. DOS and directly-operated showrooms are a highly valuable distribution channel as they not only drive sales, but also increase brand strength, serving as a hub for marketing events and design fairs. _E-Commerce_ Our e-commerce channel consists of our e-commerce websites selling in 36 geographies across the world and managed directly by our various companies, along with our U.S. online platform Lumens, which sells both products from our brands as well as third-party products. _Wholesale_ Our wholesale channel includes 5,521 brick-and-mortar points of sale throughout the world, managed by third parties, in various different formats, with a special focus on (i) mono-brand stores (137), accounting for 6.9% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022; (ii) shop-in-shops (875), accounting for 9.0% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022; and (iii) multi-brand stores (4,490), accounting for 21.2% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022. We classify the mono-brand and shop-in-shop stores as the branded segment of our wholesale channel as our brands in those stores are clearly identifiable by the end-customers. The wholesale channel also includes e-tailers (e-commerce websites), omnichannel partners and pure players in e-commerce (approximately 1,122), accounting for 10.1% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022. The wholesale channel enables us to increase customer reach while limiting distribution costs.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.6,Flexible and robust industrial platform with control over entire value chain,"As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have ten in-house production facilities, differentiated by brand and product type, each of which focuses on the most critical and delicate processing phases to ensure the highest quality of our products. Specifically, we operate seven production facilities in Italy (two of which are located in Misinto (Milan), dedicated to B&B Italia and Fendi Casa, respectively), one in Valencia (Spain), one in Vejen (Denmark) and one in New York. Each facility is dedicated to a single brand’s production. As of June 30, 2023, our production facilities were supported by a network of approximately 1,950 carefully selected and diversified external suppliers located throughout the world and typically in close proximity to our inhouse production facilities, many of whom have been longstanding partners of ours. The following chart shows the composition of our suppliers by geographical area as of December 31, 2022: ----- For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, approximately 44% of our production was carried out in house at our production facilities (typically relating to the most critical components of our products), while the remainder of our production (fabrication or assembly) was carried out through suppliers and partners outside the Group. This approach enables us to combine high levels of flexibility and scalability of production levels with the maintenance of high-quality standards and, coupled with our make-to-order driven footprint (with approximately 69% of our total production relating to make-to-order purchases for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023), allows us to have strong control over the entire value chain, from initial design of the product to supply and in-house production or outsourced production, as applicable, assembly of the finished product and transportation and logistics.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.7,"Predictable revenues coupled with asset light, variable cost base and limited working capital requirements and strong cash flow generation","Our production is mainly focused on sales of made-to-order products, in particular that associated with our furniture, which represented approximately 69% of our total production for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, with the remainder being made-to-stock products. Our made-to-order sales typically have upfront payment terms, with approximately 30% to 50% of the final product price being paid by customers at the time of the order confirmation and the remaining approximately 70% to 50%, as applicable, being paid upon delivery. The significant contribution of our made-to-order sales to our total sales gives us visibility of our expected revenue streams in the short term (approximately eight weeks for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, providing revenue visibility of approximately two months for our made-to-order products). Where we do not operate on a made-to-order basis, we benefit from limited inventory risk given the long lifespan of our products. Our business, which is asset light by nature, also has a predominantly variable cost base. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that approximately 68% of our operating expenses was represented by variable costs. Our cash flow generation is in turn supported by low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Our net operating working capital was €69.9 million as of June 30, 2023 (representing 8.2% of our total revenues for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023), €46.9 million as of December 31, 2022 (representing 5.5% of our total revenues for such year), €3.3 million as of December 31, 2021 (representing 0.5% of our total revenues for such year) (exceptionally low mainly due to the acquisition of Lumens in 2021), and €33.9 million as of December 31, 2020 (representing 6.4% of our total revenues for such year), resulting in limited working capital requirements. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, capital expenditures represented only 4.7%, 4.6%, 5.1% and 4.3% of our total revenues for such periods, of which the majority represented discretionary growth capital expenditures. We have historically enjoyed strong cash flow generation through the economic cycle, including during the 20082010 global financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, supported by our high profitability levels and limited capital expenditure requirements. We have also historically recorded stable Adjusted EBITDA Margin and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we delivered consistently high Adjusted EBITDA Margins above 25% for each relevant period, despite the Emerging Brands having delivered lower margins than our Core Brands for these periods, mainly in light of the initial phase of their development. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, our Pro Forma Revenue was €426.5 million, €700.3 million and €867.6 million, respectively (in each case giving pro forma effect to the acquisition of Lumens, as regards 2021, and Audo, as regards 2022, as if we had acquired them on January 1 of the relevant year). The revenue of Flos for the year ended December 31, 2014, the year of its acquisition, was €159.2 million. For the same periods, our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was €102.2 million, €194.6 million and €219.3 million, respectively, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 24.0%, 27.2% and 25.3%, respectively. Our Free Cash Flow (calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period minus Maintenance Capital Expenditure for such period) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was €208.0 million, €206.6 million, €175.0 million and €133.2 million, resulting in Free Cash Flow Conversion (calculated as the ratio of Free Cash Flow for the relevant period to Adjusted EBITDA for such period) for each such period of 95.2%, 94.7%, 91.8% and 93.0%, respectively. We believe that our brand strength gives us strong pricing power, typically allowing us to pass the effects of increased raw material and component costs or adverse exchange rate fluctuations to our customers. Since our incorporation upon the joint acquisition by entities affiliated with Carlyle and Investindustrial of Flos, B&B Italia and Louis Poulsen in 2018, we have been able to reduce our net leverage from approximately 5.4x at the time of the acquisition (calculated at that time as the ratio of net financial indebtedness to (pre-IFRS 16) “Target Group Synergized EBITDA”) to 4.4x as of June 30, 2023 (calculated as the ratio of net financial indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this Offering Memorandum). -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

We aim to continue to attract up-and-coming international design talents and seek new collaborations with renowned stylists, fashion maisons and other players in the highend luxury industry to both develop new attractive and innovative products and reinforce the strength of our existing heritage designs, through for example the launch of new limited editions of our timeless iconic products. Our collaboration with English stylist Stella McCartney in 2023 for the development of B&B Italia’s Le Bambole x Stella McCartney is an example of how the close cooperation with top international brands in the high-end Luxury industry can reinforce the strength of our existing heritage designs. In addition, Louis Poulsen’s collaboration with talented emerging architect and designer Anne Boysen led to the production of the Moonsetter lamp, which was the winning design in the Next Danish Design Classic competition broadcast on national Danish television in 2020 and received the Lamp of the Year Award at the Design Awards in 2021. Another example of recent successful cooperation with a talented emerging designer is the Kompa Collection, designed by Botswanan Peter Mabeo for Fendi Casa, merging traditional African artisanship with luxury design. Going forward, we believe the enhancement of the desirability of our brands will also be increasingly dependent on our ability to deliver innovative products with a sustainability focus, including through eco-design, which considers environmental aspects at all stages of the product development process, in an effort to develop design solutions which make the lowest possible environmental impact throughout the product life cycle. For example, in 2023, we launched several eco-design projects, including Céramique, Emi, Bilboquet, Black Flag and Workmates for Flos, Eryt, Tortello Heri ‘O, Nooch and Cordoba Outdoor for B&B Italia, and Arclinea’s “g_cover” innovative new finishing, which is made with the recycled by-product from the manufacturing process of man-made graphite, enhancing the durability of Arclinea’s kitchens. We also intend to continue to support our younger brands through the various development phases and, in particular, we seek to accelerate the growth trajectory of our brands which are currently in their start-up phase, such Audo and Azucena, and development phase, such as Fendi Casa, Maxalto, Lumens and Arclinea, and to continue to develop new products. In order to continue to strengthen the desirability of our brands, we expect to continue to coordinate our marketing and advertising efforts through a single and pre-defined strategy for the Group, focusing on the creation of compelling contents, the prioritization of digital and social media for our advertisement campaigns and a deeper comprehension of our customers’ preferences and behaviors through dedicated customer relationship management (“CRM”) tools. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In particular, we aim to concentrate our focus on North America and Greater China, where we believe there is the greatest growth potential. As part of our strategy to expand in the United States, in 2021, we acquired Lumens, our U.S. based online platform which sells both products from our brands as well as third-party products. This acquisition materially boosted both e-commerce sales and sales in the Americas, which grew from €3.9 million and €74.9 million in 2020, respectively, to €103.7 million and €225.3 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. We believe the U.S. market is still underpenetrated and plan to continue to leverage on Lumens and our network of architects and designers to increase our sales in the region. Key growth initiatives in the United States will include: (i) expanding our architects and designers network through CRM and other digital tools and marketing events across brands; (ii) increasing the number of points of sales with a focus on space branding (mono-brand and shop-in-shop); (iii) selectively opening new stores in key locations with high growth potential, including New York, Miami and Boston; (iv) accelerating our contract channel expansion in the hospitality and retail space; and (v) optimizing the regional supply chain in our lighting business (both production and logistics). Moreover, the expansion in the Greater China region is one of our strategic priorities and, to that end, we have appointed a CEO Greater China at the Design Holding Level who oversees the commercial efforts in the region, including the opening of local stores, the roll-out of mono-brand stores with local partners and a digital-led marketing strategy to generate brand awareness and support distribution of products in the area. In 2022, we incorporated a new subsidiary in Shanghai, Design Holding (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., to facilitate our expansion in the region. We have the opportunity to establish our brands as pioneers in the region, especially in light of the still underdeveloped knowledge of the luxury design market among customers. Key growth initiatives in Greater China will include: (i) the creation of a Greater China Business Unit with its own sales and marketing teams and a dedicated e-commerce website; (ii) increasing wholesale distribution in key urban areas through mono-brand stores and shop-in-shops; (iii) selectively opening new stores (including via the B&B Italia Design Studio format) in key locations with high growth potential, such as Shanghai; and (iv) accelerating marketing activities and digital penetration through dedicated platforms.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategies,9.4.3,"Shift focus towards DTC and “branded” channels, develop our store network and foster growth of our online segment","One of our key strategic goals is to grow our DTC distribution channels, which typically allow us to exercise greater control over pricing of our products and be closer to our end customers, in particular by supporting the migration of end customers in our wholesale channel (e.g., consumers walking into third-party managed multibrand or mono-brand stores or shop-in-shops or customers purchasing our products from online resellers) to either our DOS or in-house e-commerce platforms. Growth initiatives for our DOS channel will include (i) the selected roll out of B&B Italia, Fendi Casa and Flos / Louis Poulsen DOS in key cities with high growth potential; (ii) the enhancement of retail customer experience across our network through sales personnel excellence; and (iii) increased focus on our architects and designers network to drive qualified traffic into our DOS. Growth initiatives for our e-commerce channel will include (i) the launch of new limited editions, collaborations and other exclusive products or e-marketing campaigns; (ii) the enhancement of digital services available to architects and industry professionals, which raise our profile and support our success across the value chain from the creation of the designs, to the development of the products and the final distribution to customers; and (iii) offer premium services to our e-customers in connection with product delivery and installation. In our wholesale channel, our main efforts will focus on the “brandization” of wholesale spaces through the increase in the number of mono-brand stores and shop-in-shops and, wherever possible, the increase of in-store space, as well as the selective expansion in luxury department stores.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategies,9.4.4,Enhance leadership position in high-end contract business,"We intend to selectively accelerate the growth of our contract business in attractive sectors with high growth potential, such as the high-end residential, hospitality and office sectors, and expand our contract channel in selected underpenetrated geographies, such as North America and Greater China. Our contract channel played a key role in the recent projects relating to the Bulgari Hotel in Rome and Tokyo and the One Thousand Museum Residences by Zaha Hadid Architects in Miami, as regards our Arclinea and B&B Italia brands, as well as the Bourse du Commerce in Paris, as regards our Flos brand. ----- Key growth initiatives include: (i) improvement of the contract business capillarity by expanding the pipeline in specific regions (United States, China and the Middle East) and segments (residential, hospitality, retail and office for lighting); and (ii) increase synergies with other brands of the Group, increasing average project value and accelerating business generation by adding sister brands to projects and boosting cross-brand penetration on identified top accounts. We also plan to increase “soft” contract retail business opportunities within our DOS network by targeting retail customers and their specifiers in connection with smaller projects than the projects traditionally developed by our contract business. Soft contract projects may entail, for example, the supply of integrated furniture and lighting products to private individuals in connection with the construction or refurbishment of their homes or vacation houses. We believe the required cooperation with our customers in the development of these projects helps us build closer relationships with them.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategies,9.4.5,Significant opportunity from new procurement cost saving initiatives under implementation,"One of our key operational priorities, along with maintaining and improving our high quality standards, is to continue the deployment of cost synergies from the creation of Design Holding and the further consolidation of our Group and coordination among our brands. In particular, we have identified a number of procurement optimization opportunities across both direct and indirect procurement categories, which we currently expect will deliver run-rate annual cost savings for an aggregate estimated amount of €17.8 million in the next three to four years, with approximately 43% of these savings estimated to be achieved by 2024 (€1.4 million in 2023 and €6.2 million in 2024) and the remainder in 2025 (€6.6 million) and 2026 (€3.6 million). We expect to incur one-off costs in order to achieve these cost savings of approximately €3 million between 2023 and the first half of 2024 related to the fees charged by the external consultant we have engaged in connection with the implementation of these procurement optimization initiatives. In the case of direct procurement, the identified initiatives relate to the procurement of semi-finished and finished products and raw materials. With respect to semi-finished and finished products, initiatives include the application of best-practice contracting methods and negotiations with suppliers, leveraging price transparency, should-cost analyses and win-win strategies, as well as improved visibility over prices applied by competing suppliers. With respect to raw materials, we intend to increase the competition among our suppliers (including by approaching competing suppliers and reviewing the existing supplier base) to obtain immediate or retroactive price decreases. We currently estimate that our cost savings and efficiency initiatives in the direct procurement category have the potential of delivering €9.4 million of run-rate annual cost savings in the next three to four years. In the case of indirect procurement, the identified initiatives relate to: (i) logistics and facility management, where we intend to call for tenders of regional logistics services with volume bundles over common routes, as well as renegotiate existing contractual arrangements; (ii) marketing and sales, where we intend to consolidate our expenditures by bundling our products into a single unit, apply demand management and leverage marketing benchmarks; (iii) professional services, where we intend to bundle demand, select preferred suppliers, review and renegotiate contracts and disable unused licenses; (iv) information technology and communication, where we intend to reduce costs by bundling hardware and software volumes, using benchmarks to increase supplier competition and renegotiating contracts; (v) packaging, where we intend to reduce costs by calling for tenders, leveraging value engineering and harmonizing specifications; and (vi) other indirect categories (e.g. R&D activities, mobility and travel, maintenance, repair and operations, etc.), where we intend to achieve cost savings by performing structured procurement activities, such as harmonization, bundling, benchmarking, standardization and negotiation. In addition, we launched the optimization of our insurance coverage by way of coordinated policy management and alignment of risk management across our brands. We currently estimate that our cost savings and efficiency initiatives in the indirect procurement category have the potential of delivering €8.4 million of run-rate annual cost savings in the next three to four years.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

We are open to considering and we constantly scrutinize additional strategic acquisitions, some of which could be significant in size, to add to our portfolio, capitalize on our competitive strengths, expand our geographic footprint and reach in jurisdictions, including outside of Europe, where we see potential growth opportunities and/or where we currently have limited operations, further diversify our product offering, preserve or improve our financial performance and/or benefit from further consolidation expected in the design industry. Any further potential acquisition opportunities will be evaluated in light of a prudent and rigorous ----- analysis to preserve a solid financial position and high profitability. We will continue to apply a disciplined approach to pricing in connection with these potential acquisitions and will place significant emphasis on carefully planning and executing our acquisition strategy.

Furthermore, the preliminary unaudited financial information below does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the period to which it refers. The preliminary unaudited information set forth below regarding our results for the periods indicated is based on management accounts and systems and in part on estimates. We believe the estimates underlying the financial information presented below may provide investors with a helpful indication of the development of our results of operations following June 30, 2023. However, our actual results for the third quarter of 2023 may differ materially from the trends and ranges included herein. The preliminary information set forth below should not be regarded as an indication, forecast, capsule financial information or representation regarding our financial results for the three months ending September 30, 2023 or for any other period. Moreover, the comparative information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, have been calculated on a pro forma basis to give effect to the acquisition of Audo, as if it had occurred on October 1, 2021. Such pro forma information has been prepared by management for illustrative purposes only. The pro forma information included herein has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards, and does not purport to project the future financial results of operations of the combined entities. Neither our independent auditors nor any other independent auditors have audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to such pro forma information for the purpose of its inclusion herein or for any other purposes and, accordingly, neither our independent auditors nor any other independent auditors have expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum. You should therefore not place undue reliance on the preliminary information presented below. In addition, the revenue recognition and measurement criteria we utilize in our management accounts may be different from those we utilize in our statutory accounts. Therefore, sales and operating results from our management accounts are marginally different from revenues and operating results deriving from our statutory accounts and consolidated financial statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Presentation of financial and other information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” and “Presentation of financial and other information—Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information in Respect of the Emerging Brands”._ As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not finalized trading results for the three months ending September 30, 2023. However, based on preliminary results derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information currently available to us, we estimate our sales from customers for the twelve months ending September 30, 2023 to be between €805 million and €815 million, compared to €841.3 million pro forma sales from customers for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 (after giving pro forma effect to the acquisition of Audo, as if it had occurred on October 1, 2021). Notwithstanding the decrease in sales from customers, we estimate our EBITDA margin adjusted for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 to be above 25%. The expected decrease in sales from customers was primarily driven by reduced volumes in our wholesale distribution channel, mainly due to uncertainty on the economic outlook as a result of the current adverse global macroeconomic environment, while we expect our DTC channels achieved single digit growth in sales from customers. In particular, in respect of our contract distribution channel we estimate our sales from customers for the twelve months ending September 30, 2023 increased by approximately 9% from €231.2 million pro forma sales from customers for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Our strong focus on and timely implementation of cost containment measures enabled us to mitigate the estimated decrease in sales from customers for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and achieve an estimated higher EBITDA margin adjusted as compared to the corresponding period of 2022. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have identified a number of additional procurement optimization opportunities across both direct and indirect procurement categories, which we expect will deliver run-rate annual cost savings for an aggregate estimated amount of €17.8 million in the next three to four years, as further described under “—Our Strategies—Significant _opportunity from new procurement cost saving initiatives under implementation”.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the Collateral, holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain super priority hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. The security interests in the Collateral may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain_ defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes— _Security” and “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral”._ (5) The Issuer has made, inter alia, certain intercompany loans (the “Intercompany Loans”) to certain of its existing subsidiaries (Flos, B&B, Danish HoldCo and Lumens) in order to, inter alia, allow those companies to refinance certain of their respective outstanding indebtedness. The Intercompany Loans were originally funded by the Issuer with, among other things, a portion of the proceeds from the Existing Notes and certain other previously existing indebtedness of the Issuer, as applicable. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Flos I/C Loan amounts to €119.2 million, the B&B I/C Loan amounts to €87.5 million, the Danish HoldCo I/C Loan amounts to €101.5 million and the Lumens I/C Loan amounts to approximately $66.8 million. For further information on the Intercompany Loans, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercompany Loans”. The receivables of the Issuer under the Intercompany Loans will form part of the Collateral securing the Notes, and currently already secure on a _pari passu basis the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. ----- (6) Approximately 1.6% of Lumens’ issued and outstanding equity interests is currently owned by members of Lumens’ management team. Such minority equity interests are not part of the Collateral. (7) Following the Revolving Credit Facility Upsize, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions specified therein, €140 million Revolving Credit Facility will be available under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. We expect the Revolving Credit Facility Upsize will become effective on or around the Issue Date, subject to, among others, the Issue Date occurring. See “Summary—The Transactions— _The Revolving Credit Facility Upsize”. We expect that €18.6 million of drawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will remain_ outstanding following the Refinancing. In addition, in the event that freely available cash on our balance sheet on or about the Issue Date is lower than our estimate, we may draw down additional amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date or shortly thereafter. The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the same entities that guarantee the Existing Notes and will guarantee the Notes, and will be secured on a first-priority basis over the same Collateral that secures the Existing Notes and will secure the Notes, subject to the applicable contractual and legal limitations. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain material limitations under applicable law as described under “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and _the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”._ (8) On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Within 20 Business Days from the Issue Date, subject to certain agreed security principles and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each of B&B, Flos, Louis Poulsen, Antares and Lumens (collectively, the “Guarantors”). As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented 61.1% of the consolidated revenue of the Issuer, 77.6% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer and 80.2% of the consolidated total assets of the Issuer (as to assets, including the value of goodwill and trademark allocated to B&B, Flos and Louis Poulsen in the Consolidated Financial Statements), in each case, including the contribution of Ares S.r.l. (which generated approximately 1.2% of the consolidated revenue of the Issuer and approximately 2.6% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer and accounted for approximately 2.3% of the consolidated total assets of the Issuer) and Flos Bespoke S.r.l. (which generated approximately 0.8% of the consolidated revenue of the Issuer and approximately 1.0% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer and accounted for approximately 0.4% of the consolidated total assets of the Issuer), which we plan to merge into Flos by the first half of 2024. As of June 30, 2023, the Guarantors (including Ares S.r.l. and Flos Bespoke S.r.l., which we plan to merge into Flos by the first half of 2024) had €32.3 million in aggregate principal amount of external third-party indebtedness, none of which was secured and €21.6 million of which was represented by lease obligations under IFRS 16, and all of which is expected to remain in place following the Transactions. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain material contractual and legal limitations. See “Certain _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related _to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”_ and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, _capital maintenance and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral”. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor_ Agreement and may be subject to release under certain circumstances. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Notes—The Notes Guarantees”._ (9) Certain subsidiaries of the Issuer will not guarantee the Notes. As of June 30, 2023, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not expected to guarantee the Notes (excluding Ares S.r.l. and Flos Bespoke S.r.l., which we plan to merge into Flos by the first half of 2024) had €68.4 million in aggregate principal amount of external third-party indebtedness, none of which was secured and €64.8 million of which was represented by lease obligations under IFRS 16, and all of which is expected to remain in place following the Transactions. As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the subsidiaries of the Issuer which are not expected to guarantee the Notes represented 38.9% of the consolidated revenue of the Issuer, 22.4% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer and 19.8% of the consolidated total assets of the Issuer. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

(1) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) for the period excluding the effect of income taxes, net financial expenses (income), amortization and depreciation and net profit of discontinued operations (if any), on the basis of our consolidated profit and loss statement presented in accordance with IFRS, as derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements, as adjusted for certain non-core and non-recurring items occurred in the relevant period. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of the performance of the Issuer that is not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. This measure is not a measurement of the financial performance of the Issuer under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows or any other measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information with respect to the overall operating performance and debt service capacity of the Issuer by facilitating comparisons of operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of items not directly resulting from the Group’s core operations. We believe Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to assist in their assessment of the trading performance of the business of the Issuer. We note, however, that Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered a substitute measure to net income, net income margin, as an indicator of operating performance, as an alternative to operating cash flows or as a measure of our liquidity.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,"We are affected by general economic conditions worldwide, and unfavorable economic conditions could result in a decline in the demand for our products and a material adverse effect on our financial performance.","Our revenue, profitability, cash flow and future growth are affected by general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns. The foregoing may also be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends, whether actual or perceived, or adverse developments such as wars and geopolitical tensions, pandemics or other health related crisis, increasing energy or other commodity prices and surging benchmark interest rates, as well as a highly inflationary environment, any of which may reduce consumers’ ability or willingness to spend. In particular, our business is heavily dependent on the demand for high-end furniture and lighting products, especially in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, which make up a significant portion of our revenue. Declining economic conditions in any of the locations in which we operate, economic stagnation as a result of geopolitical tensions and their associated effects or negative perceptions about economic conditions, could lead to a decrease in consumer spending and ultimately a decline in the demand for our products, which in turn would adversely affect our business. In particular, our products are discretionary items and sales of such items normally depend on positive consumer sentiment and the availability of discretionary income. For example, according to certain industry sources, the effects of the COVID19 pandemic resulted in the high-end furniture and lighting design market decreasing in size from approximately €38 billion in 2019 to approximately €35 billion in 2020. The current unstable geopolitical, macroeconomic and financial environment, including as a result of the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and global inflationary surge, at both the EMEA level, where our revenue is concentrated, as well as at the global level, could affect our production capacity, results of operations and growth prospects. From 2013 until the COVID-19 pandemic started, the global economy was growing at a modest pace, curbed by the stagnation of economic activity in parts of Europe, as well as the slow-down of several emerging economies. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 significantly increased global uncertainty from an economic and social perspective, which resulted in materially increased volatility and declines in financial markets, supply chain disruptions and weaker demand in the global economy. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected and may continue to pose risks to our business, financial _condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”. More recently, global economic conditions have been, and are likely to continue to be, affected_ by concerns over increased geopolitical tensions as well as political developments affecting several countries, the possible exit from the European Union of more Member States and/or the replacement of the euro by one or more successor currencies. See “—Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential _reintroduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could negatively impact our business or our ability to refinance our liabilities. In addition, economic conditions and political uncertainty in Italy and Europe could affect our business”. These events could have a detrimental impact_ on the global economic recovery and the repayment of sovereign and non-sovereign debt in certain countries, as well as on the financial condition of European institutions, further increasing the volatility in the European financial markets, which may affect demand for our products. 31 ----- In particular, tensions resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in late February 2022 and the associated effects on the global economy including, among others, increasing energy prices and surging benchmark interest rates, the current tensions between China and the United States, continued hostilities in the Middle East and tensions in North Africa and Eastern Europe have adversely affected and could continue to negatively affect international economic conditions. The possibility that geopolitical tensions among the major world economies continue for an indefinite period of time or deteriorate further cannot be excluded. As of the time of this Offering Memorandum, the climate of economic uncertainty generated by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ensuing conflict is ongoing. Additional geopolitical tensions arose on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. Shortly following the attack, Israel’s security cabinet declared war against Hamas. The intensity and duration of Israel’s current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, and as are such war’s economic implications on our business and operations. Material increases in global inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not seen since the 1980s, and expectations that annual inflation may remain high for a long period of time (driven at least in part by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting impact on food and energy markets) have also forced central banks of the major world economies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, to accelerate the withdrawal of emergency monetary policies and liquidity support measures put in place prior to and during the earlier stages of the COVID19 pandemic and to significantly increase market interest rates in a very short timeframe. As some of these measures expire, are withdrawn or are no longer supported by governments, and as global inflation levels and interest rates continue to remain high, economic growth may be negatively impacted, which in turn may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance. These factors have also impacted the availability and price of energy and, in general, of raw materials, increased inflationary pressure on the global economy as well as led to bank failures, events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance and other adverse corporate developments. Further increases in global inflation levels would result in increased production costs through higher raw material costs (which might be further exacerbated by the potential rise of oil and gas prices following the recent outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas) and related transport costs, in addition to higher labor costs. Production costs may vary significantly depending on several other factors, including the economic cyclicality of the target markets, supply scarcity, government measures and regulatory restrictions, such as those that may be imposed in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases or other infectious disease outbreaks, new or increased tariffs or customs duties and higher energy costs. Each of these events are, largely, beyond our control and difficult to predict. Increased production costs may require us to pass through volatility to the end consumer by way of increased prices, which may have negative effects on our sales volume. Deteriorating economic conditions limiting demand for our products may also increase pricing pressure on the products that we sell and result in a corresponding decline in our margins. Historically, we have not used derivatives to hedge the price fluctuation risk of raw materials, relying instead on our ability to pass on volatility to our customers through price increases. However, there is no guarantee that we may be able to pass on such cost increases to our customers promptly, if at all, which may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See “—If prices of _the raw materials we employ in our manufacturing processes or of the components or finished products we purchase were to increase, our business could be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to pass any such price increases on to our customers”._ Although the U.S. economy currently appears to be withstanding the global economic headwinds, supported, in part, by resilient consumer spending and various economic measures passed under the Biden administration, including the Inflation Reduction Act of August 16, 2022, there can be no assurance that it will avoid a downturn, or that it will not, in the near future, and particularly in view of the 2024 presidential elections, engage in protectionism or trade wars with other countries that could adversely impact global economic conditions. Furthermore, the weakening of currencies in some emerging countries from time to time increases the risk of financial contagion in emerging markets globally. Any extended recession or other periods of declining economic conditions, either globally or in any of the locations in which we operate, could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainty remains in the global markets and the global economy could experience another recession, or a depression, which could be more prolonged or have greater financial impact than past global recessions. Continued weakness in the global economy for a significant period of time, or a further deterioration of global economic conditions, may lead to a collapse in consumer and business confidence that could adversely affect consumer-spending behavior, which is driven by levels of unemployment, inflation or deflation, disposable income, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit and consumer perception of their own economic prospects and overall economic conditions. Global economic conditions and uncertainties may also affect our suppliers, resulting in, for example, supplier plant closures or increases in the cost of merchandise and/or raw 32 ----- materials. As a result, an economic downturn or persistent unfavorable economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, particularly conditions that negatively affect consumer spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although to different degrees, these factors affect all markets in which we operate. Our revenue, profitability, expansion of our customer base, which is characterized by high spending power, and growth prospects could therefore be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions, economic downturns or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook, globally or in one or more of the principal markets in which we operate or will operate in the future. For example, as a result of low consumer confidence from uncertainty over the economic outlook in the Nordic countries, especially in Denmark, Sweden and Norway, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, Louis Poulsen generated €55.6 million of revenue from contracts with customers compared to €77.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of 28.4%. The contraction is also related to high interest rates and cost of mortgages discouraging residential real estate transactions, which, in turn, reduced demand for Louis Poulsen products as well as customer footfall in the brand’s stores. See “—Consumer spending on high-end design products could be displaced by _spending on other activities as driven by a number of factors”._ Global economic conditions may also be impacted by continued adverse developments in the banking and financial services industry. In March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were closed by regulators in the United States following liquidity concerns. In Europe, Credit Suisse came close to a collapse in March 2023, which led to UBS agreeing to acquire its business, following the intervention of Swiss regulatory authorities. The pressure on U.S. regional banks has continued, leading to the announcement by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on May 1, 2023, that First Republic Bank, a California based regional bank, would be taken over by JPMorgan Chase. In addition, China’s property market currently faces stressing events (including, for example, the Evergrande group commencing Chapter 15 proceedings in the United States in August 2023) which may lead to a widespread crisis of the entire real estate and financial sectors, with systemic implications which are currently difficult to predict. While we have no material exposure to these institutions, there is no guarantee that other financial institutions will not experience similar liquidity issues in the near future, or that actions taken by government authorities to mitigate these risks will be sufficient to ensure access to our cash deposits held at financial institutions and sources of liquidity. In addition, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional bank failures or issues in the broader financial system, which may have an impact on the broader capital markets and, in turn, our ability to access those markets, as well as general consumer confidence and their willingness for discretionary spending. Adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets could prevent us from obtaining financing or credit on favorable terms in order to fulfill our financing needs (including the need to refinance or repay our debt obligations, including the Notes). If we are unable to repay our debt obligations or access the credit and capital markets, we may not be able to pursue certain of our business plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, as a consequence of the EURIBOR interest rate increase, our interest payment on the Existing Floating Rate Notes increased to approximately €15.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 from €9.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. A substantial increase in consumer interest rates or tightening of lending standards could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Global economic conditions and uncertainties may also affect our suppliers, resulting in, for example, supplier plant closures or increases in the cost of merchandise and/or raw materials. As a result, an economic downturn or persistent unfavorable economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, particularly conditions that negatively affect consumer spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,Consumer spending on high-end design products could be displaced by spending on other activities as driven by a number of factors.,"Consumer spending on high-end design products could decrease or be displaced by spending on other activities as driven by a number of factors including: - general economic conditions and other factors that affect consumer discretionary spending; - reduced purchasing power as a result of the economic effects caused by inflation and higher costs of living; - housing market conditions, as consumers are generally more likely to purchase new lighting and furniture when they purchase a home; 33 ----- - shifts in behavior away from home decorating in favor of other products or activities, such as travel, entertainment or electronics; - natural and other disasters, including pandemics, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, heavy snow, ice or rain storms, which disrupt the ability of consumers to continue spending on high-end design products; - man-made disasters, such as terrorism or war, as well as other national and international security concerns; and - other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Total consumer spending may not rebound from the slowdown caused by the ongoing high inflation and recessionary risks. Even if it rebounds, it may not regain its historical rates in the short to medium term due to relative disposable income decreases and the spending habits of potential customers changing to reflect any increased uncertainty or apprehension regarding economic conditions, and it may not increase in certain product markets given changes in consumer interests. Moreover, as we expand into new geographic markets and product categories, we may not accurately predict consumer preferences in that market or product category, which could result in lower-than-expected sales. A decline in consumer spending on high-end design products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,"We may not be able to fully realize our commercial, strategic vision or expected synergies from acquired companies, including the Emerging Brands.","We may experience difficulties in maximizing collaboration across our portfolio brands and achieving our strategic vision, including taking advantage of cross-selling opportunities. We were formed as a result of the combination of three large and complex businesses that had historically been operated separately and have since then acquired Lumens and Audo and entered into the Fendi Casa joint venture. Although we have been successful to date, we cannot assure you that our management team will continue to effectively direct the combined businesses or fully achieve the synergies from both the full integration of Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen, as well as the Emerging Brands, including through the coordination of certain activities by our centralized management team. Generally, the more brands and companies we acquire and consolidate in our Group, the more difficult it may become for us to ensure coordination among them. In addition, our ability to maintain our growth rates will depend, among other things, on our ability to structure our internal organization in order to respond promptly and effectively to the needs arising from our consolidation and growth process, the successful implementation of our strategy and the investments that we intend to make to expand our operations. Should we be unable to continue and efficiently manage the process of growth and adjustment of the organizational model, we may not realize our commercial and strategic vision. To the extent that we pursue further acquisitions or joint ventures in line with our growth strategy, any of these risks may be further exacerbated. We may also incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits and synergies. We believe that our combined portfolio can continue to generate synergies from, inter alia, the opening of new stores directly operated by us, including DOS, mono-brand stores and shop-in-shops while reducing the number of multi-brand stores; sharing information on contracts and pipelines of new contract projects among all of our businesses through a centralized CRM infrastructure; the centralization of certain administrative functions; optimizing warehousing and logistics functions in certain countries where we operate and renegotiating contracts with logistics service providers; and integrating and consolidating operations and management across the geographies in which we operate. There can be no assurance that we will be able to realize any of these synergies, and the costs we incur in trying to realize these synergies may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh the benefits. With the integration of our Emerging Brands into our existing operating structure, we have generated certain synergies, as for example we have benefited from increased sales of our products through Lumens’ e-commerce platform and we will also benefit from the sale of Lumens private label products, which Lumens is currently in the process of setting up. Our acquisitions of Lumens and Audo, as well as our Fendi Casa joint venture, have also enabled us to expand our international reach, given Lumens’ solid positioning within the market for online sales of lighting and furniture brands in the Unites States, Audo’s extended international distribution network, which also covers the United States, and Fendi Casa’s brand association with the high-value fashion brand of Maison Fendi. Although we have benefited from such initiatives, there is no guarantee that current and expected synergies, including following the acquisition of Lumens and Audo, and our Fendi Casa joint venture, will continue or be 34 ----- achieved in the expected timeframe or at all, or that the costs, both one-off and recurring, incurred to achieve such synergies will not be greater than the synergies themselves. In particular, we may be unable to successfully combine our operating structure and extensive distribution network with the online sales platform operated by Lumens efficiently or effectively and in that case we may not be able to recover the cost incurred to obtain the envisaged synergies, including the costs related to the improvement of the on-line sales platform of the Lumens and any potential loss of revenues from existing customers of Lumens who might prefer to sell their products through our competitors maintaining that the Lumens focuses more on promoting our products than theirs. In addition, following our acquisition of Audo, the company was impacted by a sharp increase of freight costs, as well as increases in inventory levels and net debt, which required us to implement a recovery plan to contain additional expenses and regulate margins. See also “—In case we carry out acquisitions as part of our growth _strategy, they may not deliver anticipated benefits”._ In addition, we may fail to achieve our organic growth objectives as a consequence of inflation and high interest rates, which may increase costs of expanding our store network and geographic reach. Capital expenditures that we estimate for use in such capacity expansion projects may be insufficient to cover the actual cost. In particular, as we focus on expanding our store network, we may incur substantial structural and operational costs to carry out this expansion through DOS, due to our direct control and management of these locations. The materialization of any of the foregoing risks could have a negative impact on our financial results.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Such trademark is considered an asset with indefinite useful life and, accordingly, is not amortized and is subject to periodical impairment tests. We cannot assure you that an adverse development in our business activities resulting in our financial performance and cash flow differing from the assumptions used for purposes of the impairment tests, or where there are significant macroeconomic uncertainties attributable, for example, to high interest rates or the prolongation or expansion of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia or any other geopolitical crisis, will not require us to reassess the useful life of our trademarks as finite rather than indefinite, or to recognize impairment charges to write-off all or a part of the carrying amount of our trademarks. No impairment or write-off of trademarks and other intangible assets resulted from the last impairment test performed on December 31, 2022 and no trigger events have been identified in the interim period ended June 30, 2023.

A write-off of all or a part of our trademarks would adversely affect our consolidated net income and capitalization. Furthermore, if we were to recognize substantial amounts of trademarks as a result of any future acquisitions, an adverse development in any of these future acquisitions could require us in the future to recognize impairment charges to write-off all or a part of the carrying amount of the trademarks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

As of June 30, 2023, our total goodwill, which represents the excess of the cost of acquisitions over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, amounted to €1,309.4 million, representing 50.0% of our total assets, which amounted to €2,619.5 million as of June 30, 2023. While goodwill is not subject to depreciation, we are required to conduct impairment tests on goodwill at least once a year and any such impairments could affect our results of operations and cash flow. The impairment test assesses the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill. Impairment tests rely on the latest available business plan of each CGU as well as external parameters, such as discount and growth rate assumptions as well as benchmarking analyses of other companies. General economic slowdowns, high inflation rates, high interest rates, exchange rate volatility, deterioration in one or more of the markets in which we operate, impairment in our financial performance and/or future outlook could affect the recoverable amount of our goodwill if, as a result of such impairment test, the fair value of the assets (CGU) is lower than their carrying value. In such case, an impairment charge would be recorded on our financial 35 ----- statements by means of a write off or write down of the amount of goodwill and a depreciation thereof and any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. No impairment of goodwill resulted from the last impairment test performed on December 31, 2022 and no trigger events have been identified in the interim period ended June 30, 2023.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.6,"If we are unable to successfully introduce new products, develop our brands and adapt to changing customer preferences, our business may suffer.","The high-end furniture and lighting industries are subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and trends. The purchasing decisions of consumers are highly subjective and can be influenced by many factors, such as marketing programs, product design and brand image. Consumers of our products tend to be design conscious, have rigorous standards and sophisticated tastes, which can be difficult to satisfy or anticipate. The historical success of our brands is attributable, in part, to our ability to introduce products which are perceived to anticipate, shape and reflect interior design trends. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred €6.6 million and €6.4 million, respectively, of capital expenditures on research and product development to support our ability to continue to produce innovative and beautifully designed products that meet our customers’ needs and expectations, which we believe is critical to our future success. As inflation and interest rates remain high, our ability to fund organic growth through capital expenditures may be negatively impacted. Our success also depends on our ability to react to changing customer and consumer demands, preferences and habits in a timely manner. We cannot predict whether the new products we launch will be well received by consumers in our target markets and/or demographics, or even whether such new products will be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner. Decisions regarding product design must be made months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured and, therefore, such decisions are inherently uncertain. An inability to keep pace with product development, anticipate consumer preferences, meet consumer demands or understand consumer habits could result in material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Decreased consumer demand may also result in decreased spending on promotional activities for our products, which may exacerbate the adverse impact on our volume of sales. Our business is also subject to changes in technology, such as the expanded use of LEDs in lighting, and if we fail to anticipate or adequately respond to such changes, or do not have sufficient capital to invest or respond to these developments, our profits may decline. Our future financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to adapt our products to evolving technology successfully, both to keep up with customer expectations and preferences and to improve our business operations. We cannot predict all the effects of future technological changes. The cost of adapting our products to new technologies could be significant, and our ability to finance these costs may be adversely affected by poor market conditions resulting in lower revenues and cash generation, our debt servicing requirements or our inability to obtain the financing we require. There can be no assurance that the investments we have made in product development and technology will generate expected returns by enabling us to increase or maintain market share. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our investment and business plans. Any inability to successfully adapt to changing customer preferences and technologies, make sufficient investments in research, technology renovation and product development or generate expected returns on those investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The key factors that affect competition in this market include the profiles of designers and the designs themselves, the technical know-how of internal research and product development teams, the breadth of distribution networks and the ability to interact with existing and new customers. Also important is a strong design heritage and the quality of relationships with designers and specifiers. Our competitors may focus more of their resources than we do on competitive activities, such as sales and marketing, research and product development and strategic acquisitions, or may have greater purchasing economies of scale and lower cost bases, including as a result of business combinations, such as the acquisition of Knoll by Herman Miller in 2021. To counter any of the aforementioned developments and preserve our position in the market, we may have to incur unplanned costs for the development of marketing activities, among other things, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 36 ----- Over the past several years, certain large international retailers such as IKEA and Maisons du Monde, historically focused on lower range furnishing and lighting products characterized by a low or absent design component, have expanded their product offerings to enter the “affordable inspirational” segment of the furniture and lighting market. This is an attempt to enlarge their customer base through the offering of quality products with appealing design and at lower price points compared to the high-end furnishing and lighting segment in which we operate. While we do not consider them our direct competitors, should these retailers continue to improve the design and quality of their products and maintain accessible price points, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers if we are not able to continue to materially differentiate our products and brands in terms of quality and design. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, although our custom and contract operations are currently less impacted by this competition, these retailers could expand their operations to such segments in the future. In particular, there are companies (such as Bemz, Semihandmade, Prettypegs) dedicated solely to taking minimal IKEA furniture and customizing it for the customer’s unique style and aesthetic. Moreover, our license agreements with designers typically do not grant us the rights to future designs of the licensors. When bidding for these licenses, or for licenses with new designers, our competitors may be able to offer more favorable payment terms or new license arrangements that strengthen their competitive position or prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities to work with certain designers, or we may be required, as a result of competitive pressure, to agree to less favorable terms than we have achieved historically in order to maintain our relationships or build new relationships with designers. Competitors may also be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or consumer preferences. Competitors may also possess broader distribution networks, have more extensive e-commerce operations, more actively sell through social media or have larger networks of directly operated stores, which could allow them to exercise more control over their brand than we can. In particular, barriers to entry for e-commerce or social networks are low, and current and new competitors can launch new e-commerce platforms or sell their products through social media at a relatively low cost while also reaching large numbers of potential customers by using the internet for marketing. Low barriers to entry also enable competitors to sell on e-commerce platforms counterfeit products that make unauthorized use of our brand names or other intellectual property assets. See “—If we are unable to protect our license and other _intellectual property rights from others, if counterfeiting increases or if our competitors or third parties assert intellectual property rights against us, our business may suffer, and we may incur significant additional costs”._ As a result of competition through e-commerce channels, we may experience pricing pressure and loss of market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Increased competition could limit our ability to increase our prices or require us to reduce prices or increase our spending on marketing, sales and research and product development, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In addition, any disruption in the operations of our distributors or in our relationships with them could adversely affect our business.","We generate a large portion of our revenue through wholesale retailers that we do not own and that we may approach either directly (including through our subsidiaries, where possible) or through third-party agents and distributors, depending on the features and practices of each relevant market. We normally have little control over the commercial practices of wholesale retailers, some of whom operate partially or exclusively as online retailers, or over third-party agents and distributors. In particular, while in certain regions we have implemented selective distribution policies that grant us a level of control over wholesalers’ pricing, it is otherwise difficult for us to monitor the price levels and commercial practices applied by wholesale retailers, third-party agents and distributors, especially through the internet, where our products could be subject to multiple interim sales before reaching the end customers. In most cases, wholesale retailers are not contractually bound to apply minimum price levels and could therefore apply discounts inconsistently in the same market or in different markets, which could be perceived negatively by our customers. In addition, if our wholesale retailers were to apply unfair commercial practices to the detriment of the end customers or offer material discounts on our products, our brand reputation could be harmed and sales in our retail channel could also suffer. Other than Lumens, each of our brands relies to a certain extent on third-party distributors and agents for the sale of their products, and our success depends in part on the quality of services provided by, and our relationships with, these third-party distributors and agents. We normally employ distributors and agents in countries or areas where we do not have a subsidiary or that we cannot otherwise reach directly with our sales team. Our relationships with these distributors and agents are a significant factor in our success and growth strategy. Even though we 37 ----- strive to monitor the operations and performance of our third-party distributors and agents and their compliance with applicable laws and with the contractual arrangements that govern our relationships with them, we do not own or control our third-party distributors and agents, and they own, operate and oversee their daily operations. Our third-party distributors and agents may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations and may not operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws, best practices, standards or regulations. In addition, our distributors may face operational disruptions or financial distress, which could cause them to suspend or shut down their operations or terminate their relationships with us. For example, a distributor that operated three of B&B’s points of sale in Texas shut down its operations in 2018 due to a business decision of its shareholders unrelated to B&B, which resulted in B&B having to replace the distributor in connection with two of the affected points of sale and to assume the direct management of the other affected point of sale. In addition, as a result of the measures adopted by the various governments to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our third-party distributors had to temporarily suspend their business and some of them have not reopened. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected and may continue to pose risks to our business, _financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”._ Our relationships with third-party distributors and agents are also exposed to risks deriving from the deterioration or failure to continue the relationship with such third-party distributors and agents as a result of unsuccessful contract renewal negotiations with our counterparts, unsatisfactory sales performance as well as any disputes that may arise in connection with the execution or as a result of the interruption of these relationships. The inability of our third-party distributors or agents to maintain the perception of prestige and high quality associated with our products could also have an adverse impact on our brands, adversely affect our ability to compete or expose us to legal claims from designers if we fail to market or sell products in accordance with the terms of our license agreements. Any disruptions in our third-party distributors’ or agents’ financial or operational conditions and any adverse changes in the relationships with our third-party distributors and agents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.9,"If our relationship with key suppliers of certain raw materials, components or finished products deteriorate or if we experience any operational difficulties with such key suppliers, our business could be adversely affected.","Each of Flos, Louis Poulsen, B&B, Fendi Casa and Audo normally sources raw materials from a diversified network of suppliers and Lumens purchases finished products from various suppliers for resale on its e-commerce site. If the relationships with certain of these key suppliers were to deteriorate, we may experience increased costs and may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers in a timely manner or in a manner that is sufficient to supply any shortfall. Such an outcome could occur if one or more of such key suppliers decides to no longer work with us, demands higher prices or more stringent payment terms or is unable to meet the quantity or quality of our product requirements, as a result of a natural disaster, pandemics, labor strikes, financial difficulties or otherwise. Certain of our supply agreements also contain expiry dates without automatic renewal provisions. In addition, Louis Poulsen’s top ten suppliers accounted for approximately 61% of its sourcing value. In particular, Louis Poulsen depends significantly on three glass component suppliers. If we experience a significant increase in demand or need to replace an existing supplier or add new suppliers to the existing ones, substitute suppliers may not exist or be prepared to supply branded products to meet our requirements. For new or substitute suppliers, we may encounter lack of capacity or delays in delivery. Moreover, a few of our products contain sophisticated high-end materials, such as mouth blown glass, the supply of which is limited. At times, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced delays in the sourcing of mouth-blown glass or of certain LED components of our lamps, resulting in limited delivery delays of our products. In addition to the above, the cost of raw materials, finished products, components necessary for our products and outsourced manufacturing activities is subject to the risk of fluctuation caused by factors beyond our control. See “—If prices of the raw materials we employ in our manufacturing processes or of the components _or finished products we purchase were to increase, our business could be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to pass any such price increases on to our customers”. Even if we were able to identify new suppliers,_ we may experience delays, increased costs, product shortages and customer back orders as we transition our product requirements to alternative suppliers. In addition, any new supplier with which we do business may be subject to the same or similar quality and quantity-related risks as our existing suppliers. Any such developments could increase our cost of sales and adversely affect our overall profit margins. 38 ----- We may also experience operational difficulties with certain suppliers, especially in connection with complex contract projects, such as a reduction in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control or failures to meet production deadlines. In addition, despite having procedures in place to monitor our suppliers, we may not be able to monitor their subcontractors or other parties, if any, to whom they have outsourced part of the manufacturing process. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers and stores on a timely basis, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In addition, whenever manufacturing activities are outsourced (such as for most of Flos’ decorative products), fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials utilized by the third-party suppliers in their manufacturing processes may also affect prices paid by us for the supply of finished or semifinished products. Most of our contractual arrangements with suppliers do not protect us from price increases and price lists are revisited quite frequently. The availability and price of raw materials and components are influenced by factors over which we have limited control, such as market conditions, general global economic prospects, production capacity, production constraints on the part of our suppliers, fluctuations in global prices, infrastructure failures, political conditions, weather conditions, regulations and other factors. The increase of energy costs experienced in 2022 impacted our operations, particularly through increased prices of our components. Increases in raw material or other component prices could place strains on our working capital requirements if we are unable to increase the prices of our products proportionally. Moreover, if we pass the increase in sourcing costs on to our customers by raising the prices of our products, which we do annually, or more frequently during periods of adverse pricing pressures, the demand for our products may decline, in particular if competitors choose not to raise prices. In turn, if we are unable to pass cost increases related to raw materials or components and other costs on to our customers, we may experience pressure on our gross margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. While generally our contracts with wholesalers are subject to price lists that we adjust annually, thus allowing us to pass through costs, many of our sales are made to customers in sales channels that do not employ sales contracts, providing us with no assurance that we will be able to continue to pass on price increases to these customers, in full or in part, or pursuant to contracts that generally allow only periodic price adjustments, which could delay our ability to pass on price increases, in full or in part, to these customers, if at all. Additionally, delays or interruptions in supply could in turn cause delays in the delivery of our products to customers, increase the chance of litigation with customers, place increased pressure on our margins and reduce our cash flow. Any of these possibilities could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as impair our ability to fulfill our financing obligations or make further investments in our business. Given that we do not normally use derivatives to hedge the price fluctuation risk of raw materials, if prices of raw materials are volatile in the future, we might need to constantly adjust our sales prices to maintain sufficient profitability, especially in an environment of rising raw material prices. In response to changes in demand levels, our competitors may price their products more aggressively in order to retain market share. Particularly during the ongoing period of price volatility and macroeconomic disruptions, we have noticed that our competitors in the decorative products market have substantially reduced the price of their offerings and implemented other aggressive marketing and sale strategies. Should these strategies endure or expand to other product segments, we may face an adverse market environment in the short term until the market reaches a new equilibrium. There may be other unforeseen effects which we cannot predict given the volatility of raw material prices. Any such event that results in a material increase in the price of raw materials or other products sourced from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 39 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

We believe that the close cooperation between our in-house research and product development and design teams and our long-standing relationships with internationally renowned designers have significantly contributed to the success of each of our brands in the global design industry. Our business depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships on satisfactory terms with leading designers. We have entered into numerous intellectual property right assignment agreements as well as exclusive or non-exclusive license agreements with our designers that enable us, pursuant to each agreement’s contractual framework, to commercially exploit (and, in certain cases, to register in our own name) the intellectual property created by these designers that makes up part of our furniture and lighting collections. Certain of our assignment agreements, however, do not explicitly transfer the underlying intellectual property rights to us or expressly grant us the right to file or register patents, designs and other intellectual property rights with respect to the assigned product shapes. Therefore, under these agreements the designer could be entitled to challenge the validity of any registration of intellectual property rights by us as well as claiming a violation of his or her rights. Moreover, under many of the assignment agreements the product shapes are assigned to us against the payment of royalties to the designer for the entire duration of the open-ended agreement, which could result in the early termination of the agreement by the designer should we not pay royalties in a timely manner. In such case, the assigned intellectual property rights could revert back to the designer. Furthermore, certain of our agreements with designers do not apply non-compete obligations upon the termination of our contractual relationship. Consequently, we are exposed to the risk that, following the termination of the agreement, the designer may license the intellectual property rights previously covered in the license agreements to third parties. This could result in a collaboration of the designer with our direct competitors, leading to a loss of our competitive position in the market. In addition, some of our employee inventors, employees and/or consultants who are or were involved in product development activities not governed by their employment contracts or other agreements have not received specific consideration for the inventive activity carried out in relation to certain patents that have been filed and granted on our behalf, which could result in claims by the employee inventors, employees and/or consultants to receive such specific consideration or to claim the moral rights on the inventions. With respect to our license agreements, we believe that our ability to negotiate, maintain and renew such agreements on satisfactory terms, particularly those that contribute to the ethos that is central to our brands, is essential to maintaining a successful product portfolio. Certain of the license agreements for Flos and, except for a small number of license agreements with key designers, most of the license agreements for B&B are for open-ended terms with provisions allowing the relevant designer to terminate the agreement at any time with prior written notice. Louis Poulsen’s license agreements do not provide for set termination dates but most grant the designers the right to terminate the agreement should certain minimum sales rates fail to be met over a specified period, or should Louis Poulsen significantly reduce or cease production of certain products. Furthermore, Louis Poulsen’s license agreements can generally be terminated by the designers in case of material breaches, including if royalties are not timely paid and following notice from the licensor. Audo license agreements are generally comparable to Louis Poulsen’s insofar as designers cannot terminate them without cause. Fendi Casa license agreements generally have a ten year term, with the option of an additional three years at the discretion of Fashion Furniture Design S.p.A. (“FF Design”) and Fendi. FF Design and Fendi have the right to terminate the agreement at any time with prior written notice. For more information, see “—The loss of certain key license agreements _could result in the loss of revenue and materially and adversely affect our business.

Our core five designers have generated approximately 49% and 51% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and for the year ended 40 ----- December 31, 2022, respectively. Although we have historically maintained positive relationships with our designers and have been able to maintain and renew key licenses, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. See “Business—Flos—Agreements with Designers”, “Business—Louis Poulsen—Agreements _with Designers”, “Business—B&B—Agreements with Designers”, “Business—Emerging Brands—Fendi Casa— Agreements with Designers” and “Business—Emerging Brands—Audo—Agreements with Designers”. The term_ of our licenses typically varies in length, with B&B licenses having either open-ended terms or, for certain key licenses, specified terms of 20 years. Flos licenses generally contain assignment rights in favor of Flos and in certain instances have open-ended terms that can be terminated by the designer at any time with notice and Louis Poulsen licenses typically feature open-ended terms that extend for the life of the copyright and contain different renewal conditions, termination clauses, license fees and royalty obligations. Audo licenses typically feature open ended terms and grant the designer the right to terminate the license at any time with prior written notice, while others are interminable for certain periods. Fendi Casa designer agreements typically have ten-year terms, with possibility of Fendi and FF Design to extend the agreement for an additional three years, at their discretion, with termination clauses primarily in favor of Fendi and FF Design. Once the licensing agreement is terminated, the intellectual property rights for the products created during the partnership remain with Fendi, while the designer typically retains the right to receive the related royalties. With respect to Fendi Casa, we entered into a license agreement with Fendi for the production, design and distribution of furniture, lighting and kitchens under the Fendi Casa brand. The term of this agreement is effective from January 1, 2022 and will terminate on the date falling 13 years from the date of effectiveness. Under this license agreement, we will pay royalties on the net sales of the Fendi Casa collection. See also “—We are exposed to risks associated with our license agreements with _designers which require us to pay royalty and other fees and, in limited cases, to make certain expenditures”._ Certain of our license agreements cannot be terminated by the licensor based on performance related criteria, although the licensor may elect not to renew the license at expiry if we do not meet their performance expectations. Some of our other license agreements contain broad termination provisions in favor of the designers, allowing the designers to terminate the license in certain circumstances, including the failure to start production, breach of obligation to obtain approval from the designer in connection with, for example, certain changes to their designs or default on royalty and other payments, among other provisions. Moreover, certain of our license agreements do not have an expiry date, which means that the relevant designer may decide to terminate their agreement at any time, with prior written notice. In addition, some of our license agreements lack non-compete clauses, meaning that, following termination, a designer would be permitted to license to third parties the intellectual property rights previously covered by the license agreement. Moreover, designers are normally free to cooperate with other companies operating in our industry on the design of products that are not covered by the license agreement which could be in competition with ours. See also “—We face significant competition in the development, production and sale of our products”. If a key designer decides to terminate a material license or otherwise requires us to cease production of a key design, or if he or she were to cooperate with our competitors in the creation of successful designs in competition with our products, the impact on our market position, our brands and our revenue may be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In our view, safeguarding each of our brand images is the basis for customer loyalty and essential to differentiate our brands from their competitors. As such, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of the brands and designs across each of our business divisions and sales channels and continue to identify products and trends that meet the expectations of our target customers. Isolated or recurring incidents that erode customer trust, such as faulty or low-quality designs, delays in delivery or suboptimal customer service, particularly if widely publicized online or litigated, and not responded to effectively, could significantly impact our brands and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a limited number of products of Flos have been recalled and B&B receives from time to time claims on defective products that it manages through standard procedures. _See “—We may be subject to product liability claims if _people or property are harmed by the products we sell”. While the foregoing instances have not had an impact on_ our reputation or financial condition, we cannot guarantee that a continuation of such cases or new cases will not adversely affect our business or our customers’ perception of our brands. In addition, if our customers view a brand and its design trend negatively during the launch of a product, it can be difficult to change those perceptions in the future. 41 ----- Moreover, some of our key designers have worked with us for several years and have significantly contributed to shape our brands throughout our history. The loss of any of our key designers, or any illegal, immoral or improper behavior of any of our key designers which is perceived negatively by the public, could adversely affect our brand image and reputation. See “—Our business is in part dependent on our ability to negotiate, maintain and renew _license agreements with leading designers on satisfactory terms” and “—The loss of certain key license agreements could result in the loss of revenue and materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, certain of our designers are not subject to non-compete obligations during the term of their license agreements with us and/or following the termination thereof, and our business could be adversely affected if they were to successfully cooperate with our competitors”._ Perception of our brands could also deteriorate if trends in luxury goods were to move away from a preference for “made in Italy” or “made in Scandinavia” goods, if we are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the protection of the environment, the sourcing, disposal, content or sale of our products or the use of customer data, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations or if we fail to deliver a consistently positive customer experience in each of our markets. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brands and other intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, including from unauthorized uses of our brand names or other intellectual property assets, can erode customer trust and our brands’ value. See “—If we are unable to protect our license and other intellectual property rights from others, _if counterfeiting increases or if our competitors or third parties assert intellectual property rights against us, our business may suffer, and we may incur significant additional costs”. Any such erosion in the perceived value of_ our brand names and designs may adversely affect our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, Flos, Louis Poulsen, B&B, Fendi Casa and Audo are each somewhat dependent on third-party distributors of their products. For example, a vast majority of our distribution network comprises mono-brand, shop-in-shops and multi-brand stores that are managed by third parties. These third-party managers typically have their own processes, sales organizations and contracts with landlords and may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with each of our brands’ standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. See “—Our failure to _effectively control our distribution network and their commercial practices could adversely affect our brand reputation. In addition, any disruption in the operations of our distributors or in our relationships with them could adversely affect our business”. Should these third-party managers misrepresent our products (e.g., in terms of_ pricing or product presentation), act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner (including with respect to environmental protection), fail to comply with laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive customer experience, the public perception of our brands may deteriorate. In addition, certain of our products are manufactured and assembled by third parties. Although we have quality assurance procedures in place to continually monitor external production and assembly which are requested to comply with the highest standard of quality, our products could be manufactured or delivered in a manner inconsistent with our standards, which could cause affect our ability to meet our customers’ expectations and adversely affect our brand reputation. In addition, while the supply chain disruptions and raw material cost increases of recent years had a limited impact on our brands, in part due to the standard supply agreements, distribution agreements and terms and conditions that specify the obligations of our partners, in the future, these measures may not protect us against material disruptions to our supply chains. Any failure on the part of these third parties to preserve and build our brands could compromise our reputation or the public’s perception of our brands, thereby diminishing the value of such brands and potentially having a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations or other matters affecting compliance with corporate governance best practices could also harm our corporate reputation. Damage to our corporate reputation or loss of customer confidence for any of these or other reasons could require additional investment to rebuild our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

While our license arrangements differ from designer to designer and across our manufacturing brands (namely, Flos, Louis Poulsen, B&B Italia, Maxalto, Azucena, Fendi Casa and Audo), most agreements provide for periodic payments of royalties or similar fees based on a percentage of net sales or a percentage of the costs incurred by the relevant company to manufacture the relevant products. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded €14.5 million in royalties to designers. In a few cases, license agreements require us to pay minimum guaranteed 42 ----- amounts and may also include advertising fees payable to the relevant designer or investments to be made by us. In addition, our license agreement with Fendi for the production, design and distribution of Fendi Casa furniture requires us to pay a royalty of net sales of the related collection as well as a minimum annual guaranteed amount and a mandatory marketing contribution. Under certain circumstances, minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees may result in us having to make payments that exceed the amount of income we are able to generate from actual sales of the licensed designs. In addition, from time to time, we may make upfront advances of royalties or loans to licensors. Furthermore, renewal of a license can lead to renegotiation of commercial terms, which may not be as favorable as the original terms. As a result, there are circumstances in which our payments to certain licensors could exceed our income earned pursuant to the relevant license, such as when we are renewing a key license or when the value of a design or perception of a designer among consumers has become impaired.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.15,We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates.,"Our reporting currency is the euro. Given we operate on an international level, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (which increased following the acquisition of Lumens), Danish Krone (which increased following the acquisition of Audo) and Yen against the euro, our reporting currency, and primarily related to (i) the fact that a portion of our revenues and costs is denominated in currencies different from our relevant reporting currency and (ii) the translation effect resulting from the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries which report in a currency different from the relevant group reporting currency (such as Louis Poulsen, which reports in Danish krone, which maintains a fixed-exchange-rate policy _vis-à-vis the Euro with a limited scope in fluctuation range). In the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived_ 43% of our revenue from sales in non-euro currencies (of which, approximately 57%, 21%, 13% and 9% of were denominated in euro, U.S. dollar, Danish krone and other currencies, respectively). Our currency translation risk is primarily related to the recognition of revenue generated by subsidiaries during our period-end consolidation and reporting. To prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Group, we translate assets, liabilities, total revenue and expenses into euro at applicable exchange rates. To determine the applicable exchange rate, assets and liabilities are converted using the exchange rates prevailing at the reference date of the relevant consolidated financial statements, and costs and revenue are converted at the average exchange rate for the relevant period. We are exposed to exchange rate transaction risks due to our international operations. Our fixed costs, such as energy, personnel and services related to production are typically denominated in the currency of the country where the relevant production facility is located (e.g., euro for Italy, U.S. dollar for the U.S., etc.). Our customer contracts are typically payable in the currency of the country where the contract is signed. By having operations worldwide, we seek to match our operating costs with operating revenue in each of the major currencies in which we operate. To the extent that we have incurred expenses that are not denominated in the same currency as related revenue, exchange rate fluctuations may, however, in some cases cause our expenses to increase or decrease as a percentage of total revenue. Continuous fluctuation in currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, particularly in relation to our cash flows, which could be affected by outstanding nominal foreign currency financial and trade receivables or payables, incurred prior to, but due to be settled after, a change to the relevant exchange rate. Changes in currency exchange rates may also have a long-term impact on demand for our products, with relative increases in the value of the euro, yen, U.S. dollar or the Danish krone, as applicable, as compared to other currencies making products more expensive for international customers and resulting in a decrease in revenue. Any increased costs or reduced revenue as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. As we generate most of our revenue and incur most of our costs in euro, we have chosen not to engage in foreign exchange hedging, as we believe that the amount of revenue generated in currencies other than the euro naturally offsets the costs incurred in such other currencies. However, Louis Poulsen normally enters into forward exchange contracts to secure sales denominated in Japanese yen, Swedish kroner and Norwegian kroner.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.16,Our cost saving measures may prove to be ineffective.,"In order to deploy cost synergies from the creation of Design Holding and further the consolidation of our Group and coordination among our brands, we have begun implementing a range of cost savings and efficiency initiatives 43 ----- aimed at streamlining our procurement strategies, which we currently expect will deliver run-rate annual cost savings for an aggregate estimated amount of €17.8 million in the next three to four years, with approximately 43% of these savings estimated to be achieved by 2024 (€1.4 million in 2023 and €6.2 million in 2024) and the remainder in 2025 (€6.6 million) and 2026 (€3.6 million). We expect to incur one-off costs in order to achieve these cost savings of approximately €3 million between 2023 and the first half of 2024 related to the fees charged by the external consultant we have engaged in connection with the implementation of these procurement optimization initiatives. Our key procurement initiatives include, among other things, streamlining our contractual relationships with suppliers through the introduction of competitive tender procedures, harmonizing of various specifications across our procurement categories, bundling various services, consolidating expenses and applying a structured supplier qualification process. For more information on our procurement optimization initiatives, see “Our Business—Our Strategies—Significant opportunity from new procurement cost saving initiatives under _implementation”._ The achievement of these cost savings partly depends on factors that are outside of our control, including the renegotiation of certain contract terms with our suppliers, and we may therefore be unable to implement some or all of such initiatives and/or generate the expected benefits therefrom within the expected timeframe or at all. Furthermore, the costs we incur in trying to realize these cost savings initiatives and other benefits described herein may be substantially higher than our current estimates, including due to the impact on the economy and our business of the current inflationary surge and uncertain macroeconomic environment, and may outweigh any benefit. As a result, we may not be able to achieve some or all of our targeted cost savings or incur additional unexpected costs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

For those of our products that are not made to order (such as Flos’ decorative collection and certain of LP’s wholesale products) and/or that are produced externally (such as most outdoor products and certain product components of B&B), we often forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our third-party suppliers and manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand. Although we frequently adjust our estimates to reflect demand trends and have not experienced material issues in the past notwithstanding the negative consumer sentiment, inflationary pressures and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to accurately forecast demand for such products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in demand for our products or for our competitors’ products, unanticipated changes in general market conditions and changes in economic conditions. For a description of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business and results of operations, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations— COVID-19”. See also “—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to may continue to pose risks to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”._ If we underestimate demand for a particular product, our third-party manufacturers and suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of that product or material to meet our requirements, and we may experience increased delivery times or a shortage of that product available for sale or distribution. The shortage of a popular product or an increase in delivery times could adversely affect our brand, our customer relationships and our ability to attract additional customers. Alternatively, inventory levels in excess of demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at further discounted prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, Lumens does not manufacture any products in house and, once orders are received, depending on the availability of such products at Lumens’ warehouse, the company either ships on-hand products directly or instructs the relevant vendor to mail directly to the customer. Any failure by these vendors to properly and timely manage the preparation and shipping of our customers’ orders may harm Lumens’ and our reputation and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

(“Ares”) owns three production facilities and two warehouses in Italy; Flos’ Antares subsidiary owns its headquarters in Spain; Louis Poulsen leases a manufacturing facility and warehouse in Denmark and warehouses in the United States, Japan and Singapore; B&B owns two manufacturing facilities and operates two leased warehouses and one 44 ----- manufacturing facility in Italy for Arclinea; Fendi Casa leases a manufacturing facility in Misinto as well as a warehouse for finished products, and enters into commercial lease agreements covering its stores, including its flagship store in Milan (which also houses the Fendi Casa headquarters); and Audo closed two manufacturing sites in 2023, now relying exclusively on outsourced production. A majority of Flos’ and Audo’s products and a limited percentage of Louis Poulsen’s products are manufactured pursuant to their specifications by third-party manufacturers or are otherwise sourced as input parts from third-party suppliers. Lumens does not manufacture any products in house. In addition, our finished products are delivered to our customers internationally from our distribution centers in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United States and Asia. The orderly operation of our manufacturing and delivery processes depends on adherence to manufacturing, assembling and shipping schedules and effective management of the facilities through which we and other third-party manufacturers operate. All of these facilities are subject to operational risk, including, but not limited to: - equipment failure or interruptions in power supplies; - failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards; - failure to maintain necessary permits and approvals; - material supply disruptions; - adverse changes in export duties, including as a result of tariffs and quotas; - labor force shortages or work stoppages; - environmental conditions; - events impeding or increasing the cost of transporting our products, including enhanced security measures at U.S. and other international ports; - adverse changes in the general economic, social or political conditions in the countries in which the facilities are located; - natural or man-made disasters; - fires or floods; and - terrorist attacks or political unrest. Any significant disruption in operations to our manufacturing facilities or our distribution centers resulting from these or other events may, to the extent not covered by our business interruption insurance or if such insurance claims are not paid promptly, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, due to extreme storms in the northern parts of Italy in July 2023, our factory located in Misinto (operated by DQM and B&B Italia) experienced damage that caused disruptions in their operations. By activating available measures to minimize the damage, management was able to timely restore operations for DQM, whereas B&B is currently operating at reduced pace and is estimated to restore operations in November 2023. Although we do not expect these extraordinary events to have had a material adverse effect on the operations of B&B Italia and DQM, an initial insurance claim has been filed, including in connection with B&B business interruption, and documentation to support the insurance claim is in the process of being collected. See “—Our _insurance coverage could prove inadequate”. Some of the components we manufacture in-house, such as large_ foam components of B&B sofas, may be difficult to source externally, and any material disruption in the relevant production machinery could cause severe delays in the delivery of such products. In addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing merchandise to our customers during the time it takes for us to reopen, restore or replace our manufacturing or assembly facilities or warehouses and any refund from our business interruption insurance may prove to be insufficient. In addition, pursuant to Italian law, companies might be required to return certain of their sites to certain local development organizations upon termination of operations in such sites. In this regard, litigation is currently pending in relation to an inoperative non-core asset located in Ascoli Piceno, Italy owned by B&B against the local industrial development consortium. The latter claims a right to obtain the property of such site without any compensation to be paid to B&B. The site at contention is currently recorded in B&B’s balance sheets at a value of approximately €2 million. 45 ----- In addition to our manufacturing and assembly operations, we rely upon various means of transportation, primarily provided by third parties, to deliver products from third-party manufacturers or assemblers to our warehouses and from our warehouses to our customers. Labor shortages or capacity constraints in the transportation industry, financial distress or bankruptcy of our couriers, disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure, domestic and international travel restrictions, fuel shortages or transportation cost increases (such as increases in fuel costs or port fees) could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, including as a result of any material adverse effect on Lumens’ business, which resorts to third parties for the distribution of products to its customers. For example, in 2020, we experienced delays in delivering products from third-party manufacturers or assemblers to our warehouses and from our warehouses to our customers, due to the closure of these manufacturers or assemblers facilities and/or to the travel restrictions imposed by certain governments to limit the spread of the COVID-19 infection. In addition, B&B experienced certain operational issues relating to planning and order scheduling that affected B&B’s performance in the first half of 2020 and which were promptly resolved by the second half of the year. Similarly, in 2021, Flos experienced several months of delays in the delivery of components sourced from China as a result of global disruptions impacting supply chains. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to may continue to pose risks to _our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”.

Credit risk in these countries and in other Eurozone countries could have a negative impact on our business. Concerns also remain regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual euro member states. In addition, continued hostilities in Ukraine and the Middle East and tensions in North Africa and Eastern Europe and other world events could continue to adversely affect the economies of the European Union (the “EU”) and those of other countries, which were severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, negatively impacted by increased inflationary pressures, increased energy prices and supply chain disruptions caused, in part, by the ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine. Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the European Commission and EU member states to counterbalance the negative consequences of an economic downturn, high inflation and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to overcome endemic issues related to debt burdens of certain countries in Europe, the overall stability of the Eurozone, the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU, the influx of refugees in certain European countries and the rise of populism in Europe. The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, effective January 1, 2021 (“Brexit”), has created lingering uncertainty about the future relationship among the United Kingdom, the European Union and its remaining member states and may constitute an additional risk for the financial markets and the European economy. While the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed to a comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement, which came into force provisionally on January 1, 2021, Brexit has led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the borders of the United Kingdom and the European Union as well as a lack of haulage and other qualified supply chain and logistics workers, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom. In addition, there is ongoing uncertainty with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the United Kingdom continues to determine which EU-derived laws to replace, replicate or modify following its exit from the European Union, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws and employment laws. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what long-term financial, trade and legal implications Brexit will have and whether and how our business could be affected. This uncertainty could increase costs, depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the abandonment of the euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the European and, in particular, the Italian economy and therefore us. This is because Italy represents a significant market for us and is where a large portion of our products are manufactured. As such, we would be particularly affected by the occurrence of any such events. The departure 46 ----- of Italy from the euro would increase our exposure to changes in currency rates and may result in the imposition of exchange controls, among other economic measures. Any of these developments could affect our ability to refinance our liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

COVID-19 had a significant impact on Italy’s economy and its public finances, due to a decline in tourism, weaker consumer spending and lower industrial production. The Italian economy grew by 7.0% in 2021 and had recovered most of the pandemic-incurred output losses by year-end. However, Italy’s economic growth started slowing down last year, halting the post-pandemic rebound which had lifted growth to 7.0% in 2021 and 3.7% in 2022. GDP decreased by 0.4% quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter of 2023, driven by falling domestic demand. Any downgrades of the Italian sovereign debt could create additional economic uncertainty and could have an adverse effect on our credit ratings. We may also be affected by political uncertainty in Italy, the emergence of which may negatively impact business confidence. While the current government is supported by a majority of the Italian parliament, coalition governments in Italy have in the past failed, and it remains unclear whether the current government will be able to adequately address impediments to the country’s growth, including as a result of a global economic slowdown or the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the ratio of sovereign debt to GDP, the write-down of non-performing loans and the reduction of unemployment in Italy. In addition, the deployment of funds destined to boost Italy’s economic performance over the next years pursuant to the Recovery and Resilience Plan adopted by the Italian government is tied to the government being able to implement the reform plan pre-agreed with the European Commission. Therefore, a failure to effectively and timely implement these reforms and apply the recovery package funding might directly impact Italy’s position within the European Union and negatively affect its economic growth. Furthermore, the government may take positions that further exacerbate economic uncertainty in Italy which, in turn, may contribute to recessionary conditions and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. The continued impact of the adverse global, European and Italian economic and market conditions, including, among others, the current and lingering effects of geopolitical tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—We are affected by _general economic conditions worldwide, and unfavorable economic conditions could result in a decline in the demand for our products and a material adverse effect on our financial performance” and “—The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected and may continue to pose risks to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”._",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Various governments around the world, including Italy, adopted measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. These measures, along with decreased consumer spending and widespread uncertainty following months of lockdowns and other restrictive orders, led to an economic downturn in our markets and had a direct impact on our business across all of the countries in which we operated at the time. In particular, several of the governments of such countries imposed significant lockdown measures in order to control the spread of COVID-19, including the government of Italy, which imposed the temporary closure of all of our manufacturing facilities and the stores in which our products are sold. Similar measures were adopted by the governments of several other countries in which we operate. Although the nationwide lockdowns were gradually lifted (e.g., on May 4, 2020, in Italy), significant restrictions and social distancing measures were imposed. The COVID-19 pandemic affected our financial performance in the periods under review across our operations, exerting downward pressure on global sales as a result of government regulatory constraints. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred €1.7 million of costs related to COVID-19, such as cost for enhanced safety measures in our plants, stores and offices, increased shipping costs, and non-reimbursable costs that we incurred for setting up fairs that were cancelled. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other _Data—Other Financial and As Adjusted Data”. In addition, in the fall of 2020, Italy was affected by a resurgence_ of rising COVID-19 case levels, resulting in a regional lockdown. Other international European markets in which we operate, as well as countries from which we source our products, were also affected by lockdowns and similar measures. 47 ----- While COVID-19 has largely subsided in most regions of the world following the global vaccine campaign, resurgences or further outbreaks of the virus may occur. There can be no assurance that measures currently in place and/or the existing vaccines will be successful in combatting any new strains of the virus. In addition, we may continue to experience an adverse impact on our business as a result of the global economic after-effects, including impact of the measures taken by central banks to curtail inflation, and any recession that has occurred or may occur as a result thereof. For example, difficult macroeconomic conditions, such as adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, a decline in consumer confidence, increased and prolonged unemployment, declines in per capita income and levels of discretionary spending, increases in taxation and loss of personal wealth could adversely affect demand for our products and contract services. We cannot predict if, when or where further waves of COVID-19 will occur, how far into the future such waves will continue to occur nor can we predict with any level of certainty the impacts of any such subsequent waves, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by the governments and/or local or regional authorities of the countries in which we operate. There may be a decrease in demand for our products in the event of further resurgences of COVID-19 or the occurrence of other pandemics, public health emergencies or threats, any of which may necessitate regulatory responses, resulting in temporary store closures, modified store operating hours, a decrease in customer traffic, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions, cancellation of events or disruptions to our supply chain, among other effects, any of which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, it may also have the effect of heightening any or all of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.

Retention of senior management is important in our business due to the limited availability of experienced and talented executives. We have put in place policies and remuneration designed to retain and incentivize management; however, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to retain and properly incentivize management or to find suitable replacements should any of them leave us. Competition for such personnel is significant, and we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future. We also face the challenge of attracting, developing and retaining qualified staff for our directly operated stores, manufacturing plants, distribution centers and aftermarket services teams while controlling our labor costs. Our ability to support our strategy may be limited by our ability to employ, train, motivate and retain sufficient skilled personnel such as manufacturing staff, store managers, and aftermarket service providers. There can be no assurance that we will continue to employ any of these key personnel or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future.

In particular, Flos’ Architectural and Outdoor divisions provide lighting products primarily for sophisticated, high-end commercial applications including retail stores, hotels, offices and outdoor markets, and, from time to time, exclusive residential properties. Louis Poulsen’s B2B business comprises sales to specifiers in professional projects, such as architects, lighting designers, interior designers and building engineers, of both indoor and outdoor lighting products. B&B’s Contract division delivers custom “turn-key” furniture solutions and finishes in the residential, hospitality, retail and office sectors. Lumens’ sales to contract customers consist of sales to electrical suppliers, purchasing agents and wholesale distributors, purchasing products for commercial projects including hotels, restaurants and office spaces. Fendi Casa’s contract distribution channel offers project management and custom design services to residential and commercial customers. Audo’s B2C and contract business comprises sales of customized or catalog products for projects such as restaurants, hotels, apartments and offices. Overall, for twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated €257.3 million and €233.9 million of revenue from our Group contract segments. 48 ----- Contract projects are generally complex and must be completed to high, bespoke specifications. Although we typically request advance payments on contract projects in order to minimize credit risk, given the inherent complexity, large scale and extended duration of these projects, we remain exposed to financial risks related to, among other things, the non-performance of a contract due to bankruptcy or other operational or financial issues of the counterparty, as well as the delay of a project decided by our customer. Moreover, especially in connection with B&B’s bigger contract business, when we do receive advance payments, we may from time to time be required to provide customers with bank guarantees and/or performance bonds, which could be enforced if we were to default on our contractual obligations for any reasons, including as a consequence of a delay from one of our suppliers. As of December 31, 2022, Group bank guarantees and performance bonds given to third parties amounted to approximately €7.2 million, approximately €6.0 million of which related to contracts of B&B. Contract projects also expose our brands to significant litigation risks due to the non-performance of a contract arising out of difficulties with suppliers, transportation systems or manufacturing facilities. Any failure to comply with the contract project delivery deadline, in some cases, subjects us to penalties established in relation to each day of delay, along with indirect damages, to be paid to the customer. Delays may also be deemed cause for termination of the contract. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had set aside provisions of €2.1 million and €3.3 million, respectively, in connection with these and other minor pending legal proceedings. Furthermore, the scale of each project, as well as the wide visibility on certain commercial projects, exposes each company to reputational harm should they fail to meet the client’s expectations regarding project design or product quality.

We may face competition from other retailers for suitable locations and we may also face difficulties in negotiating leases on acceptable terms. In addition, a lack of available financing on terms acceptable to real estate developers or a tightening credit market may adversely affect the retail sites available to us. Rising real estate and acquisition, construction and development costs and available lease financing could also inhibit our ability to open or acquire new stores. Our growth strategy is also highly dependent on our e-commerce activities and our ability to reach customers worldwide, in particular in the lighting industry. Due to the low barrier to entry to online platforms, we may face intensified competition from other high-end design stores that are also growing their presence online via e-commerce. Moreover, creating an e-commerce platform might entail difficulties in certain geographies, such as Europe due to its high fragmentation, or might not be successful for certain of our products (such as furnishing products, for which customer on-site visits and customization services play an important role), and may also adversely affect our relationships with existing online retailers. Our expansion into new and existing markets via physical locations or e-commerce may present competitive, distribution, merchandising and regulatory challenges that differ from our current challenges, including competition among our stores, diminished novelty of our store design and concept, added strain on our distribution centers, additional information to be processed by our information technology systems and diversion of management attention from operations. As we grow our e-commerce activities and as we open stores in new markets, where we are less familiar with consumer trends and buying patterns and our brands are less well-known, we may face different or additional risks and increased costs compared to opening new stores in existing markets. For example, we may not accurately predict consumer preferences in new markets, which could result in lowerthan-expected sales. A growing online presence and expansion into new markets could also bring us into direct competition with retailers with whom we have no past experience as direct competitors. To the extent that we are not able to meet these new challenges, our sales could decrease and our operating costs could increase. Furthermore, our margins may be impacted in periods in which incremental expenses are incurred as a result of new store openings.

Some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have high levels of corruption. Our continued expansion and worldwide operations, including in developing countries, the development of joint venture relationships worldwide and the employment of local agents in the countries in which we operate increases the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, OFAC or similar laws. As a result, from time to time we may be subject to proceedings and investigations relating to such laws and regulations. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts (and termination of existing contracts) and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, any major violations could have a significant impact on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business. While we believe that we have a strong culture of compliance and adequate systems of control, we seek to continuously improve our systems of internal controls and to remedy any weaknesses identified. There can be no assurance, however, that the policies and procedures have been or will be followed at all times (including by companies that we acquired) or effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of our directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents or partners and, as a result, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the contract division generated 33% and 29% of Louis Poulsen’s total revenue. Although Louis Poulsen’s contract customers represent a wide range of industries, the vast majority of contract Outdoor customers are public entities primarily located in Denmark, but also in other European countries as well as the U.S. where Louis Poulsen uses a distributor to service Outdoor contract customers. As a result, a significant portion of Louis Poulsen’s revenue is dependent on governments’ and public authorities’ programs and funding policies, as well as economic and political conditions. As governments and other public entities suffer from budget deficits, changes in regulations and changes in sentiment around public spending, their capacity to fund high-end designs from Louis Poulsen’s contract division could be materially affected. As a consequence of poor economic conditions or budget cuts, governments or local public authorities may call off or reconsider potential projects, exercise their right to terminate contracts, attempt to renegotiate contract terms in order to reduce costs or delay the time of payment, exposing Louis Poulsen to a significantly reduced demand for new contracts or increased credit risk on existing contracts. Any decrease in spending by public sector entities on commercial lighting projects could adversely affect Louis Poulsen’s profit margin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

If our computer servers or communications hardware fail, or if we suffer from an interruption or degradation of technology services, we could lose customer data and miss order fulfillment deadlines, which could harm our business through exposure to litigation or reputational harm. Our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, data loss, acts of war, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. In addition, some of the digital data we collect and process are stored and managed by third-party infrastructure operators that manage the servers underlying our IT platform, and any data security thefts, cyber-attacks or other material disruption affecting such operators could in turn adversely affect our operations and relationships with our customers. Our revenue depends in part on the number of visitors who shop on our sites and on the volume of orders we can handle. Unavailability of our sites or reduced order fulfillment performance would reduce the volume of goods sold and could also materially adversely affect consumer perception of our brand. See “—We face certain risks in relation to e-commerce and _online revenue”._ 51 ----- In addition, continued growth in our transaction volume, as well as surges in online traffic and orders associated with promotional activities or launches in our business, could place additional demands on our technology platform and could cause or exacerbate slowdowns or interruptions. If there is a substantial increase in the volume of traffic on our sites or the number of orders placed by customers, we will be required to further expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases, if any, in the use of our sites or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases on a timely basis. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our sites and our information technology (“IT”) systems and infrastructure. This is particularly challenging given the rapid rate at which new technologies, customer preferences and expectations and industry standards and practices are evolving. In order to keep pace with these evolving trends, we have from time to time redesigned and enhanced and we are currently redesigning and enhancing various functions on our sites and/or our IT systems and infrastructure and we may experience instability and performance issues as a result of these changes. Our disaster recovery plan may be inadequate, and our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses that could occur. Any slowdown or failure of our sites and the underlying technology infrastructure could harm our reputation and impede our ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the current and future Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI”) and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply, including in connection with any possible payment card data breach. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the 52 ----- volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines, penalties, assessments or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card and debit card payments from consumers or to facilitate other types of online payments. In addition, the card brands and our bank could compel us to complete more robust PCI questionnaires and reports, especially in the event of a data breach. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders. While we have an agreement in place with our payment provider, which also includes fraud prevention, this does not prevent attempts of fraudulent purchases. In addition, given our product offering, the online payments that we process are typically of a higher amount than in other industries. As a result, any losses that we may suffer as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data could be substantial. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions. Furthermore, we may also be subject to cyber-attacks that compromise our customers’ credit card data. See “— _More stringent regulations, including in the area of consumer data privacy, product safety and ESG could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations”.

In the ordinary course of business, we are required to process the personal data of our customers. The regulatory environment governing the use of individually identifiable data of customers, employees and others is complex. Privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently and compliance with them may require us to incur costs to make necessary system changes and implement new administrative processes. Any processing of the personal data of individuals located in the European Economic Area in the course of the provision of services is governed by the EU data protection regime, which restricts our ability to collect, process and use personally identifiable information relating to customers, potential customers, business partners, and employees, including for marketing purposes. On May 24, 2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”) with the aim to, among other things, strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the EU. The GDPR became effective in each EU Member State on May 25, 2018, replacing the former European data protection regulatory framework. The GDPR, together with the Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, as amended by Legislative Decree no. 101/2018 (the “Italian Privacy Code”), increased our regulatory burden, in terms of compliance with the new rules, as well as the maximum level of fines for non-compliance. In particular, the GDPR obligates European Union-based companies or companies that process personal data about European Union subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate, for example, to (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security and confidentiality, (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability), (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing, (iv) the obligation to ensure rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification and the right to erasure, and (v) more onerous consent requirements, as consent will always have to be express/opt-in, while implied/opt-out consent has at times been deemed sufficient under the former regime. The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of data. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in significant penalties including fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). In addition, according to the Italian Privacy Code, certain criminal sanctions could be applied to individuals involved in unlawful processing activities. Our data security insurance coverage is limited and we cannot guarantee that our data security insurance coverage or our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Moreover, evolving regulation relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs and affect or limit the way through which we collect, process, use, store and transfer personal data. Compliance with, and monitoring of such laws and regulations is demanding, time consuming and costly. Further, such laws and regulations, including their interpretation and application, change from time to time, and such changes could impose new burdens and expose us to further liability, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, in the aftermath of personnel initiatives implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such 53 ----- as a reliance on remote working, as well as an increased amount of employee health data being processed, our exposure to this risk is heightened. The European Commission has proposed enhanced regulations concerning privacy and electronic communications (the “e-Privacy Regulation”), which would entail additional and stricter rules than those established under the GDPR in respect of the use of personal data from electronic communications. The e-Privacy Regulation would establish fines similar to those included in GDPR. These regulations may affect the development of innovative services that would draw on consumer data, potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for undertakings subject to both the GDPR and the e-Privacy Regulation. If we were found to be subject to and in violation of any of these laws or other data privacy laws or regulations, we would likely be required to change our business practices and may be exposed to litigation and regulatory penalties and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If a data security breach occurs, our reputation could be damaged and we could experience lost sales, fines or lawsuits. The customer data could be either stolen or misappropriated at any stage of data processing, such as receipt, transmission, use or storage of the data. If any loss or misappropriation were to occur, customers may be unwilling to provide us with their data and direct marketing could be negatively affected as a result. Furthermore, a loss or misappropriation of customer data could result in negative publicity, which could damage our reputation and result in lower sales. Finally, our operations are subject to certain environmental, product safety and other laws and regulations applicable to our products. Any change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export products to certain markets, result in increased production or distribution costs or require us to replace certain raw materials or components at higher cost, which could cause delays in the delivery of our products. For example, in 2018, the U.S. introduced certain bans on formaldehyde-releasing agents which are often found in, among other things, resins used in the manufacture of composite wood products, glues, paints, coatings and lacquers. As a result of these new rules, B&B had to adjust its manufacturing processes to ensure that no such agents were contained in its products, which caused minor delays in the delivery of certain products to the U.S. B&B’s general approach to such situations is to promptly adapt its manufacturing standards and processes to the highest industry standards required by the laws of the countries in which it operates, as these may change from time to time. Although, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, this change did not result in any material cost increases, there can be no assurance that future changes in environmental, product safety or other regulations would not result in material increases in raw material costs or delays in production for B&B or any of our other companies. Moreover, there is a global trend towards climate-related financial disclosure. A number of countries have established mandatory disclosure regimes and/or set timelines for the implementation of legislation regarding mandatory climate-related disclosure requirements. For example, the European Commission has established a number of sustainability-related reporting and compliance regimes, including the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which will enhance the scope and reporting requirements under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, as well as proposals for new regulatory regimes that are aimed at, for example, prohibiting corporates from placing or making available on the EU market or exporting from the EU market products made with forced labor; requiring companies to identify, prevent, bring to an end, mitigate and account for adverse human rights and environmental impacts in operations, subsidiaries and value chains; and enhancing gender pay reporting requirements. For example, the operations of certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the so-called “EU Timber Regulation”, which came into force on March 3, 2013 and requires that only timber and timber products (among which pulp and paper) produced in accordance with the legislation of the timber-producing country enter the European market, prohibiting trade of illegally harvested timber or products derived from such timber in the European market and requiring operators to exercise “due diligence” to provide detailed information on the supply chain of timber products. The EU Timber Regulation will soon be repealed by the so-called “EU Zero Deforestation Regulation”, which aims to further implement the objectives of the EU Timber Regulation, broaden its scope so as to cover all products, directly or indirectly, linked to deforestation and further define the obligations imposed on operators. Our operations in the European Union, as well as any global product sales into the European Union, may bring us in scope of these requirements. Any such change in regulation, any theft or misappropriation of customer data, or any failure to abide by other laws or regulations governing data privacy or other areas of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the European Commission’s proposed European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (if implemented), which complements the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which came into force in January 2023, and any other existing or future regulation or legislation related to ethical sourcing, may or will require companies to carry out due diligence along their supply chains and identify and act on adverse environmental and human rights impacts across their organization, and potentially their entire value chain. Failure 54 ----- to meet such requirements could trigger the additional risk of exposure to inquiries from supervisory bodies and adversely affect our reputation and brand, or could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operation through lost revenue and the cost of any required remedial actions, penalties or claims for damages.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Pursuant to LD 231/2001, each of Design Holding, Flos, B&B Italia and Arclinea have implemented internal controls and monitoring systems aimed at detecting and preventing such conduct, whereas Fendi Casa and DQM are working towards their implementation. Although the Design Holding, Flos, B&B Italia, and Arclinea have maintained and utilized these controls and monitoring systems, these systems may be unable to detect or prevent every instance of unethical conduct involving our directors, employees, consultants, partners, internal and third-party agents, representatives and intermediaries. In addition, any of the above-mentioned companies may fail to adequately update such systems. Even if implemented, updated and maintained, these monitoring systems, including internal controls and procedures at each of the said companies, may not be sufficient to protect, detect and identify inadequate practices or violations of law. Any of the foregoing circumstances, including our failure to adequately comply with or implement any relevant regulatory changes, may expose us to civil and administrative penalties, including pursuant to the provisions of LD 231/2001, as well as to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences. In particular, pursuant to LD 231/2001, we may be held responsible for certain crimes committed in Italy or abroad (including, among others, corruption, fraud against the state, corporate offenses, market abuse, certain environmental violations and workplace safety violations) in our interest or for our benefit by individuals having a functional relationship with us at the time the relevant crime was committed, including third-party agents, partners or intermediaries, unless we were able to prove that such individuals fraudulently violated such internal control model and it was impossible for us to avoid such violation. In such circumstances, we may be subject to fines, confiscation of profits or legal sanctions, including, subject to certain conditions, the termination of authorizations, permits, licenses, concessions and financing arrangements, including facilitated financing, suspension of our operations, or prohibitions on contracting with public authorities. The duration of these disqualifications ranges from a minimum of three months to a maximum of two years, although in very serious cases, some of these disqualifications can be applied permanently. Certain of the abovementioned legal sanctions may also be applied as interim measures during investigations. As an alternative to the legal sanctions, the court may appoint a judicial custodian to run the company, with the consequence that the profits gained during the receivership period are automatically confiscated.

For example, unseasonable weather conditions may reduce footfall in certain shopping areas and reduce demand for certain product categories, such as outdoor furniture from the B&B Italia Outdoor line and outdoor lighting from Flos and Louis Poulsen, which could also have an impact on our quarterly results. We may be impacted by seasonality occurring in connection with the launch of new products, increased demand for indoor lighting during the darker winter months and promotions associated with Black Friday in November and Christmas in December. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements reach their highest level in the third quarter, when our brands ramp up their production and internal sales efforts in preparation for new product launches and increased customer demand during the fourth quarter. Due to our significant fixed cost base, represented by rent and employee wages and salaries, if we experience lower sales during the fourth quarter or other periods of high demand, we may be unable to reduce our costs in the short term to offset the lower revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Demands on our logistics chain also fluctuate during the year in response to seasonal trends in our business. For example, the weeks immediately preceding the holiday selling season in the fourth quarter are a particularly 55 ----- demanding period for some parts of our logistics organization, as well as the weeks immediately preceding the summer season for our outdoor products, as inventory volumes tend to be higher to cope with anticipated demand. Any disruption in our supply or logistics chain during that period would therefore have an outsized effect on our results of operations. See also “—Any disruption relating to our manufacturing or assembly facilities or _warehouses or to our distribution and delivery processes could have a materially adverse impact on our business”._ As a result of the foregoing factors, our results of operations may fluctuate on a seasonal basis, as well as relative to corresponding periods in prior years. We may also engage in marketing campaigns that could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in a particular quarter or selling season. Due to the seasonality inherent in the lighting and furnishings industry, period-on-period comparisons of our results of operations may not necessarily be meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.34,"In case we carry out acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, they may not deliver anticipated benefits.","We have acquired in the recent past companies or assets in the high-end design market or adjacent markets as a key part of our growth strategy. Although we are currently focused on delivering organic growth by further developing and consolidating our brands, in the event we acquire any additional companies or assets, any such transactions could be significant or transformational in size and importance for us. The success of such transactions is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on terms that are favorable for us, complete such transactions and integrate the acquired businesses. The acquisition of further companies in the future depends on, among other things, the existence of suitable acquisition targets and our ability to finance their acquisition. If we carry out acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate expected margins or cash flows or realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including expected growth or synergies in time anticipated or at all. For example, following our acquisition of Audo, the company was impacted by a sharp increase of freight costs, as well as increases in inventory levels and net debt, which required us to implement a recovery plan to contain additional expenses and regulate margins. Our analysis and assessments of potential targets are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations. There can be no assurance that our assessments and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. For example, companies that we acquire may be subject to revised valuations, which may be lower than our pre-acquisition expectations. As a result, we may be exposed to, for example, legal challenges by various parties on the assessed value, which may expose us to arbitration or litigation proceedings, causing us to incur unexpected additional costs from our acquisitions. We may also encounter difficulties identifying potential targets, which would interrupt our process of growth by acquisitions and we may forego development opportunities, with negative impacts on the speed of realization of our growth objectives. Furthermore, we may use debt financing for any acquisitions, which could be material and would in any event increase our debt service requirements, or we may use operating cash flows to finance acquisitions, which would decrease our retained earnings and the amount of cash on our balance sheet. In order to manage any acquisitions, we successfully complete, we will need to expand and continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems. Our excess cash may be limited, and we may not be able to invest in the acquired company to integrate the acquired business and achieve the desired synergies. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and synergies may be affected by a number of difficulties and risks, including, but not limited to: - the loss of customers, suppliers or key employees; - our ability to reduce expenses by eliminating duplicative overhead and functions and rationalizing manufacturing and/or distributing capacity in a timely manner; - our ability to optimize procurement savings with respect to raw materials and other supplies; - unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, financial, accounting, cultural or other issues which we may not be able to identify as part of our due diligence activities; - difficulty in standardizing existing information and systems and consolidating facilities and infrastructure; - failure to maintain the quality of the products that is associated with our existing brands; - added costs caused by dealing with such disruptions; 56 ----- - unforeseen challenges from operating in new geographic areas; and - the diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day management as a result of the need to deal with the aforementioned disruptions and difficulties. If we are unable to address, among others, the above-mentioned risks, they could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including any targeted operational and organizational synergies. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, in spite of the due diligence we perform, we may inadvertently or unknowingly acquire actual or potential liabilities, including legal claims, claims for breach of contract, local authority proceedings, employment related claims, environmental liabilities, anti-corruption and sanctions law violations or tax liabilities. Acquisitions may also include earn-out clauses to the seller that we may not be able to satisfy if our financial results have deteriorated since the acquisition. For example, the Audo share purchase agreement provides, among others, that in addition to the purchase price, the seller thereunder would be entitled to an earn-out for an amount of DKK 80 million (approximately €10.8 million as of December 31, 2022 by applying an exchange rate of 7.44 DKK per euro) in case Audo’s turnover for the financial year 2023 reaches DKK 529.4 million (approximately €71 million by applying an exchange rate of 7.44 DKK per euro). While we do not consider reaching the threshold identified above probable, and did not recognize any financial liability in relation to such earn-out, should we be required to satisfy the foregoing earn-out or any other earn-outs agreed in future acquisitions, we may be experience material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, to the extent we divest any of our businesses, we may also incur contingent liabilities in connection with any indemnity we provide to the purchaser in connection with such divestiture. If any of the above were to materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any future acquisitions, particularly material or transformational acquisitions of larger businesses or business units, may prove more difficult to integrate into our business, increasing the risk that such acquisitions may not be successful. Transformational or material acquisitions would require significant financial and operating resources and we do not have experience undertaking such large acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions of businesses outside our core geographical markets may present additional challenges due to legal, cultural and linguistic differences and the difficulties presented by integrating and managing a business that is geographically more remote. Moreover, transformational or material acquisitions may result in unfavorable external perceptions of the transaction or us, creating the potential for ratings downgrades or adversely affecting the market price of the Notes. Similarly, any acquisitions of businesses operating in adjacent market segments could further exacerbate the difficulties in integrating such businesses. Future acquisition opportunities and mergers may require approvals from antitrust and other authorities under antitrust or other regulation in force at the time in any one of a number of jurisdictions. For instance, if such approvals of a proposed acquisition or merger prove necessary, approval of the transaction may require, based on the relevant antirust authority’s evaluation of prevailing market conditions and our position in the market, that we divest certain businesses in order to carry out the transaction. We may also be prohibited by antitrust authorities from carrying out the transaction. Furthermore, we could, as a consequence of our strong positions in certain of our markets, be considered by antitrust regulatory authorities to have a dominant position which could subject us to certain limitations in our ability to act on the market by adjusting our prices or otherwise. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, we may enter into joint ventures, business alliances or collaboration agreements, which could involve the same or similar risks and uncertainties as are involved in acquisitions. Joint ventures generally involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, which may in the future present financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks. We may invest substantial amounts in these joint ventures and cannot be assured that they will produce expected returns. Any inability to achieve projected synergies or properly address operational risks, either with regard to joint ventures or acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

With respect to Fendi Casa, we exercise control over the brand pursuant to specific agreements that regulate governance in partnership with Maison Fendi. Although we are the controlling 57 ----- shareholder of the joint venture through our wholly owned subsidiary, DQM, the operation of the joint venture is subject to management risks and uncertainties, mainly due to the possible emergence of differences between us and Maison Fendi on the identification and achievement of operational and strategic objectives, as well as the difficulty of resolving any conflicts between us arising during the ordinary management of FF Design and Fendi Casa. As a result, we may not be able to pursue the strategic and operational objectives of the joint venture should there be differences between the partners. The success of the joint venture or any future joint venture requires that the partners constructively pursue the same goals. If we were to decide to divest our shareholding or to withdraw from the joint venture, we might not be able to find a buyer for our shares or be able to sell such shares for other reasons, or our joint venture partner may claim damages. In our joint venture agreement with Maison Fendi, we have also undertaken various obligations. If we were to fail to fulfill such obligations, in whole or in part, we could become subject to claims for damages and contractual penalties or the relevant joint venture agreement could be terminated. In addition, a breach of contract by joint venture partners or unforeseen events may impair the successful implementation of a project. Additionally, it is possible that our partners may use, outside of the scope of the joint venture project, technologies or know-how acquired in the course of the joint venture or otherwise misappropriate trade secrets or competitive advantages from the relationship. If any of these risks were to materialize, we might lose orders and customers and jeopardize our strategic market position in the relevant markets which, in turn, may result in a time-consuming and costly search for alternative partners and the loss of investments already made. The occurrence of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are dependent on a network of third-party retailers marketing and selling our products in monobrand stores and shop-in-shops to end customers. Any deterioration in our relationship with such third-party retailers, for example because of supply issues or changed procedures and requirements imposed by us that adversely impact, or that are perceived by such third-party retailers to adversely impact, third-party retailers, could impact our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, we spent approximately €49.3 million and €53.1 million, respectively, on marketing and public relations expenses, representing 5.8% and 6.3% of our total revenue for the same respective periods. There can be no assurance that such advertising and promotional activities will be successful, will target customers in our core markets or will be relevant to the markets for high-end designer furnishings and lighting. For example, our marketing campaigns featuring celebrities and social media influencers may not be well received if the reputation of one of these celebrities or influencers is undermined. See “—Use of social media and influencers may adversely impact our _reputation”. In addition, we undertake direct advertising and promotional activities, namely the creation of display_ materials for our third-party distributors, catalogues and display materials for trade fairs and exhibitions. Furthermore, modifications to search engine algorithms or their general terms of use could exclude our websites from search results or lower their ranking. Additionally, the costs of these marketing initiatives could increase in the future, particularly as a result of changes in the economic model or media used. From time to time, we will also need to refresh or reinvent our communication strategy, which will require additional expense. There can be no assurance that our advertising and promotional activities will be successful in promoting and maintaining awareness and continued spend on these activities without a resulting increase in revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Certain of our iconic products may be protected by means of copyright law; however, requirements that need to be met to obtain copyright protection of industrial design products (e.g. certain creativity and artistic value thresholds) are quite high and may differ from country to country; therefore, it could be difficult 58 ----- for us to enforce such rights before obtaining a final judicial decision acknowledging that such requirements have been satisfied. In addition, the trademark and design registration procedures and the relevant requirements vary from country to country and, therefore, we cannot guarantee that all of our trademark and registered design applications (especially regarding restyling of classic products) will be granted in each country. Moreover, unlike trademarks, design registrations may be renewed only for a limited period of time, which varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, registered designs in the EU may only be renewed for up to 25 years. In the event of an expired registration, the protection of the shape of the products covered by any expired registrations under copyright and unfair competition laws may be less effective. The degree of protection offered by our various designs, patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us, and our pending applications for designs, patents, copyrights, trademarks or service marks may not be granted. In addition, not all of our products are covered by designs, patents or similar intellectual property protections. For example, Flos has not filed trademarks covering all of its names of products and product lines and relies to a certain extent on de facto_ trademarks. A number of Flos’ classic products could be protected under copyright law; however, as copyrights are not subject to registration formalities under Italian law, enforcing copyright protection is difficult and costly and available remedies are weak. Although Louis Poulsen and Audo follow a policy of registering designs, trademarks and copyrights in their key markets, namely the EU, Norway, the U.S., China, South Korea, Australia the United Kingdom and Japan, in certain jurisdictions it is difficult or impossible to formalize such registrations and as a result enforcement may be challenging. In particular, Louis Poulsen and Audo have not filed trademarks for all of their product names and product lines, relying instead on de facto trademarks. B&B has also not filed or registered trademarks covering the names of all of its products or product lines, and certain other product names and product lines are only covered by _de facto_ trademarks, which requires B&B to prove continuous use on a non-local basis. Although certain of B&B’s well-known designs have been registered, most products covered by B&B’s license agreements with designers have not been registered, and no registrations are in place for products that have been created internally. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of such rights by others, including through the imitation of our products and the misappropriation of our brands or product names. If we are unable to protect or maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished, our financial results may be adversely impacted and our competitive position could suffer. Furthermore, the actions we take to protect our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our licensors may be inadequate to prevent counterfeiting of our products. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. or the member states of the EU. We may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any litigation or other legal proceedings to defend our intellectual property rights and such proceedings may entail a material cost to us, or we may compromise or settle such claims for a variety of reasons. An adverse determination in any dispute involving our intellectual property rights could, among other things, (i) require us to grant licenses to, or obtain licenses from, third parties; (ii) prevent us from manufacturing, selling, importing or promoting our products; (iii) require us to discontinue use of a particular intellectual property right; (iv) subject us to substantial liability; or (v) enable competitors to exploit intangible assets that are currently part of our intellectual property rights. Given the popularity of our products, we believe there is a risk that counterfeit products or other products infringing on our trademarks, designs or licenses will continue to emerge, and this risk tends to be higher on e-commerce platforms. In order to combat counterfeit goods, we have and may continue to be required to expend considerable time and resources on monitoring and protecting our intellectual property rights. Although we have taken steps to detect and prevent further counterfeiting, we may not be able to detect or prevent all instances of infringement and may lose our competitive position in the market before we are able to do so. If the quality of counterfeit products is not representative of the quality of our genuine products, further damage could be done to the reputation of our brands. We may, from time to time, be subject to claims by third parties that products we sell infringe upon their intellectual property rights or violate unfair competition laws and regulations. In addition, while we operate cautiously to avoid infringing any intellectual property rights, we may do so unknowingly. If we are found liable for any such infringement, we could be required to pay substantial damages, destroy products, discontinue the use of certain designs or technologies or comply with injunctions against us to prevent further infringement. In addition, such infringement claims could harm the perception of our brands by our customers or otherwise harm our image or reputation. Any payments we may be required to make and any injunctions with which we may be required to comply as a result of such infringement actions, as well as any failure by us to protect or enforce our 59 ----- intellectual property rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

There can be no assurance that there will not be any strikes in the future, such as in connection with any potential new acquisitions and any associated reorganization efforts. Any work stoppages resulting from employee strikes could hinder our ability to provide our standard level of customer service. In addition, we may become party to labor disputes with certain of our employees, including in connection with termination of their employment relations with us, and from time to time we may carry out collective dismissals. Such collective dismissals may result in disputes with or claims by trade unions and our employees and we may be required to pay additional amounts to resolve or settle such disputes or claims. Any disputes with our employees or work stoppages resulting from strikes or other labor action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. All workers performing their activity in Italian territory are covered by mandatory social security insurance. This system is financed by contributions from employees and employers, calculated as a percentage of the employee’s gross remuneration. These contributions represent a relatively high surcharge on labor costs. Also, in Italy, national insurance contributions to INAIL (the National Institute for Accidents at Work), which covers all professional risks, are mandatory. In addition to these social security measures, employers must set aside in their financial statements (or pay into supplementary pension funds) a mandatory severance payment (Trattamento di _Fine Rapporto or TFR), which is deferred remuneration equal to 1/13.5 of any remuneration paid to the employees_ in connection with the employment relationship. Further changes in any of the above-mentioned laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations could substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The use of the Made in Italy designation is regulated by Italian and EU law and requires that the relevant product be entirely produced in Italy or undergo its “last substantial transformation” in Italy, which has been interpreted to include assembly from semi-finished products manufactured elsewhere. We believe that the Made in Italy designation represents a mark of quality and a differentiator of high value-added products, therefore serving as a competitive advantage for our products carrying the Made in Italy designation as compared to the products of our competitors and across our other collections. If the laws regarding the use of the Made in Italy designation were to become more restrictive in a way that is adverse to our interests, our sales may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The results of pending or future legal proceedings are inherently difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will not incur losses in connection with current or future civil (including in connection with intellectual property and unfair competition matters), administrative or employment suits or other types of judicial, regulatory or administrative proceedings that exceed any provision we have set aside in our financial statements or that exceed any insurance coverage available. As of June 30, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022, we had set aside provisions relating to pending legal proceedings of €2.1 million and €3.3 million, respectively. For more information on existing proceedings, see “Business—Common Factors Across _Flos, B&B, Louis Poulsen_ _and the Emerging Brands—Legal Disputes and Administrative Proceedings”. We may_ also inherit existing litigation or other legal proceedings from the companies that we acquire from time to time. For example, in 2021, Lumens (then doing business as YDesign) was served with a class action complaint from one former employee, acting as named plaintiff on behalf of the plaintiff and any other similarly aggrieved current and former hourly or non-exempt employees of Lumens during the four years prior to the claim, seeking recovery under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 for alleged violations by Lumens of certain provisions of the California Labor Code. These allegations include, among others, failure to pay overtime wages, full meal/rest period premiums, full minimum wage, failure to reimburse necessary business-related expenses and costs as well as unlawful business practices, on account of the foregoing, allegedly resulting in unfair advantage. While Lumens denies the claim, after consultation with its legal counsel, it decided to settle for $910,000 (which 60 ----- includes attorney’s fees and administrative costs over three years) rather than engage in a costly and protracted lawsuit. In addition, even if a legal claim (of any nature) is without merit, does not prevail or is not pursued, any negative publicity surrounding assertions against our business or products could adversely affect our reputation. Regardless of its final outcome, litigation may also result in substantial costs and expenses we would have to incur to defend ourselves, divert the attention of our management or cause an interruption of our normal business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. We are also regularly subject to the examination of our income tax returns and other taxes from the Italian and Danish tax authorities, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the governing tax authorities in other countries where we operate. From time to time, we are involved in discussions or disputes with tax authorities regarding our tax liabilities, which may lead to a revision of our tax liabilities, and therefore affect our financial position. In addition, in recent years, we have responded to audits from the Italian tax authorities on transfer prices relating to intragroup transactions by Flos. Between 2021 and 2023, the Italian tax authority concluded that, in relation to fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017, Flos allegedly committed certain transfer-pricing violations by providing intercompany services to its subsidiaries without obtaining fair compensation for such services and by allowing one of its subsidiaries (Antares) to exploit one of Flos’ trademarks without receiving royalties in connection thereto. Therefore, the Italian tax authority concluded that Flos declared lower profits (in relation to such years) and requested Flos to pay an amount of overall approximately €1.5 million as additional taxes. In 2022, Flos challenged the tax authority’s assessment relating to fiscal year 2015 before the competent first-instance tax court in Italy and intends to defend vigorously against these allegations. Concurrently, Flos initiated a collaborative procedure, currently ongoing, with the Italian tax authority to settle the claim and prevent the Italian authority’s claims from resulting in double taxation. We cannot exclude that the Italian tax authority may allege similar claims in relation to more recent fiscal years. A negative outcome of these tax audits, or any other tax audits and investigations, may generate negative publicity, which could harm our relationships with customers, suppliers and other counterparties. Additionally, if such tax audits, investigations or challenges result in decisions that are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay settlement amounts, fees and penalties, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any such audits, investigations or challenges, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial time and resources to defend ourselves. We routinely assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from any such proceedings to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes.

We are also subject to transfer pricing laws and regulations, including those relating to the flow of funds among our subsidiaries pursuant to, for example, loan agreements. Adverse developments in laws or regulations, or any change in position by the tax authorities regarding the application, administration or interpretation of laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

Some of our agreements with our suppliers and international manufacturers may not indemnify us from product liability for a particular supplier’s or international manufacturer’s products, or our suppliers or international manufacturers may not have sufficient resources or insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, we have been in the past and might be required in the future to replace defective products as part of individual customers’ requests or as part of public recalls, or otherwise intervene to assist customers if one of our products were to be defective, including after several years of use. Although we have not incurred any material losses in connection with these events, we cannot exclude that the occurrence of any such event could adversely affect the perception of our brand in our markets or otherwise result in the incurrence of material expenses. Furthermore, the Group may become subject to actions by regulatory authorities related to alleged failures of products, which may result in fines or costs incurred in connection with product recalls or the defense and resolution of any regulatory enforcement actions.

Such regulations include those governing the manufacture, handling, transport, storage, use, emission, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous wastes and materials, wastewater discharges, noise emissions, human health and safety, process safety and risk management. If we fail to implement safety procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured. Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including current and former owners and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed or released. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have facilities in Italy, Denmark, Spain, USA and Japan, in five of which, specifically located in Novedrate, Bernareggio, Misinto, Caldogno (each in Italy) and Vejen (Denmark), potentially hazardous raw materials, such as foam or paint materials, are used. Any contamination or pollution of the environment surrounding these facilities by these hazardous materials may result in a reporting obligation to the relevant authorities as well as the incurrence of costs for remediation, clean-up or safety procedures and may expose us civil, administrative and criminal liabilities (also pursuant to LD 231/2001). 62 ----- Various current and likely future environmental laws could regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide. We cannot predict the impact that such regulation may have, or that climate change may otherwise have, on our business. Many of our operations require permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities and are frequently issued subject to conditions requiring the implementation of improvement works at the relevant sites. Typically, our permits require ongoing compliance with certain conditions in order to maintain the applicable permit. Our permits may include requirements and conditions which have not yet been finally determined, and which could result in significant additional costs or environmental obligations for us. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, ongoing capital and operating expenditures to ensure compliance with current and future EHS laws and regulations. In addition, our facilities are subject to building permits, zoning town planning and similar laws and regulations (including restrictions to the use and sale of sites set by the authority entrusted with the protection of cultural and architectonic assets) providing for civil, administrative and criminal responsibilities in case of non-compliance. Moreover, our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the applicable regulations. If we were to violate the applicable regulations, we could be fined, and the competent regulator could impose a complete shutdown of the non-compliant manufacturing facility. Failure to comply with EHS laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties, the imposition of other civil or criminal sanctions (also pursuant to LD 231/2001), liabilities under health and safety laws and regulations, remediation or restoration requirements, claims for personal injury or property damages, the installation of costly pollution control equipment, or restrictions on, or the suspension of, our operating permits or activities. We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Our safety record is critical to our reputation. If any health and safety accident occurred, this may result in liabilities and a negative impact on worker motivation and our reputation or the operations of the affected facility. New technology, the implementation of new work processes, services, tools and machinery may have unforeseen negative effects on the working conditions of our employees and may subject us to liabilities based on allegations of illness or disease resulting from exposure. Violations of, or liabilities under, applicable environmental or occupational health and safety laws and regulations, also as a result of inadequacy and gaps in our EHS organizational structure, may result in fines, penalties, legal claims, sanctions (including operational bans) as well as increased operating costs, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we were found negligent, or our insurance were insufficient in scope and amount, we could be liable for the corresponding shortfall or lack of coverage. Under applicable Italian law, when workers become injured in connection with their duties and as a result are absent from work for more than 40 days, the relevant public prosecutor must open an investigation into workplace safety and, depending on the circumstances, may bring criminal proceedings against our officer charged with workplace safety or against our management or chief executive officer. Although we believe that EHS laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that future events, such as new or more stringent EHS laws, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions or workplace accidents, would not require us to incur substantial additional costs to ensure our continued regulatory compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

However, our insurance coverage is subject to common exclusions, limits and deductibles. Given the multifaceted nature of the locations and working environments in which our employees provide services, alongside the range of our operational scope, we are not able to foresee accurately all relevant activities and situations in order to ensure that they are fully covered by the terms of our insurance policies. As a result, we may incur losses or be subject to claims that exceed the type, scope or amount of our limit of liability or fall outside terms and conditions agreed. At the same time, we have identified several risks that cannot be insured on economically feasible terms and for which, therefore, we have chosen not to purchase insurance cover. On July 25, 2023, the extraordinary weather events that affected the Monza Brianza area in northern Italy caused the breakage of skylights in our facilities located in Misinto, Italy (in use by B&B Italia and DQM). In addition to damage to the buildings, we suffered damage to some of the raw materials and semi-finished products stored in the facilities. As a result, the operations of B&B Italia were interrupted, while operations of DQM resumed shortly after the weather events. B&B Italia’s facility is currently operating at reduced capacity and is expected to restore full capacity in November 2023. Although we do not expect these extraordinary events to have had a 63 ----- material adverse effect on the operations of B&B Italia and DQM, we are continuing to evaluate with the assistance of an expert appointed by B&B and DQM the final amount of losses caused by the business interruption of B&B Italia’s operations as well as by the damage to the raw materials, semi-finished products and building. We filed an initial insurance claim for coverage of the damage, and documentation to support the insurance claim is in the process of being collected. While we will seek an advanced payment on the insurance indemnification in the fourth quarter of this year, as provided by the insurance policy, and the rest as soon as possible thereafter, we cannot guarantee that we will obtain the full claim payout or within the foregoing timeline. In addition, the insurance payout is subject to typical deductibles and maximum coverage amounts in accordance with the damage. If one or more claims exceed, in the aggregate, a certain amount in a given calendar year, insurers may increase the insurance premiums, or the terms and conditions of our insurance coverage may become less favorable than at present. Our insurance costs may also increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. There is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, recent turmoil and volatility in the global financial markets may adversely affect the insurance market. This may result in some of the insurers in our insurance portfolio failing and being unable to pay their share of claims as well as in an increase in the insurance costs.

The amount of our provision for doubtful debts is based on our assessment of historical collection trends, business and economic conditions and other collection indicators. However, there can be no assurance that bad debts associated with delinquent payment or non-payment by our customers will not increase, also due to challenging global economic conditions. Furthermore, in the event that these customers are unable to timely pay the amounts due to us, we may need to implement certain specific debt management plans which, while allowing our customers to continue their operations, may entail a reduction or deferral of the payments due to us. If the macroeconomic conditions in our core markets deteriorate, we cannot assure you that we will not have to increase our provisions for doubtful debts relating to trade receivables, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €1,042.6 million, including €425.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, €470.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Floating Rate Notes, and €28.7 million of drawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, in the event that freely available cash on our balance sheet on or about the Issue Date is lower than our estimate, we may draw down additional amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date or shortly thereafter. We anticipate that we will continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future, including as a result of the Revolving Credit Facility Upsize, which subject to satisfaction of certain conditions specified therein, will result in an upsize of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from €100.0 million to €140.0 million. See “Capitalization”, “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Notes”. Our high leverage could have important consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt and liabilities we may incur; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payments in respect of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, or other general corporate purposes; - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and/or the industry in which we operate; - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors; - increasing our exposure to interest rate increases to the extent that our indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future borrowings. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes.

The Issuer is, and will continue to be following the Transactions, dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends, principal repayments or interest payments under the Intercompany Loans or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes, as we do not intend to merge the Issuer and any of its subsidiaries. Given the Group’s international operations, the Group has a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or otherwise transfer funds directly or indirectly to the Issuer. The Issuer’s subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash to the Issuer. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation in the form of withholding tax or other taxes pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction of the relevant subsidiary and/or Italy, which is the jurisdiction of the Issuer. Applicable laws may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay its debt when due. In addition, the aggregate amount of the Intercompany Loans is, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, €371.4 million (equivalent), which amounts in aggregate are significantly lower than the aggregate principal amounts of the Notes and the Existing Notes, and we expect the Intercompany Loans to yield interest broadly in line with the interest accruing under the Notes or the Existing Floating Rate Notes, as applicable. Accordingly, the ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes will largely depend on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Issuer, which will be subject to the risks described above and could be inefficient from a tax perspective. The subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees.

Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”.

The Existing Floating Rate Notes bear a variable rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), plus an applicable margin, and the Revolving Credit Facility bears a variable rate based on the EURIBOR (and, if applicable, CIBOR, NIBOR or STIBOR), plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Indenture, the Existing Indenture nor the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.

As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, only the synthetic 1-month, 3-month and 6-month US dollar LIBOR settings, and the synthetic 3-month sterling LIBOR setting, remain, with the USD settings expected to cease permanently at the end of September 2024 and the sterling setting expected to cease permanently at the end of March 2024. The cessation of the remaining LIBOR settings will result in the rate of interest in respect of LIBOR-linked borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility being determined as set out in the facility documentation, which may result in such borrowings being subject to a rate of interest that is materially different from that which would have produced by LIBOR over an equivalent period. This could have an adverse impact on our ability to service our debt. We anticipate managing this difference and any resulting increased variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/or derivative instruments, however future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and we may incur significant associated costs.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Notes Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor or security provider will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant guarantor or the security provider, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate interest or benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance, voidable preferences, thin capitalization or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Notes Guarantee and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Notes Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Notes Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant guarantor or security provider, or such Notes Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, financial assistance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Notes Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Notes Guarantee will dilute the value of such Notes Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes. Accordingly, enforcement of any such Notes Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Notes Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant guarantors. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its Notes Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it. It is possible that a Guarantor or creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee or judicial liquidation receiver in the case of a bankruptcy, insolvency and/or judicial liquidation (as applicable) of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee on any of the above grounds and the applicable court may determine that the Notes Guarantee should be limited, subordinated or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the Notes Guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would to that extent be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor.

These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulation or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.

For more information, see “Certain Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. Italian law limitations_ As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Existing Indenture, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, each Notes Guarantee and security interest granted by each of Flos and B&B (the “Italian Guarantors”) will be limited as follows: (i) the Notes Guarantee and security interests to be granted by each of the Italian Guarantors will only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under the relevant Tranche of the Notes and shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including (i) with respect to Flos, the Flos I/C Loan, and (ii) with respect to B&B, the B&B I/C Loan) advanced from time to time to the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following November 22, 2018, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or of security granted by the Italian Guarantors, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or _surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Notes_ Guarantee; (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Flos, also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes; (iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by B&B, also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the original principal amount of the Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of 73 ----- the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the original principal amount of the Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes; (iv) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the relevant Italian Guarantor at that time; (v) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations of any of the Italian Guarantors under its Notes Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively; and (vi) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest by: (a) Flos does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment obligations under Tranche B (each as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes; and (b) B&B does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment obligations under Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes. The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” and/or refinancing indebtedness in relation to “acquisition debt” in respect of, respectively, Flos and B&B and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to refinance the portion of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes that was utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of, respectively, Flos and B&B. Should the Notes Guarantees and/or the security interests granted by Flos and/or B&B, respectively, be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Notes Guarantees and/or security interests, could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Notes Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to the relevant Italian Guarantor, such Italian Guarantor will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Notes Guarantee shall not be in force and effect. In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than Design Holding, Flos and B&B) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indenture and/ or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further _pari passu_ indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and _vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Notes, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any agreement 74 ----- regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees and security granted by such Italian Guarantors. See “Certain _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void. _Danish law limitations_ Consolidated Act No. 1168 of September 1, 2023 on companies (selskabsloven), as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Danish Companies Act”) contains restrictions on upstream guarantees and security by Danish limited companies. Generally, Danish companies and their Danish and non-Danish subsidiaries are prohibited from granting loans to and/or issuing guarantees or providing security in respect of obligations of, among others, their direct and indirect parent companies. However, Danish companies may grant loans to and/or issue guarantees or provide security in respect of obligations of parent companies covered by Danish Executive Order No. 85 of January 30, 2020, which applies to any entity in the corporate form of (a) a public limited company (aktieselskab), (b) a limited partnership company _(partnerselskab), (c) a private limited liability company (anpartsselskab) or (d) a company with an equivalent corporate form, incorporated in a jurisdiction which is a member of the EU (such as the Issuer, which is a joint stock company incorporated in Italy) or European Economic Area or Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Chile, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan or the U.S. In addition, a Danish company is generally prohibited from granting loans and/or issue guarantees and/or provide security in connection with the financing (or refinancing) of the acquisition by any person or entity of shares in such Danish company or shares in its (direct and indirect) parent companies, and any such loan, guarantee or security will be invalid and unenforceable. Further, Danish law requires guarantors or security providers to obtain an adequate corporate benefit from the issuance of a guarantee or granting of security. The directors or, as the case may be, the managers of the company are obliged to act in accordance with the company’s individual interests, including by, among other things, taking into consideration the company’s financial position, the benefits the company will obtain through and the risks related to the granting of guarantees and security, assessment of the Issuer and the other Guarantors and security providers, and by ensuring that the relevant guarantee or security arrangement is on market terms. If such benefit is not obtained, the directors or, as the case may be, the managers of a Danish guarantor or security provider may be subject to civil liability and the guarantee and/or security may be deemed invalid. It is not clear under Danish case law under which circumstances corporate benefit accrues to a subsidiary guaranteeing and securing debt of a direct or indirect parent company or other group company. Given the aforementioned limitations under Danish law with respect to Danish financial assistance and corporate benefit, and with a view to minimizing the risk of being challenged or set aside, the Notes Guarantees and security to be granted by a Danish Guarantor or security provider: (i) will not apply to any part of the Notes being used to refinance the portion of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes that was used to finance the acquisition of Danish HoldCo by the Issuer, (ii) (other than Danish HoldCo) will not apply to any part of the Notes being used to refinance the portion of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes that was used to refinance the DKK 750 million (€100.5 million) senior creditor facilities that were incurred by Luminous Designs Denmark ApS to finance the acquisition of LP in August 2018 (the “LP Senior Facilities”) (as further described below), in order for such Notes Guarantees and security to comply with Danish statutory provisions on unlawful financial assistance; and (iii) shall in respect of upstream (and, if applicable, cross-stream) guarantees not exceed, among other things, a maximum equivalent to 75 ----- the greater of the equity _(egenkapital) of the relevant Danish Guarantor or security provider (calculated in accordance with the approved accounting principles) (1) at the time of the granting of the Notes Guarantees or Collateral, as applicable or (2) at the time payment is requested pursuant to the Notes Guarantees or Collateral is enforced, as applicable, in order for such Notes Guarantees and security to comply with the above corporate benefit concerns. The aforementioned limitations and respective compliance with Danish financial assistance and corporate benefit rules are untested in Danish courts. Accordingly, if a Notes Guarantee or security provided by a Danish company were to be challenged before a Danish court, we cannot assure that such court will deem the Notes Guarantee or security valid and enforceable. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees _and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ In August 2018, Luminous Designs Denmark ApS incurred the LP Senior Facilities to finance the acquisition of LP. On April 6, 2021, Luminous Designs Denmark ApS was dissolved by merging into Danish HoldCo, the surviving entity, which assumed all of Luminous Designs Denmark ApS’ assets and liabilities, including the acquisition debt from the LP Senior Facilities, in accordance with Danish law’s principle of universal succession. Consequently, the portion of the proceeds of the Notes which will be used to refinance the portion of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes the proceeds of which were used to refinance the LP Senior Facilities in 2018 (which was also partially refinanced by other secured senior notes of the Issuer, which in turn were refinanced in 2021 with proceeds from a portion of the Existing Floating Rate Notes) will constitute unlawful financial assistance debt and LP and its subsidiaries will not be able to guarantee or provide security for such debt. If such unlawful financial assistance debt cannot be separated from other debt, such other debt may also be deemed unlawful assistance debt and other loans, guarantees or security granted by Danish companies for such debt may then be invalid or unenforceable. Thus, LP and its subsidiaries will not be able to guarantee or provide security for debts constituting unlawful financial assistance debt (i.e., the proceeds from the offering of the Notes which will be used to refinance a portion of the Existing Fixed Rated Notes the proceeds of which were used to refinance the LP Senior Facilities). Given that the Danish Companies Act does not include any detailed provision on the segregation of acquisition debt from other debt for the purpose of determining whether financial assistance has in fact been provided, the beneficiary, upon enforcement, may be required to evidence that enforcement proceeds are in fact applied in accordance with the Danish restrictions on financial assistance. Furthermore, according to the Danish Business Authority, the prohibition on financial assistance also extends to non-Danish subsidiaries of Danish companies. If loans, guarantees or security are granted in violation of the prohibitions above, such loans, guarantees or security will be invalid and unenforceable and must be repaid with statutory interests. The directors may be subject to liability for losses suffered in this regard. _Spanish law limitations_ As a result of the applicable limitations under Spanish law with respect to, amongst others, financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, each Notes Guarantee, Collateral and security interest granted by Antares or any Spanish company will not guarantee those obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish Companies Act. In particular, Antares will not guarantee the acquisition of, or the subscription for the shares or quota shares of, its parent company (sociedad dominante); however, it will be allowed (provided it continues being a public limited liability company (sociedad anónima)) to guarantee the acquisition of, or the subscription for the shares or quota shares of any other company (different from its parent company (sociedad dominante)) belonging to its group and any other not of its group. For the purposes of Antares as a Guarantor of the Notes, the Indenture will include the above-mentioned limitations regarding financial assistance. In addition, under Spanish law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, guarantee or security interests follow the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security. In the event that the security providers incorporated in Spain are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or in respect of the relevant security provided are not enforceable. Additionally, pursuant to Spanish applicable legislation: 76 ----- - The concept of a first demand guarantee is not specifically regulated in the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil) but it has been treated under Spanish case law as an autonomous guarantee detached from the underlying agreement whose obligations are being guaranteed. Therefore, Spanish case law acknowledges the validity of the provision pursuant to which the guarantor has agreed not to call on exceptions different from those arising from the guarantee. Nevertheless, Spanish case law has also admitted the possibility that, with certain limitations, the guarantor invokes against the beneficiary of the guarantee the exception of fraud, bad faith or abuse of right in the events where the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a fraudulent manner or with bad faith. - The laws of Spain may limit the ability of any Spanish guarantor to guarantee debt of a related company or grant security on account of a related company’s debts. These limitations arise from the interpretations of various provisions and from certain general principles of corporate law which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee or the granting of security to guarantee or secure a parent or sister company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective. If these limitations were not observed, the guarantees or security granted by any Spanish guarantor could be subject to legal challenge. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations”. Other limitations pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency laws_ Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of that Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or the creditor was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when the relevant Notes Guarantee was granted; - the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee or the relevant Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the relevant Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. It is possible that a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or a creditor of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee or grantor’s creation of security on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Notes Guarantee or the relevant security interest should be limited or voided. To the extent such limitations on the Notes Guarantee or security obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or grantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor or grantor to the extent of such limitations. Future pledges or guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest. 77 ----- Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and _the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ As a general rule under Danish law, the insolvent company or any creditor of such company may present a petition for bankruptcy. A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied that the debtor is insolvent and that the insolvency is not temporary based on an assessment of the debtor’s liquidity status. A bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the vent of the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security. The Danish bankruptcy scheme is based on the fundamental principle of pari passu satisfaction of the debtor’s creditors. The principle is, however, to some extent modified by the rules governing priority of debts in bankruptcy. The ranking of creditors is described in the Consolidated Act No. 11 of January 6, 2014 on bankruptcy (konkursloven), as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Danish Bankruptcy Act”), and it indicates the order in which claims against the estate or the debtor are settled. After the fulfilment, if any, of these priority-ranking claims, any exceeds proceeds will be distributed among all ordinary unsecured creditors. Interest accrued on ordinary claims will rank as ordinary claims up the declaration of bankruptcy, after which date the accrued interest will rank as a deferred claim. Deferred claims further include, among others, subordinated loans and penalties. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the _Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ With respect to Spanish Law, the Spanish Insolvency Law (as defined herein) imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s rights (in rem security) with security over rights or assets which are considered as necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s professional or business activities in the event of insolvency, with certain exceptions (such as financial collateral, as defined under Royal Decree Law 5/2005, of March 11, as amended from time to time). The moratorium would take effect following the declaration of insolvency until the earlier of (i) the elapsing of one year from the declaration of the insolvency without the liquidation phase being initiated or (ii) approval of a creditors’ composition agreement (convenio de acreedores). Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of the declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. The stay will only be lifted when the court hearing the insolvency proceedings determines that the asset is not necessary for the continuance of the debtor’s professional or business activities. When it comes to determining which assets of the debtor are necessary for the continuance of its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets. Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted over such shares/quota shares does not bring about an early termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic exploitation of the relevant asset.

The Indenture also permits the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor 78 ----- Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. See “Description of Certain Financing Agreements—Intercreditor Agreement”. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so in accordance with the provisions described in the following paragraphs. If either (i) the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or Existing Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

See “Description of Notes—Security”. Not all of our assets will secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred with certain property and assets that do not secure the Notes. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. As of June 30, 2023, the Issuer and its subsidiaries had no indebtedness secured by assets that will not secure the Notes. While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional Notes Guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of granting liens in favor of other indebtedness or the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles. The Agreed Security Principles set forth in the Indenture set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or Notes Guarantee in certain circumstances. The operation of such Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, such Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the security or Notes Guarantee provided by the Issuer and any Guarantor. In particular, even though the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to share the same Collateral and Guarantees, this may not always continue to be the case and circumstances may arise in the future in which lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application of the Agreed Security Principles and, ultimately, Italian, Danish and Spanish financial assistance and corporate benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances holders of the Notes would have no direct claim for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party with respect to any such additional collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the 80 ----- _value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and other secured indebtedness may be secured by assets that do not secure the Notes”._ If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Notes. In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. The Collateral provided as security for the Notes, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be limited to liens granted over certain assets including the shares of the Issuer and the relevant subsidiaries, certain intercompany structural loans within the Group and certain material bank accounts of the Issuer. See “Description of Notes—Security”. Trade receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property or other assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. The value of the assets underlying the pledges and the amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of the Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in such entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and any Guarantor’s remaining assets. The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens on the Collateral other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties are secured by liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to such assets which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The granting of the Notes Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.","The granting of the Notes Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening, clawback, voidance or preference periods for such Notes Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions, including Italy, Denmark, Spain and the United States. The granting of shared security interests, including in connection 81 ----- with any release and retake of such security interest, to secure existing, new or future indebtedness (such as hedging obligations or any additional notes issued under the Indenture) or the transfer or the assignment of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening, clawback or preference periods in certain jurisdictions, including Italy, Denmark, Spain and the United States. The applicable hardening, clawback, voidance or preference period for these new security interests (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Collateral granted to secure the Notes) can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected, amended, confirmed and/or confirmed and extended, shared or recreated (as applicable). At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated or confirmed and/or extended were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void, ineffective, clawed back and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Under Italian law, Danish law, Spanish law and U.S. law, in case any security interests (including security interests in the Collateral) are released and retaken at any time, such release and retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a new hardening or preference period in respect of such security interests. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, bankruptcy trustees, insolvency administrators or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such security interests. See “Certain Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ The Indenture will provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in several circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock or other common equity interest and certain internal “permitted reorganizations”. In Italy, Denmark, Spain and the United States, for example, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to new hardening or preference periods in respect of the relevant security interests in the Collateral that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and the security interests in the relevant Collateral would be subject to the same risks described in the preceding paragraph. The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, because the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the security interests in the Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions, respective realization and enforcement may be further delayed by court proceedings being taken in multiple jurisdictions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

As the Notes will be issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In addition, the Indenture does not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge.

In the event of bankruptcy, judicial liquidation, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in either of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees 82 ----- and the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and any Guarantor that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia (collectively, the “United States”) may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes Guarantee and the security documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations”._ Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on such Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including Italian, Danish and Spanish and U.S. law, as applicable. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including the Republic of Italy and Spain). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy and Spain, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable provided Italian and Spanish case law has not ruled for its application. All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations (except for cases such as Spain where the Principal Obligations would be secured). Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, Danish law and Spanish law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement 83 ----- of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes _Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ For example, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which may be granted after the Offering. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and _the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ In Spain, the concept of “parallel debt” is not recognized under Spanish law and guarantees/ security interests require the beneficiary of the guarantee/ security interests and the creditor to be the same person, thus implying that any guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third party who does not hold the guaranteed/secured claim but purports to hold guarantees/security interests for the parties that do. In particular, in Spain, the Collateral will be granted directly to the holders of the Notes represented and acting through the Security Agent which also acts in its capacity as representative (en nombre y representación) of the holders of the Notes and thus being the only party entitled to enforce the guarantees or security interests granted in respect to the obligations derived from the Notes. For the enforcement of any security interest in Spain by the Security Agent, it will be necessary (i) that each of the secured parties benefiting from such Collateral proves its title to the secured obligations, ratifies such Collateral and accepts the benefit of the security interest in its respective name and (ii) to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered by means of duly notarized powers of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the actual or future creditors, if necessary, with the Apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961. Therefore, there could be a delay in the enforcement of the Collateral in Spain while the Security Agent obtains such powers and the relevant public deeds are granted. In the absence of the notarized and apostilled powers of attorney, the Security Agent may not be able to enforce the relevant Collateral or security interests in Spain on behalf of the holders of the Notes, and there is a risk that the Security Agent would only be able to enforce the security interest against the debt that it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it may be acting as Security Agent. Further, those beneficial holders of the security who have not accepted the security or have not duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the Security Agent to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law perspective including without limitation in an insolvency scenario, as unsecured creditors. Further, there is a risk that the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced might request both the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise, and the notarization of each and every one of the transfer certificates regarding each and every transfer of the Notes. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability _of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ The enforcement of the Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law, located in Denmark or governed by Danish law and located in Spain or governed by Spanish law is subject to mandatory provisions of Italian law, Danish law and Spanish law, as applicable, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements. As regards the security documents governed by Danish law, the Security Agent’s ability to hold the relevant security interests on behalf of the holders of the Notes require that the Security Agent is registered with the Danish 84 ----- Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet) in accordance with the rules set out in Chapter 4 of the Consolidated Act No. 41 of January 13, 2023 on capital markets (kapitalmarkedsloven), as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Danish Capital Markets Act”). No assurance can be given that the Security Agent or the terms and conditions of the Notes and other documents meet the eligibility criteria for the Security Agent to be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, that such registration will be obtained or, if obtained, that it will be maintained.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest, the holder of the security interest having difficulty enforcing such holder’s right in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and/or judicial liquidation (as applicable) and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive proceeds from any enforcement of the Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations”._ As a matter of Danish law, it is, inter alia, a perfection requirement that bank accounts and the cash flow from assigned intercompany loans are controlled by the Security Agent (i.e. by effectively blocking the pledgor from making any withdrawal from the bank account without the specific consent of the Security Agent and by only allowing payment of the intercompany loan to the Security Agent (or a third party so designated by the Security Agent)). Absent such perfection, the holder of the security interest will be unable to enforce its rights in the secured assets in competition with third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same assets. Furthermore, if the Security Agent gains control of the cash flow at a later stage, the security interest in such assets will be subject to the voidance rules of the Danish Bankruptcy Act, which among other things, include a general three-month hardening period from the day the Security Agent assumes control of the cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of 85 ----- the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be, including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum requirements relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and to change the amendment provisions.

Considering the sweeping nature of this reform and the absence of judicial guidance, the impact cannot be predicted or fully assessed as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. For a 86 ----- description of Italian insolvency laws and regulations, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of _the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are largely untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). Danish HoldCo and Louis Poulsen are companies incorporated under the laws of Denmark. Accordingly, any insolvency proceedings with respect to Danish HoldCo and its Danish subsidiaries may proceed under, and be governed by, the insolvency laws of Denmark. These laws may adversely affect the enforcement of your rights under the Notes and may not be as favorable to your interests as a creditor as the laws of other jurisdictions. In a Danish bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors based on a priority of claims. Such liquidation may not yield the same value to the creditors as a reorganization and sale of a going concern. As a general rule, the debtor or any creditor may present a petition for bankruptcy. A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied that the debtor is insolvent based on a statement of the debtor’s liquidity status. A bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the event of the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security. If bankruptcy proceedings are commenced, payments under the Notes may be delayed and may not be made in full. Provisions on avoidance and set off may adversely affect the enforcement of rights under the Notes. Danish insolvency law also includes a scheme for reconstruction (rekonstruktion) of insolvent companies. In broad terms, this scheme provides for reconstruction of an insolvent company by achieving one of the following statutory objectives: (i) a transfer of the business in full or in part; (ii) a compulsory composition/moratorium; (iii) a combination of a compulsory composition/moratorium with the transfer of the business; (iv) other measures, including, but not limited to, capital injection, debt conversion, and a capital reduction followed by a subsequent capital increase; or (v) other measures combined with a compulsory composition/moratorium and/or transfer of business. In general, the provisions on avoidance and set off applicable in a bankruptcy also applies when reconstruction proceedings are commenced. In addition, Antares is incorporated under the laws of Spain and, accordingly, any insolvency proceedings with respect to it may proceed under, and be governed by, the laws of Spain. The insolvency laws of Spain may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as the laws of the United States or some other jurisdictions, and certain provisions of Spanish Insolvency Law could affect the ranking of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees or claims relating to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees (including enforcement claims) on an insolvency of Antares, as the case may be. As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Notes Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may also void the security interest or the Notes Guarantees if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Notes Guarantees and the security interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the security interests provided by such security provider; 87 ----- - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee or any security interest on the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Notes Guarantee or security interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Notes Guarantee or the security interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or security interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial _assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral”._ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Notes Guarantees were issued or the security interests created, the Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Notes Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others (and, in certain jurisdictions, even if the recipient was aware that the Guarantor or the collateral provider was insolvent when it granted the Notes Guarantee or security interest), or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Notes Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Notes Guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Notes Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Notes Guarantee or security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes Guarantee or the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due; - the Notes Guarantee or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening date of insolvency proceedings of the Guarantor or collateral provider; or - the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Notes Guarantee or created any security interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that we and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security 88 ----- provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Notes Guarantees were issued or the security interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued or the security interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer or the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the guarantee and/or the security interests granted to guarantee or secure (as applicable) the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors or by operation of law under the rules of avoidance or clawback (revocatoria) of Italian Bankruptcy Law (to the extent applicable), the Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect _period”). See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information._ If challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with the security may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any guarantee or security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the guarantee or of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Under Spanish law the granting of security is subject to the two-year applicable clawback regime in the case of an insolvency. Therefore, the insolvency trustee or receiver could challenge those transactions that could be deemed as being “detrimental” (perjudiciales) to the insolvent debtor’s estate, provided that they have taken place within two years prior to bankruptcy declaration, even in the absence of fraudulent intent (in accordance with Article 238 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, transactions taking place four years before the insolvency declaration are subject to the ordinary regime of rescission set forth in the Spanish Civil Code). In order to seek protection against claw-back, refinancing agreements (out-of-court workouts) may be judicially sanctioned (homologados) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct an eventual insolvency proceeding in compliance with the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law.

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below), any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to the judicial winding-up declaration are ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced Article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code, according to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw-back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations —Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations—Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code sets_ forth that claims of entities exercising management and coordination powers vis-à-vis the entities subject to such powers, and claims of the entities subject to such powers vis-à-vis the entities exercising them, deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial winding up in the year before, are subordinated. 89 ----- The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions relating to Article 467 of the Italian Civil Code summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as joint stock company (società per azioni), hence potentially to the Italian borrowers under the relevant Intercompany Loans (i.e. Flos and B&B). Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such of the Italian Civil Code in respect of the Flos I/C Loan and/or the B&B I/C Loan borrowed by, respectively, Flos and B&B. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that Flos’ and/or B&B’s obligations under, respectively, the Flos I/C Loan and the B&B I/C Loan are subordinated to all their obligations to other creditors. Should any of Flos’ and/or B&B’s obligations under, respectively, the Flos I/C Loan and the B&B I/C Loan be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under, respectively, the Flos I/C Loan and the B&B I/C Loan to the relevant subsidiary, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes _Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including the Guarantees provided by B&B and Flos) may be impaired or restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Interests in the Global Notes (as defined below) will trade in book entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below), will be issued in exchange for book entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. 90 ----- Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors own book entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has from time to time been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes and may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.

Excess interest income may be carried forward without time limitation to allow deduction of interest expenses in following years. A further deduction of interest expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of the EBITDA of a company, modified with certain adjustments (risultato operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica) (“ROL”), as well as 30% of ROL carried forward from previous fiscal years. The ROL is calculated on the basis of the value of the items of the Issuer’s profit and loss account, which are comprised of the operating gross revenues and expenses (excluding depreciation of tangible and intangible assets, as well as leasing fees), as determined through the application of the tax rules concerning the determination of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expense in a fiscal year can be carried forward for the following five fiscal years. Net interest expense not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years without time limits, provided that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income of the same fiscal year and interest income carried forward from the previous years, is lower than 30% of ROL. If the tax group regime (consolidato fiscale) applies, interest expense not deducted by an entity in the Italian tax group due to lack of ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit of the excess of interest income of the same fiscal year and interest income carried forward from the previous years (if accrued after the inclusion in the Italian tax group) and the excess of ROL of the same fiscal year and ROL carried forward of the previous five years (if accrued after the inclusion in the Italian tax group) of the other Italian resident companies belonging to the same tax group. Our ability to deduct interest expense in respect of the Notes and other indebtedness incurred by companies within the Group will therefore depend on the ROL and our ability to have tax group arrangements. Any delay in the effectiveness of a tax group will impact the ability to deduct interest expense. In addition, there can be no assurance that in case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would not try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the component of any financing used, in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan, when the terms and conditions of the refinancing transaction appear less favorable than the ones of the previous financing transaction or to finance payments or distributions of dividends and/or capital made to shareholders of the Issuer or otherwise. In particular, in such circumstances the relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing do not relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the relevant transaction is deemed as “anti-economic” and as such not compliant with the “business purpose” (inerenza) principle set out under Italian tax law). The Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged leveraged buyout (“LBO”) transactions with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. On March 30, 93 ----- 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter n. 6/E (the “Circular Letter”) clarifying, as a common principle, that interest on the acquisition bank loan in LBO transactions is generally deductible for IRES purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in art. 96 Presidential Decree n.917 of December 22, 1986. In particular, the Italian Revenue Agency confirmed that LBO transactions are grounded on sound economic reasons, as the aim to acquire control over the target company and its structure (including the debt push down) is usually requested by third-party lenders. As a result of such guidance, LBO transactions are generally not considered suspect for tax purposes absent specific circumstances in which the tax authorities contend that the structuring of any such transaction was designed to obtain unlawful tax advantages in violation of the law or established legal principles (e.g. re-leveraged transactions without a change of control). Any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation, including any future limitation on the use of the ROL or the tax treatment of interest expense arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements relating to the deductibility of interest expense or the application by Italian tax authorities of certain existing interpretations of Italian tax law (including as referred to in the Circular Letter) may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expense and application of withholding taxes, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition. Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of the transactions performed or of our previous or existing indebtedness, including the Notes or the use of proceeds from the Offering, including on the basis of anti-avoidance or anti-abusive criteria, we may be unable to fully deduct our interest expenses or be subject to (i) significant penalties and accrued interest, (ii) the imposition of withholding taxes or (iii) other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of the Group,17.4.1,General Economic and Industry Conditions,"Our business is dependent on the demand for high-end furniture and lighting products, especially in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, which make up a significant portion of our revenue. Demand for our products is in part affected by general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns, which generally depend on economic growth in the countries in which we operate. Notwithstanding general market conditions worldwide, we have historically been able to achieve strong cash flow generation supported by our high profitability levels and limited capital expenditure requirements. Our Free Cash Flow (calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period minus Maintenance Capital Expenditure for such period) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was €208.0 million, €206.6 million, €175.0 million and €133.2 million, resulting in a very high Free Cash Flow Conversion (calculated as the ratio of Free Cash Flow for the relevant period to Adjusted EBITDA for such period) for each such period of 95.2%, 94.7%, 91.8% and 93.0%, respectively. 101 ----- Following the sharp downturn in 2020 resulting from the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic which affected our operations particularly in the first part that year, an improvement in global economic conditions in 2021 and 2022 positively influenced our results of operations for such periods with our revenues from contracts with customers growing across our platform, geographies and brands. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the outlook for the global economy, however, remains uncertain, in part due to the highly inflationary environment that has been adversely affecting the major global economies since early 2022, and certain markets, including Europe, may not achieve the growth rates that were forecasted. Such uncertainty has been recently exacerbated by the frictions between China and the United States, continued hostilities in the Middle East, including the currently unpredictable consequences of the conflict between Israel and Hamas and the long-lasting tensions in North Africa and Eastern Europe, as well as the global turmoil resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in severe political, social and economic consequences in the countries directly involved in the conflict and more broadly on the European continent. While we have not experienced any significant supply chain disruptions or delays in shipping products to our customers or receiving input from suppliers, the ongoing war in Ukraine has been a driver behind a significant surge in energy and other commodity prices and transportation costs in 2022 globally, which has been, and may continue to be, a key factor in driving inflationary pressure and may ultimately adversely affect general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending power as well as our results of operations. The direct impact of the war on our results in terms of revenue has been limited, as we generated less than 2% of our revenue from sales in Russia and Ukraine for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amount of outstanding orders from customers in Russia and Ukraine amounted to €3.9 million as of June 30, 2023, compared to €4.4 million as of December 31, 2022 (with most of the sales being guaranteed by advance payments). In addition, we do not source any strategic supply from those regions and do not operate any DOS in the affected areas. Notwithstanding, the geopolitical situation and the associated inflationary environment that has affected most of the major world economies since early 2022 have contributed in part to the increase in our transport and custom expenses, and utilities, maintenance and IT expenses, from €19.9 million and €11.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021, to €44.3 million and €21.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Over the periods under review, our market positioning, brand recognition and the quality of our products have allowed us to mitigate such increases by passing the vast majority of such higher costs on to our customers. However, there can be no assurance that continued or renewed geopolitical tensions will not impact the spending power of our customers and in turn their willingness or ability to accept any such price increase. High levels of inflation or sovereign debt, combined with weak growth and high unemployment, could affect the spending capacity of our customers leading to weaker demand and an increase in the risk of bad debts and increased counterparty credit risk. While we have not experienced any material delays in payments by customers over the periods under review, and our allowance for bad and doubtful debt as a percentage of our total receivables from third parties as of June 30, 2023 remained substantially stable compared to December 31, 2022, our products may be perceived as luxuries not essential for daily life and customers may reduce their purchases of these products before other essentials or opt for cheaper products if they need to reduce their spending. The Nordics, for example, were particularly affected by the adverse macroeconomic environment over the past year, and our revenues in the region decreased by 34.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The continued changes in general economic conditions and, most recently, the impact of the adverse global, European and Italian economic and market conditions, including, among others, the current and lingering effects of geopolitical tensions, ongoing conflicts and inflationary environment, are likely to impact the levels of spending by consumers and businesses on discretionary products, such as high-end furniture and lighting products. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are affected by general economic conditions _worldwide, and unfavorable economic conditions could result in a decline in the demand for our products and a_ material adverse effect on our financial performance”._ According to the Industry Report, the Core High-End Design market in which we operate has grown steadily over the past few years at CAGRs of 5% and 7% per annum between 2014 and 2019 and between 2019 and 2022, respectively, being valued approximately €47 billion by retail value in 2022. We currently estimate (based on provisional data available to us) that following a slowdown in 2023 on the back of temporary headwinds which are not expected to affect the long term trajectory of the market, the Core High-End Design market will grow at a CAGR of between 2% and 5% to reach a value of between €50 billion and €60 billion in 2026. For a description of the key drivers of growth in the high-end design market, see also “Industry and Market Data”. Increases in interest rates, which are determined and controlled by central banks in response to macroeconomic events (including the numerous increases applied by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve since mid-2022), may negatively affect general economic growth in the countries in which we operate and, consequently, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products as well as our financing costs. In 102 ----- addition, surging interest rates, among other factors, have also resulted in a material increase of our financial charges (primarily in respect of our Existing Floating Rate Notes) of €8.2 million (or 25.2%) from €32.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to €40.8 million for the same period in 2023. Moreover, as inflation and interest rates remain high, our ability to fund organic growth through capital expenditures may be negatively impacted. Inflation surges, the increase in energy prices, transportation costs and raw materials and a shift in consumer spending may also have a negative impact on our cost base (particularly on our service costs), on our revenue levels and on our overall profitability levels. Increases in our service costs could place strains on our working capital requirements if we are unable to increase the prices of our products proportionally. Given that we do not normally use derivatives to hedge the price fluctuation risk of, among others, input costs, if prices are volatile in the future, we might need to constantly adjust our sales prices, including on an extraordinary basis or more frequently than what we usually do, to maintain sufficient profitability. Even if we are successful in passing through cost increases to our customers, as we typically adjust the selling price of our products yearly, any lag between a change in the underlying input cost of our products and the time we surcharge our customers could affect our results of operations and profitability. Moreover, if we pass the increase in costs on to our customers by raising the prices of our products, the demand for our products may decline, in particular if competitors choose not to raise prices or if our customers decide to opt for cheaper solutions. In turn, if we are unable to pass cost increases on to our customers, we may experience pressure on our margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of the Group,17.4.2,Key Revenue and Cost Drivers by Sales Channel,"We generate our revenue from sales to customers through the following four sales channels, which we group in Direct-to-customer (including our Contract, Directly Operated Stores and Direct E-Commerce channels) and Wholesale (i.e. indirect sales): (i) _Contract. Our contract channel generated 30.7%, 27.7%, 26.8% and 19.7% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. It delivers bespoke design services for both residential and commercial customers, utilizing both products from our catalogues and custom-made products, as well as certain complementary products from third-party producers. Large “fit-out” projects in the contract channel normally generate significant revenue streams, although depending on the complexity and level of customization of each project, variable costs may be higher than in our other sales channels, including in connection with higher planning and design costs. (ii) _Directly-Operated Stores (“DOS”). Our DOS channel generated 6.9%, 6.4%, 6.1% and 6.2% of our revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we expect that it will represent an increasingly important channel for the sale of our products. It comprises retail stores that are directly managed from our headquarters and sell only products from our brands, either individually by brand or in a combination with products from our other brands. An example is our DOS in Boston, Massachusetts, which sells products from our B&B Italia, Maxalto, Azucena and Arclinea brands. We have increasingly invested in the openings of new DOS in recent years, and we expect that such investments will allow us to increase the share of consumers, specifiers and other customers to whom we sell our products directly. Unlike the wholesale channel, we have direct pricing control in the DOS channel and so our revenue reflects the end price of our products. However, we typically incur fixed costs in the DOS channel in connection with our stores that we do not have in our wholesale channel. The impact that such fixed costs have on our margins primarily depends on the location, geographic area and size of the relevant DOS. (iii) _Direct E-Commerce. Our direct online channel generated 11.6%, 12.5%, 7.0% and 0.8% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the material increase from 2020 to 2021 primarily attributable to the acquisition of Lumens (formerly YDesign) in June 2021. This channel encompasses our e-commerce websites selling in approximately 35 countries around the world and managed directly by our various companies, along with our online platform Lumens, which sells both products from our brands as well as third-party products. Our customers in this channel are typically consumers, architects, interior decorators and designers to whom we sell our products directly. We have direct pricing control in our online channel, as we do in our DOS channel, and our revenue generally reflects the end price of our products. Moreover, online sales do not require the operation of a physical store and delivery costs are normally paid by the customers. We expect that the online channel will continue to represent an increasingly important channel 103 ----- for the sale of our products. See “Summary—Our Strategies—Shift focus towards DTC and “branded” _channels, develop our store network and foster growth of our online segment”._ (iv) _Wholesale. Our wholesale channel generated 50.7%, 53.4%, 60.2% and 73.3% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. It comprises brick-and-mortar monobrand stores located around the world, shop-in-shops and multi-brand stores. The wholesale channel also includes e-tailers (e-commerce websites) and online retailers. The end customers of the wholesale channel are highly diversified and include consumers, specifiers (e.g. architects, designers, contractors, developers, etc.) and corporate customers. Revenue generated in the wholesale channel reflects a discount on the retail price of our products, which in turn represents profit for our direct customers. As part of our strategy, over the years we have increasingly focused our activities to direct-to-customer sales channels which resulted in lower incidence of the wholesale channel on our total revenues, from 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 50.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 (with part of this drop being due to the integration of Lumens into our business in 2021).",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of the Group,17.4.3,Research and Product Development and Technological Innovation,"Maintaining the appeal of our products to existing customers and attracting new customers depends in part on our ability to reflect prevailing trends and adapt to evolving technology and customer taste. In addition to the continuing popularity of some of our older iconic designs that represent a significant portion of our revenues, the historical success of our brands is also in part attributable to our ability to introduce products which are perceived to anticipate, shape and reflect interior design trends. Our investments in research and product development, including molds and prototypes, and technological innovation have allowed us to introduce new products and designs, or updates to historical products and designs (e.g., by introducing new upholstery materials) that we believe are high quality, aesthetically appealing, suited to our customers’ needs and technologically advanced. In 2022, we launched more than 90 new product families (including extensions of existing product lines and special editions). Most launches have been successful and product development has been a primary contributor to growth in revenue. We estimate that we generated approximately 25% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the sale of products we launched in the last three years. Moreover, we believe that providing designers with advanced research and development facilities that support their work by making available the most advanced technologies in the industry is key to attract and collaborate with established international designers with diverse professional experience and across different generations. For example, through the periods under review, B&B Italia has also improved the technological status at its production facilities. In particular, it upgraded technology in Caldogno (Italy), aiming to increase productivity and volumes of both the Arclinea kitchen and wardrobes and in Novedrate and Misinto (Italy) with the goal of increasing productivity and sales level of B&B Italia and Maxalto upholstery and furniture. We continue to invest in research and product development and technological innovation. To that end, we incurred capital expenditures for the development of our products and updates to existing products of €3.3 million, €6.4 million, €6.7 million and €6.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively (see also “—Capital Expenditure”).",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

We have a unique multi-dimensional brand-building ecosystem consisting of (i) a global presence, (ii) use of different media platforms and (iii) presence in DOS and branded wholesale supported by a coordinated and unified marketing strategy across channels, media and distributions. We focus our communication and marketing efforts on four main areas: brand experience, sales support, B2B relationships and B2C relationships and we have invested and continue to invest in communication and marketing as a key part of our business strategy. In particular, through sophisticated marketing tools across various media and channels, we aim to expand the recognition of our brands on the market, enhancing their value and increasing customer engagement across various touch points. Our marketing approach is implemented through (i) digital communication tools and publications in the main international media, (ii) events such as the Milan Design Week (Salone del Mobile) and other prestigious international events in the design field, (iii) sophisticated branded publications and magazines supporting sales and dealers, (iv) tools enhancing consumers’ experience in stores, (v) social media and key opinion leaders engagement and (vi) visibility resulting from special fashion collaborations or specific projects that are commissioned to us, including, among others, B&B for the Bulgari Hotel and Resorts in Tokyo, Paris and Rome, 104 ----- M+ Museum in Hong Kong, La Bella Vita, Taichung, Taiwan, One Thousand Museum Residences in Miami and The Whiteley in London. We constantly strive to entrench and combine the above-mentioned channels in order to efficiently bring to the final consumer a consistent brand image capable of expressing the values and correct market positioning of our brands. In the past years, we have implemented or started implementing several initiatives to increase efficiency and maximize the reach of our sales and marketing functions. Such initiatives, have led, among other things, to the establishment of dedicated sales organizations serving a number of key markets, with the result that most of the markets in which we are present now have dedicated sales organizations, internal marketing divisions, with an increase in the number of full-time employees in marketing and digital marketing functions as well as e-commerce departments. Advertising, marketing and promotional expenses generally tend to increase in connection with key design industry events, such as the Milan Design Fair (Salone del Mobile), Euroluce, held biennially within the Milan Design Fair, ICFF, held annually in New York and “3daysofdesign”, held annually in Copenhagen, and in the preparation phases that precede each new product launch as prototypes are developed, supply chains are engaged, production lines are prepared and marketing content is deployed to the sales force. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increasingly leveraged digital marketing tools and online communication which enable us to reach a wider range of potential customers, with interactions with followers growing rapidly in size and significance, while best optimizing our cost structure. Our advertising, marketing and promotional expenses represented approximately 5% to 6% of our sales from customers for each of the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022. From an operational perspective, we launched a centralized CRM platform, thus administering the interactions with customers in a more efficient way, leveraging the data gathered by each of our companies. This initiative allows our Contract sales organizations at each of Flos, B&B Italia, LP, Lumens, Fendi Casa and Audo to coordinate with each other and in the different geographical areas in which we operate. In 2021, we also strengthened Flos’ e-commerce potential by adding to the already existing e-commerce platform in the U.S., a twin platform enabling our customers to purchase Flos’ products in Europe. In 2022, B&B launched its e-commerce website in the United States, followed by certain other European countries in 2023, including France, Italy, Germany and Austria, thereby enabling our customers to buy a selection of B&B products online. We have also significantly expanded our brands’ digital marketing activities, strengthening their presence on the main social networks. In addition to targeted Google advertising and search engine optimization activity based on brand keywords, we maintain a strong presence on social media with accounts and fan pages on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, WeChat, Weibo and Little Red Book.

For example, for B&B and Maxalto, upholstered furniture, including sofas, armchairs, chairs and beds, generate the majority of revenue and are also the products that generate the highest gross margins, primarily because production occurs on an industrial scale through cost-efficient manufacturing processes (such as the application of polyurethane extrusions to a metal skeleton in a mold). Among the B&B furniture brands, Maxalto products have a higher price point than B&B Italia products primarily due to the different brand positioning of Maxalto and the exclusive materials utilized in the Maxalto collections (such as special leathers and precious wood), and normally generate higher gross margins, notwithstanding the higher production costs mostly deriving from the supply of such materials. In addition, sales effected through different distribution channels, whose margins vary, can impact our profitability and therefore our results of operations. For instance, sales generated by DOS may yield higher or lower gross margins than those generated through the wholesale channel, primarily depending on the performance of the individual store, as well as the impact of the fixed costs associated with the leases of the real estate property where our stores are located which vary by market and size of the individual store. In addition, gross margins in the wholesale channel are impacted by the wholesalers’ profit and, to the extent applicable, the relevant agents’ or distributors’ commissions, which are not applicable in the retail channel where we sell directly to consumers. As regards our geographic mix, through our six complementary companies, we have significant geographic diversity of sales that includes Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region. In particular, we operate directly or indirectly in more than 130 countries around the world. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 59.8%, 26.3% and 13.9% of our revenue from contracts with customers, respectively, in Europe, the 105 ----- Americas and APAC. Following the acquisition of Lumens, our geographic mix has reflected a higher contribution of the American area, as Lumens sells products primarily to customers in the United States and Canada, which resulted in our revenue from contracts with customers increasing from €132.8 million (or 19.8% of our total revenue from contracts with customers) for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €222.0 million (or 26.3% of our total revenue from contracts with customers) for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Most of our contractual arrangements with suppliers do not protect us from price increases and price lists are revisited quite frequently. Historically, we have not used derivatives to hedge the price fluctuation risk of our production cost components (including, for example, input, freight, energy and transportation costs), relying instead on our ability to pass on volatility to our customers through price increases. For example, despite the severe inflationary trend in 2022, we were able to pass on the vast majority of such price increases to our customers on a permanent basis, which contributed for substantially half of the revenues percentage increase for that period. Although raw materials and other components we purchase from suppliers normally represent a relatively small percentage of the price of our products, our margins are partially impacted by the relationship between the prices that we are able to charge for our products and the costs of input costs and components required to make these products, or of the finished or semifinished products we purchase where manufacturing activities are outsourced to the extent we are not able to pass on the full cost of such price increases. As a leading player in the high-end luxury industry, we are less affected by pricing pressure than other companies in different or adjacent markets. We normally increase the prices of our products on an annual basis at levels that are considered reasonable and take into account a number of factors, including our market positioning vis-à-vis our competitors, market analysis on pricing trends in our industry, inflation, increases in sourcing costs, fluctuations of the exchange rate of the currencies of the various destination markets. In particular, price increases are often the result of an analysis that we perform on the current and expected market trend, which takes into account how we position ourselves compared to our direct and indirect competitors. From time to time, price increases are also the result of an increase in our sourcing costs or the cost of the services we outsourced for, among others, the manufacturing of our products. In addition to price increases, we are typically able to optimize the level of production that we outsource, particularly at B&B Italia’s which, alongside a number of improvements we implemented across the supply chain targeted at reducing costs and operating expenses, ultimately enhanced our ability to maintain and increase our margins over time. These improvements include, among others, renegotiation of supply contracts with certain key suppliers of raw materials and product components, streamlining the supplier base and reducing packaging costs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Our use of digital technologies aims to create more effective business relationships with our customers (such as dealers, end-customers, and specifiers), enhance customer experience in line with evolving market expectations and customer habits, offer innovative design services to customers through a data-driven, client-centric relationship approach. Since 2020, we have started deploying a two-level organization, with certain key digital competences shared at Group level and existing IT competences reinforced at the level of each of the Group companies. In particular, our activities have focused on: (i) increasing the automation process through the use of the CRM platform, which enables us processing data to create, among others, tailored marketing campaigns; (ii) simplifying the IT application of each of our companies, including by using the same SAP ERP platform across the companies focusing on the lighting business (LP and Flos) and the same Oracle platform across the companies focusing on the sale of furniture (B&B Italia and Arclinea); 106 ----- (iii) introducing a common platform for the entire Group’s e-commerce applications; and (iv) developing advanced configurator systems, that allow both B2B and B2C customers, distributors and specifiers to create their customized products online. In addition, our companies have made continuous progress on the digitalization of their business model, by expanding the geographical reach and access of their corporate websites and e-commerce platforms. Among other things, in 2020, Audo (then doing business as Designers Company) optimized its entire operating platform to increase product quality, delivery accuracy, and seamless customer service, while also implementing significant digitalization improvements, such as updating the website layout, creating a new digital sales tool and opening its own operational web-shop in Europe.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of the Group,17.4.8,Supply Chain and Sourcing,"Supply chain and sourcing is specific to the various brands of the Group. For example, for the Flos brand, we outsource almost all of our manufacturing requirements to carefully selected third-party assemblers, with part of production on a make-to-order basis in order to preserve cost efficiencies given the wide range of techniques and materials required for the manufacture of Flos products. The outsourcing of most manufacturing processes lowers Flos’ fixed cost base, which results in operational and financial flexibility, as Flos may adapt to customer demand by increasing or decreasing production, without a significant impact on margins. Suppliers and assemblers are carefully selected mainly according to their technical capacity, quality, financial stability and cost and are usually located in close proximity to our facilities to minimize transaction costs and lead times. For the Louis Poulsen and B&B Italia brands, we outsource certain manufacturing processes to carefully selected third-party assemblers, with the majority of B&B production being made on a make-to-order basis in order to preserve cost efficiencies given the wide range of techniques and materials required to manufacture B&B’s furniture. While outsourcing for Louis Poulsen and B&B Italia is typically considerably lower than Flos’, the outsourcing of some manufacturing processes reduces such companies’ fixed cost base, hence resulting in high operational and financial flexibility. For the Fendi Casa brand, production is entirely made-to-order, with the exception of the accessories, while Audo’s production is entirely outsourced. Suppliers of furniture products are mainly located in the Baltic countries while those in the lighting and accessories sector are mainly located in China. The flexible operational structure of our companies allows us to decide what level of production to outsource based on our customers’ demand, therefore further increasing our ability to adjust to different market conditions timely and efficiently.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of the Group,17.4.9,Fluctuations in currency exchange rates,"We operate worldwide and have non-euro denominated assets, liabilities, revenue and costs. We are exposed to limited currency risk, particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, Danish Krone and Yen against the euro, our reporting currency. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived approximately 43% of our revenue from sales in non-euro currencies (mainly U.S. Dollar and Danish Krone). We currently do not maintain currency hedges in place. _Transaction risk_ Our exchange rate transaction risks principally relate to having a strong international presence. Our other fixed costs, such as energy, personnel and services related to production are typically denominated in the currency of the country where the relevant production facility is located (e.g., euro for Italy, U.S. dollar for the U.S., etc.). Additionally, our customer contracts are typically payable in the currency of the country where the contract is signed or the sale is made, as applicable. By having operations worldwide, we seek to match our operating costs with operating revenue in each of the major currencies in which we operate. To the extent that we have incurred expenses that are not denominated in the same currency as related revenue, exchange rate fluctuations may in some cases cause our expenses to increase or decrease as a percentage of total revenue. We believe, however, that using the euro as the transactional currency for most transactions almost eliminates the risk tied to fluctuations in exchange rates. _Translation Risk_ 107 ----- Our currency translation risk is primarily related to the recognition of revenue generated by subsidiaries during our period-end consolidation and reporting. To prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Group, we translate assets, liabilities, total revenue and expenses into euro at applicable exchange rates. To determine the applicable exchange rate, assets and liabilities are converted using the exchange rates prevailing at the reference date of the relevant consolidated financial statements, and costs and revenue are converted at the average exchange rate for the relevant period.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In general, such transaction impact the comparability of our results of operations from period to period. In addition, following an acquisition, we may be required to, or may elect to, make certain investments in the acquired assets or companies, including to integrate them into our operational structure. The following is a description of the key acquisitions and other transactions completed during the periods under review: - in June 2021, we indirectly acquired Lumens (formerly YDesign), which specializes in the online offering of modern and contemporary lighting, fans, furniture and accessories to design-driven consumers and trade professionals through the website Lumens.com. Through the acquisition of Lumens, we expanded our e-commerce sales channel in the North American market. Prior to its acquisition by the Group in 2021, for the year ended December 31, 2020, Lumens generated net sales of USD163.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €11.7 million (equivalent) calculated by converting Adjusted EBITDA from U.S. dollars into euro by applying an exchange rate equal to 0.88$/€, corresponding to the average exchange rate for the period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. As Lumens was consolidated in our financial statements starting from June 2021, such acquisition affected the comparability of all of our results for the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, we funded the acquisition of Lumens through a portion of the proceeds from the issuance in May 2021 of the Issuer’s €470.0 million aggregate principal amount of Existing Floating Rate Notes (which replaced the Issuer’s previously existing €320.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2025), as a result of which our debt and associated interest expense increased as compared to the prior year. The total consideration we paid for the acquisition of Lumens was USD 179.2 million; - in 2021, we also entered into a joint venture agreement with Fendi, the Italian luxury brand that is part of the LVMH Group, for the establishment of FF Design, in which we indirectly hold an 80% stake, while Fendi holds the remaining 20%. The agreement includes the licensing of Fendi’s registered trademarks, including “Fendi Casa”, along with other intellectual property rights. This strategic collaboration aims to develop the brand Fendi Casa, the home segment of Fendi, by designing, producing, and distributing collections that reflect the brand’s style as well as the expertise of our Group; - in May 2022, with the objective of consolidating our market position in the European market and in the U.S., we acquired Designers Company, a Danish holding company that included the brands Menu, by Lassen and Audo, each a designer, manufacturer, and distributer of furniture, lighting, and accessories with a Nordic style. In June 2023, Menu, by Lassen and The Audo merged into the new brand “Audo” with the aim of enhancing the Nordic-style design archives owned by Designers Company; and - prior to its acquisition by the Group in 2022, for the year ended December 31, 2021, Audo generated revenues of €53.9 million (equivalent) and Adjusted EBITDA of €9.3 million (equivalent) calculated by converting Revenue/Adjusted EBITDA from DKK into euro by applying an exchange rate equal to 7.44 DKK/€, corresponding to the average exchange rate for the period from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. The total consideration for the acquisition of Audo (including deferred consideration but net of transaction costs) amounts to DKK 977.364,000 (approximately €131.4 million as of December 31, 2022 by applying an exchange rate of 7.44 DKK per euro). In addition, the Audo SPA (as defined herein) provides, among others, that in addition to the purchase price, the seller thereunder would be entitled to an earn-out for an amount of DKK 80,000,000 (approximately €10.8 million as of December 31, 2022 by applying an exchange rate of 7.44 DKK per euro) in case Audo’s turnover for the 108 ----- financial year 2023 had reached DKK 529,400,000 (approximately €71 million by applying an exchange rate of 7.44 DKK per euro).

Various governments around the world, including Italy, adopted measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. These measures, along with decreased consumer spending and widespread uncertainty following months of lockdowns and other restrictive orders, led to an economic downturn in our markets and had a direct impact on our business across all of the countries in which we operated at the time. In particular, several of the governments of such countries imposed significant lockdown measures in order to control the spread of COVID-19, including the government of Italy, which imposed the temporary closure of all of our manufacturing facilities and the stores in which our products are sold. Similar measures were adopted by the governments of several other countries in which we operate. Although the nationwide lockdowns were gradually lifted (e.g., on May 4, 2020, in Italy), significant restrictions and social distancing measures were imposed. In particular, our Contract and DOS experienced a decline as compared to prior years, as our DOS were repeatedly shut for several weeks or otherwise faced reduced opening hours as a result of the measures adopted by the competent government and authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. We also experienced a decline in the demand for bespoke design and contract projects, such as large fit-outs, during the lockdown periods, given our customers in the hospitality, retail, travel industries were severely impacted by restrictions put in place following the onset of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic affected our financial performance, particularly in 2020, across our operations, exerting downward pressure on global sales as a result of government regulatory constraints. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred €1.7 million of costs related to COVID-19, such as cost for enhanced safety measures in our plants, stores and offices, increased shipping costs, and non-reimbursable costs that we incurred for setting up fairs that were cancelled. Such additional costs and expenses were only partially offset by cost reduction initiatives such as reduction of discretionary spend, absence of travels and diminished marketing expenses due to the cancellation of fairs and other events. In addition, we benefitted from certain subsidies available to us as a result of the measures adopted by the governments of the countries in which we operate, including recourse to Cassa _Integrazione in Italy, ERE in Spain and furlough in the United States._ Notwithstanding, our strong performance in 2019 and in the first few months of 2020 enabled us to enter the COVID-19 crisis from a position of financial strength; in addition, the positive performance of our business in the second half of the year, including due to our e-commerce capabilities as well as growth in the online furnishing market, limited the negative effects of the prolonged shutdowns and other restrictive measures in most of the countries in which we operate. While we were negatively impacted by certain COVID-19 related restrictions and lockdowns in 2020, our revenues in 2021 increased compared to 2020 following the progressive easing and removal of the relevant restrictions in the countries in which we operate. We believe that our business has demonstrated resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, with revenues recording a robust recovery following the easing of restrictions. We continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business to ensure the safety of our employees and to be in a position to quickly react to any operational developments, logistics disruptions and any adverse developments in our financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.49,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.49.2,,"Liquidity describes the ability of a group to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditure, debt service obligations, other commitments, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily to operate our business, meet our debt service obligations, fund capital expenditures, including for our research and product development activities, fund salaries and other associated costs, fund acquisitions and pay taxes. Our primary source of liquidity is our cash from operating activities. Drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility represent a supplemental source of liquidity which we utilize from time to time primarily for working capital requirements. For instance, as a precautionary measure, we entirely drew the Revolving Credit Facility on March 17, 2020 to strengthen our cash position in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we fully repaid in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect that €18.6 million of drawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will remain outstanding following the Refinancing. In addition, in the event that freely available cash on our balance sheet on or about the Issue Date is lower than our estimate, we may draw down additional amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date or shortly thereafter. On or around the Issue Date, we expect to upsize the Revolving Credit Facility from €100.0 million to €140.0 million, hence further enhancing our liquidity sources. In the periods under review, our debt service obligations consisted primarily of interest payments on the Existing Notes (as well as certain previously existing senior secured floating rate notes due 2025 which we refinanced in 2021 through the issuance of the Existing Floating Rate Notes) and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Following the Transactions, including the offering of the Notes and the application of the proceeds therefrom, our debt service obligations will consist primarily of interest payments on the Notes and the Existing Floating Rate Notes and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with available borrowings, will be adequate to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or other debt, including the Existing Floating Rate Notes, when due. If our cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure requirements exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depend on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions, and capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing our debt, and our general financial performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and Our Indebtedness—Our substantial leverage and debt service _obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and Our Indebtedness—The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and depends exclusively on cash from its operating companies”._",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The decrease was primarily due to higher financial interest paid due to the increase in the applicable interest rate on our floating rate indebtedness, from €25.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to €33.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 120 ----- Net cash flow from operating activities decreased by €21.6 million or 22.8% from €94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a change in net working capital from positive €12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to negative €25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, higher income taxes paid in 2022 due to the increase in business activity in the preceding year as well as higher financial interest paid for the year ended December 31, 2022 in connection with the increase in the applicable interest rate on our floating rate indebtedness, which offset the higher profit for 2022 compared to 2021. Net cash flow from operating activities increased by €26.4 million or 38.7% from €68.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 including as a result of strong business growth for the year as well as the positive contribution of the change in net working capital which amounted to €12.6 million in 2021 compared to €0.3 million in 2020. _Net cash flows from / (used in) investing activities_ Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by €74.0 million or 80.6% from €91.8 million for the six month ended June 30, 2022 to €17.8 million for the six month ended June 30, 2023.

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by €153.3 million from €20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Lumens in 2021 for €131.3 million, net of cash acquired as well as €7.5 million of cash invested in acquisition of non-current financial assets in 2021, compared to € nil in 2020. _Net cash flows from / (used in) financing activities_ Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by €6.0 million or more than 100% from €4.0 million for the six month ended June 30, 2022 to €10.0 million for the six month ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the balance between the amount of the first tranche of the deferred price for the acquisition of Audo (€39.0 million) and the cash from the drawdown of the Revolving Credit Facility in January 2023 (€29.8 million). Net cash flows used in financing activities amounted to €18.7 million (mainly consisting of payments of principal amount of lease liabilities for €16.2 million) for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash flow from investing activities of €130.5 million (mainly consisting of the difference between the floating rate notes which were redeemed in 2021 and the Existing Floating Rate Notes which were issued in connection therewith).

The Group’s exposure to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates arises mainly from the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or costs are denominated in a foreign currency) and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Although the Group has a strong international presence, use of the Euro as the transactional currency for most transactions currently mitigates the risk tied to exchange rate fluctuations. The Group is mainly exposed to positions denominated in Euro, Danish Krone, Yen and U.S. Dollar; however, current volumes do not have a material impact on the Group’s financial and economic results.

The Core High-End Design market is comprised of the following segments: - Living and Bedroom: includes living room and bedroom products, such as upholstery, beds, drawers, tables, cabinets, desks, chairs and other furnishings; - Kitchen: includes fitted kitchens, kitchen units, cupboards and other furniture and decorative items; - Bathroom: includes bathroom equipment products such as bath tubs, whirlpools, ceramics, bathroom furniture, sanitary fittings, faucets, shower units and related accessories; - Lighting: includes lighting products for both indoor and outdoor use such as pendants, floor lamps, wall lamps, light fixtures, fittings and other lighting products; and - Outdoor: includes outdoor furniture items such as tables, sofas, chairs and other items for residential and commercial use. The segmentation of the Core High-End Design market for 2021 is represented below. Source: Industry Report, Management Estimates 125 ----- While our product portfolio spans all segments of the Core High-End Design market, we primarily operate in the Living and Bedroom and in the Lighting segments. Living and Bedroom represents the largest segment of the Core High-End Design market, accounting for almost 50% of the market total value in 2021. The distribution of high-end furniture and lighting products occurs through both direct and indirect channels: - Wholesale: includes products sold through a network of third-party distributors, agents, and dealers across a range of formats, including third-party mono-brand stores and shop-in-shops, corners and displays within multi-brand design retailers, as well as online third-party retailers, to various types of customers including personal consumers, architects, designers, contractors, developers and corporate customers; - Retail: includes products sold directly by the producer through dedicated directly-operated stores (comparable to our DOS channel); - Contract: includes bespoke design services for residential and commercial customers; and - Online: includes sales through both directly operated and third-party operated e-commerce websites (in contrast to the Group’s direct online channel, which only includes directly operated e-commerce websites). The Core High-End Design market has been growing steadily over the past few years. Between 2019 and 2022, the market grew at a CAGR of 7%. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, between 2014 and 2019, the market grew at a CAGR of 5%. Management estimates that 2023 will experience a slight decline in growth based on temporary headwinds which they do not expect will affect the long-term trajectory of the market. Between 2022 and 2026, the market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of between 2% and 5%. While data for 2026 are still provisional, preliminary forecasts estimate the Core High-End Design market reaching the range of €50 to €60 billion, with structural tailwinds driving the growth: - Cocooning & self-expression: Covid-19 has reshaped the relationship between individuals and interiors, driving demand across home categories: interior design is becoming an aesthetic aid to inner peace and wellbeing with the home representing a focal point for everyday life activities, providing a personal ‘safer’ shelter; and furniture as a means for self-expression with increased “at home” conviviality with enlarged groups of people entering our houses through work video conferencing and at home social moments; - Space hybridization: Living spaces are transforming into “multi-purpose” areas, equipped for several functions such as home office, gym at home and spa-feel bedroom etc.; - Everything but better: Outside of the home, design consumption is increasingly driven by a continuous appetite for High End Design and a refined aesthetic together with a progressive evolution of commercial spaces toward residential aesthetics and search for improved quality and a refined aesthetic of spaces; - Wealth ruralization: Major metropolitan areas will remain central, although dispersion of wealthy people across suburban areas is accelerating, creating additional demand for holiday houses and investments in furnishing; and - Further urbanization in emerging market: Urbanization remains a significant trend in emerging markets especially with the expanding Chinese middle class and can be a catalyst for high end design product demand. 126 ----- Source: Industry Report, Management Estimates",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

However, the market is generally influenced by three key factors: - GDP growth; - real estate market conditions; and - consumer confidence and disposable income. These factors tend to affect or reflect consumer behavior towards the purchasing of lighting and furniture products. While demand for high-end design products is generally less price-elastic than for products in other segments, slowdowns in real estate development also tend to affect high-end design products’ demand. Other factors affecting market performance include demographic and socio-economic trends, such as: - increasing urbanization rates, especially in emerging economies; - decreasing average household size; - improving availability of western consumer goods driven by the increasing prevalence of large organized retail chains in many large emerging economies; and - rapid growth of middle and high-income middle classes in emerging markets, who are increasingly oriented towards sophisticated and high-end design products.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.2,General Factors Affecting Our Market,5.2.2,Other factors,"Demand is also affected by product innovation deriving from technological advances. The introduction of LED technology in the lighting segment, for instance, has fostered the design of new products, while also lowering production costs. The efficiency of LED technology has acted as a further driver of demand, bolstered by the importance of energy saving solutions in modern projects and certifications (e.g. LEED). Other factors influencing demand are the availability of credit (including both the availability of financing for real estate developments and the provision of mortgage financings) and the product replacement cycle (i.e. the frequency with which consumers purchase replacement products). Consumer spending trends across different segments show that: - the Lighting and Outdoor segments are generally characterized by shorter replacement cycles and lower average pricing per item (given the typically smaller size of these items); and 127 ----- - the Kitchen segment is generally characterized by longer product replacement cycles and higher pricing per item.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.3,Envisaged market evolution,5.3.1,,"Europe (including Turkey and Russia) accounts for approximately 44% of the high-end design market, the Americas (including North and South America) accounts for approximately 31%, APAC (including Asia and Japan but excluding Australia and New Zealand) accounts for approximately 19% and the Rest of the World accounts for approximately 7%. The increasing importance of the APAC region in the global Core High-End Design market has been driven by continued demand over the last few years, mainly reflecting the economic performance of the reference economies. Less pronounced market growth in Europe in recent years has led to an increase in the relative share of APAC and the Americas in the overall market. Rebounding GDP growth in the world’s larger economies following the COVID-19 pandemic, the renewed “home role”, the recovery of the real estate market coupled with historical trends such as a rising class of middle and high-income consumers in emerging markets, and the ongoing “westernization” of Asian consumer preferences are all expected to have a positive impact on future demand. We expect the increase in demand will be driven primarily by the APAC region, with expected growth per annum to 2026 at 11%. Demand in Europe and Americas is expected to further benefit from favorable demand trends with expected growth per annum of 5% and 6% respectively.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.4,Competition,5.4.1,,"We distinguish three main groups of competitors in the markets in which we operate: - pure design, personal luxury and designer-driven brands; - premium design brands; and - branded retailers. Pure design brands (including Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen) are usually European independent players who have developed significant design heritage through a long track record of iconic products. Pure design brands are characterized by their strong design roots, collaborations with prestigious architects and designers, iconic products and international reach, primarily through multi-brand retailers, as well as by their high specialization and strong production skills. Other notable pure design brands include Artemide, Vitra, Poltrona Frau and Bulthaup. 128 ----- Personal luxury brands are typically large luxury brands that have diversified into homewares. Personal luxury brands rely on their brand strength to market their products and as a result, the design of the products tends to reflect the influence of the style of the brand’s creative directors. Personal luxury brands typically rely on external production and utilize a mixed distribution model, with sales through a combination of multi-brand retailers and directly operated stores. Personal luxury brands include brands such as Armani Casa, Fendi Casa, Kenzo and Versace. Designer-driven brands are typically managed by a single iconic designer who leverage their “brand name” to generate demand. Designer-driven brands tend to position their products as a lifestyle offering, characterized by a strong identity and recognizable style. Production of designer-driven brands is typically external. Examples of designer-driven brands are Liaigre and Visionnaire. Premium design brands are typically Lighting and Furniture retailers that either have general upper-premium positioning (with differences among geographies) or have more mainstream positioning but have extended certain product lines into the upper-premium range. This includes brands such as Ligne Roset, Cattelan Italia, Moen and Kos. Branded retailers are typically geographically specific mono-brand retailers with an upper-premium positioning, such as Restoration Hardware, Williams Sonoma and Design Within Reach. The degree of competition among these brands differs by geographic area. Branded retailers have had considerable success in the United States market and their significant growth over the last few years has been partially linked to the overall positive performance of the United States economy. Retailers accounted for approximately 15% of the total Core High-End Design market by value in 2021. Pure design brands tend to be more common in the European market, but are also present in the United States market, predominantly in large cities such as Los Angeles and New York. The competitive environment in Europe remains more fragmented, with small pure design brands addressing specific customer segments or serving a specific design taste in niche markets. Personal luxury brands are more popular in emerging economies, which is where most of their revenues originate. Premium and pure design brands accounted for approximately 84% of the market in 2021. 129 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

We believe that we are approximately 1.2 times larger than our closest competitor, almost 2 times larger than our second closest competitor and 3.2 to 3.8 times larger than our third through fifth closest competitors, in each case based on 2022 revenues and our analysis of publicly available financial data for such year. Despite our size, our reference market is highly fragmented. We focus on the luxury segment of the core high-end design market, characterized by rich product heritage, strong and globally recognized brands, iconic products, superior craftmanship, brand exclusivity and premiumness. We estimate our market share to be approximately 4% based on 2022 revenues and our analysis of publicly available financial data for such year, implying a tangible opportunity to further consolidate our market share by expanding in underpenetrated geographies. Many of our brands and products have received various international design accolades and the highest industry awards throughout their history, including 16 Compasso d’Oro awards (including the Compasso d’Oro Product Lifetime Achievement Award awarded to Flos’ Arco lamp in 2020), the first of which in 1955 and the last of which in 2022, NYCxDesign Award, IF Gold Award, IF Design Award, FX Interior Design Awards, Danish Design Award, German Design Award, Elle Deco International Design Award and Lighting Design Award. Our products are held in the permanent collections of art and design museums such as the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Le Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Design Museum in Copenhagen, La Triennale di Milano in Milan and the Today Art Museum in Beijing, confirming the excellence, renown and appeal of our designs. We estimate that in 2022 the luxury design market (a subset of the global luxury market), which is our focus market, represented approximately 63% (valued at approximately €31 billion in that same period) of the total core high-end design market, with the remaining approximately 37% represented by the premium design market (valued at approximately €16 billion in that same period), typically addressed by branded retailers and premium design brands. The global luxury market grew at a CAGR of 6% between 2014 and 2019 and 3% between 2019 and 2022, reaching €1.4 trillion in 2022, while the global core high-end design market grew at a CAGR of 5% between 2014 and 2019 and 7% between 2019 and 2022, notwithstanding a moderate contraction in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The global core high-end design market exceeded pre-pandemic levels already in 2021, reaching €40 billion in such year (compared to €38 billion in 2019 and €35 billion in 2020), continued to grow in 2022, reaching €47 billion, and is estimated to further grow between 2022 and 2026 at a CAGR of between 2% and 5%, reaching approximately €50 to €60 billion in 2026. For 2023, temporary headwinds are expected to affect the global core high-end design market, while the mid-term outlook remains broadly unchanged. Between 2014 to 2022, we outperformed our reference market by increasing our revenues at a CAGR of 9% for each period, which enabled us to reinforce our market positioning, notwithstanding a moderate contraction in 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Our CAGR for these periods was calculated on the basis of like-for-like growth of certain of our acquired brands beginning from the year of their respective acquisition (namely, Flos in 2014, B&B in 2015, Louis Poulsen in 2018 and Lumens in 2021). The growth of the high-end design market is driven by certain structural tailwinds, including (i) the increasing working time that people spend in their homes (estimated to be approximately 3.5 days per week in 2022, 132 ----- compared to approximately 2.6 days per week prior to COVID-19 pandemic), with approximately 98% of workers indicating that they prefer to work remotely, in part due to the change of work habits resulting from the COVID19 pandemic, (ii) the increased use of home offices (with approximately 60% of the people working from home estimated to have a dedicated home office space) and the increasingly important role played by kitchens, which are often considered the heart of the home (with approximately 60% of kitchen renovators having upgraded or added a kitchen island), (iii) the global GDP increase driven by infrastructure renovation (estimated to have contributed approximately 20% of the global GDP growth from 2010 to 2020), (iv) wealth ruralization, which has caused migration of wealth to rural communities and countryside, thereby increasing the demand for high-end design products (with over 50% of adults estimated to prefer living in small towns and rural areas compared to approximately 39% in 2018), and (v) the urbanization trends and associated economic growth in emerging markets, in particular China and India, with an urbanization index estimated to reach approximately 116 and 113, respectively, in 2025 (compared to approximately 100 for both countries in 2016). In addition, the high-end design market is characterized by smaller competitors, making us one of the few design groups that can serve a diverse customer base across a variety of product and service categories and geographies, enabling us to benefit from cross-selling initiatives and giving us the opportunity to grow through selected strategic acquisitions in the segments where we currently operate or in complementary adjacent segments.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.7,Our Competitive Strengths,5.7.2,Balanced and highly resilient portfolio of iconic designs and new products generating a predictable revenue mix,"Our internationally-acclaimed product portfolios represent a balance between timeless heritage designs and innovative products. Certain iconic designs have become synonymous with our brands and continue to attract significant customer demand decades after being introduced. We believe that maintaining these products in our portfolio helps to limit the effect of market trends and improves our revenue resiliency. Our internal research and product development teams work closely with our designers to continually update and reconfigure iconic pieces to meet the evolving needs and tastes of our customers while maintaining the identity of each of our brands and the distinctive original features that loyal customers worldwide have long associated with our products. Moreover, to further support the success of our most iconic designs and refresh existing and new customers’ interest in our products, from time to time, we also launch new special or limited editions of our heritage products, such as Flos’ Arco K lamp in 2022 with an innovative crystal base, B&B Italia’s Le Bambole x Stella McCartney in 2023, as a result of a collaboration with the renowned English stylist, and PH Pale Rose, a special edition collection of Louis Poulsen’s PH lamps designed in 1926, which we launched in 2022. We also launch new products on an ongoing basis to complement our portfolio of heritage designs and our design portfolio also comprises numerous unexploited heritage designs from prestigious international designers that have not been commercialized before, which we believe represents an important growth opportunity for our Group. For example, we estimate that Louis Poulsen, Audo, B&B and Flos have a significant archive with unexploited designs from heritage designers dating back to the 1950s and 1970s. Between 2020 and 2023, our brands have reintroduced several heritage designs from their archives, including “Camaleonda” and “Scacchi” from B&B Italia, certain versions of “La Lampadina” by Flos, and the “PH Septima Pendant” and “PH 2/2 Question” from Louis Poulsen. Our efforts in research and product development and innovation in both design and technology ensure both the longevity of our iconic products and the continued introduction of creative and successful new designs, all of which ensures a balanced and predictable revenue mix. The following chart sets forth the revenue of B&B Italia, Maxalto, Flos and Louis Poulsen for the year ended December 31, 2022, divided by launch year of the products that these brands sold in such year (i.e. before 2010, between 2010 and 2017 and between 2018 and 2022). 133 ----- Our revenue mix is well balanced relative to the year of launch of the various products we sell in any given period. We believe that such balanced revenue mix, coupled with the significant contribution of made-to-order sales to our total sales, gives us good visibility of our expected revenue streams in the short term (approximately eight weeks for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, providing estimated revenue visibility of approximately two months for our made-to-order products).",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Our iconic brands benefit from association with a broad base of (i) prestigious and globally renowned designers, such as Mario Bellini, Antonio Citterio, Vincent Van Duysen, Piero Lissoni, Philippe Starck, Jasper Morrison, Gaetano Pesce, Olafur Eliasson, Patricia Urquiola, Nendo, Michael Anastassiades, Konstantin Grcic, Naoto Fukusawa, Barber & Osgerby, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec and Formafantasma; (ii) heritage designers, such as Tobia Scarpa, Poul Henningsen, Arne Jacobsen, Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Gino Sarfatti, Mogens Lassen, Flemming Lassen and Verner Panton; and (iii) talented emerging designers, such as Chiara Andreatti, Anne Boysen, Joris Laarman, Gabriel Tan, Øivind Alexander Slaatto and Peter Mabeo. Many of our designer partners have received multiple awards and recognitions for their designs and have their designs held in the collections of museums around the world. We believe our privileged relationships with renowned designers and our ability to attract new promising designers represent a significant competitive advantage. Some of our designers have collaborated with our brands for many years, creating a strong design relationship and mutual understanding of the needs and preferences of our customer base. Our relationship with designers is mutually beneficial, as it allows us to expand our brand recognition across a wider customer demographic and adds value for the designers, who gain prestige and visibility by working with leading furniture and lighting brands. Designers collaborate closely with our internal research and product development teams, which have accumulated extensive technical expertise and industry knowledge over decades and continually support our design innovation. The research and product development teams add substantial value to designers, providing an extensive knowledge base on product feasibility with respect to design, materials and market success; research on the latest trends, materials and technological innovations; design and development support for concepts, prototypes and molds; negotiation support with suppliers to ensure high component quality standards at competitive prices; and centralized assembly process and production planning. In addition, management teams at each of our brands ensure that any new design that is being proposed or considered internally is fully consistent with the relevant brand’s image and philosophy, which we believe is key to the success of any product and the continued integrity of our brands. In addition to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with world-renowned designers, we also benefit from strong relationships with a widespread network of specifiers, especially smaller, committed professional design and architecture studios that continually choose and promote our products to meet the design needs of their clients. We consider these specifiers, which we define as any party that is involved in the purchasing decision but is not the end user of our products, including but not limited to architects, interior designers, lighting engineers 134 ----- and landscape architects, a loyal and resilient customer intermediary that, through repeat business, provides us with a significant competitive advantage locally in the geographic markets we serve and add to our recognition with end customers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.7,Our Competitive Strengths,5.7.4,"Diversified business model across product categories, geographies and distribution channels with low customer concentration risk","Our business is well diversified across product categories, geographies and distribution channels. We offer a broad and diversified portfolio of products addressing the full spectrum of our customers’ requirements and we believe we are not dependent on any specific product category. Our product offering is comprised of two product categories, lighting and furniture, which accounted for 64.0% and 34.1% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, giving _pro forma effect to the acquisition of Audo as if it had occurred on January 1, 2022. The lighting category includes our decorative, architectural and outdoor products, which accounted for 27.0%, 11.1% and 5.7% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively). The furniture category includes our living room and bedroom furniture and kitchen products (which accounted for 19.6% and 4.0% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively). Geographically, our business benefits from a balanced and diversified reach, with more than 130 countries served. The United States and Italy, as individual countries, represent the two largest contributors to our sales and accounted for 23.7% and 14.2% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Customers outside of our home geographies of Italy and Denmark generated approximately 79.3% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022, and approximately 26.0% of our GMV for such period was generated from sales in North America which were mainly attributable to Lumens, our digital e-commerce platform of lighting, accessories and furniture in the United States, which we acquired in 2021. We expect the APAC region and North America to continue to drive growth, with consistent demand also expected in our home geographies and Western Europe. We also benefit from a diversified distribution network comprised of four distribution channels (contract, ecommerce, DOS and wholesale), enabling us to reach a broad range of customers. We expect our omni-channel distribution network will continue to represent a key contributor to our growth, driven in particular by our ecommerce business, which grew from €3.9 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 (or 0.7% of our revenue from contracts with customers in such year) to €103.7 million of revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 (or 12.2% of our revenue from contracts with customers for such period), mainly as a result of the acquisition of our U.S. based e-commerce platform Lumens in 2021. For further details on our distribution channels, see “—Sophisticated omni-channel distribution network focused on DTC and branded channels, _optimizing customer reach and maximizing brand strength”._ In addition to a diversified mix of product categories, geographies and distribution channels, we benefit from low customer concentration risk. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our top 20 customers generated 18.9% of our revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.7,Our Competitive Strengths,5.7.5,"Sophisticated omni-channel distribution network focused on DTC and branded channels, optimizing customer reach and maximizing brand strength","Our distribution network is comprised of three direct-to-customer (“DTC”) channels (contract, DOS and ecommerce) and the wholesale channel. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the wholesale channel generated approximately 47.2%, the contract channel approximately 24.5%, the DOS network approximately 5.7% and ecommerce sales approximately 22.6% of our GMV, respectively. Our omni-channel approach allows us to reach a wide range of diversified customers both directly via our contract, DOS and e-commerce channels, and indirectly via our wholesale channel through a variety of intermediate players, including dealers, resellers, retailers and an extensive network of approximately 350,000 loyal specifiers, including architects and designers serving the local markets where we are present, which in our experience have a high degree of influence over the end customers purchase decisions. We believe our omni-channel distribution network optimizes customer reach and maximizes the strength of our brands. _Contract_ Our contract channel delivers bespoke design services to customers that are not typically accessible through traditional retail outlets, including residential and commercial customers, utilizing both products from our catalogues and custom made products, as well as certain complementary products from third party producers. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our contract channel has approximately 12,000 projects in pipeline. 135 ----- Among some of the notable recent projects completed by the Contract division are the One Thousand Museum Residences by Zaha Hadid Architects in Miami, The Polaris Lounge by Studio SCB Chicago and the Bulgari Hotel in Tokyo and Rome by Antonio Citterio and Patricia Viel. We believe the wide variety of commercial customers and the larger scale of contract projects make our contract channel a strong vehicle for cross-selling opportunities, increasing the visibility of the products from all our brands and our market penetration. Although a large proportion of contract work is currently driven by B&B, the combination of our brands has provided us with the opportunity to broaden the scope of our contract work, offering a floor-to-ceiling contract service encompassing furnishings from B&B, kitchens from Arclinea and lighting products from Flos and Louis Poulsen. _DOS_ Our DOS channel is a powerful marketing tool that drives brand awareness, allows full control over our brands and often provides enhanced visibility to our end customers. It comprises retail stores that sell only products from our brands, either individually by brand or in a combination with products from our other brands, thereby increasing cross selling opportunities by giving our customers the opportunity to purchase such products. As an example, our new DOS in Boston, Massachusetts, sells products from our B&B Italia, Maxalto and Arclinea brands. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our DOS channel includes 19 stores managed directly by our Group companies, all located in key luxury markets around the world in cities such as Milan, London, New York, Paris and Hong Kong. DOS and directly-operated showrooms are a highly valuable distribution channel as they not only drive sales, but also increase brand strength, serving as a hub for marketing events and design fairs. _E-Commerce_ Our e-commerce channel consists of our e-commerce websites selling in 36 geographies across the world and managed directly by our various companies, along with our U.S. online platform Lumens, which sells both products from our brands as well as third-party products. _Wholesale_ Our wholesale channel includes 5,521 brick-and-mortar points of sale throughout the world, managed by third parties, in various different formats, with a special focus on (i) mono-brand stores (137), accounting for 6.9% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022; (ii) shop-in-shops (875), accounting for 9.0% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022; and (iii) multi-brand stores (4,490), accounting for 21.2% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022. We classify the mono-brand and shop-in-shop stores as the branded segment of our wholesale channel as our brands in those stores are clearly identifiable by the end-customers. The wholesale channel also includes e-tailers (e-commerce websites), omnichannel partners and pure players in e-commerce (approximately 1,122), accounting for 10.1% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2022. The wholesale channel enables us to increase customer reach while limiting distribution costs.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.7,Our Competitive Strengths,5.7.6,Flexible and robust industrial platform with control over entire value chain,"As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have ten in-house production facilities, differentiated by brand and product type, each of which focuses on the most critical and delicate processing phases to ensure the highest quality of our products. Specifically, we operate seven production facilities in Italy (two of which are located in Misinto (Milan), dedicated to B&B Italia and Fendi Casa, respectively), one in Valencia (Spain), one in Vejen (Denmark) and one in New York. Each facility is dedicated to a single brand’s production. As of June 30, 2023, our production facilities were supported by a network of approximately 1,950 carefully selected and diversified external suppliers located throughout the world and typically in close proximity to our inhouse production facilities, many of whom have been longstanding partners of ours. The following chart shows the composition of our suppliers by geographical area as of December 31, 2022: 136 ----- For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, approximately 44% of our production was carried out in house at our production facilities (typically relating to the most critical components of our products), while the remainder of our production (fabrication or assembly) was carried out through suppliers and partners outside the Group. This approach enables us to combine high levels of flexibility and scalability of production levels with the maintenance of high-quality standards and, coupled with our make-to-order driven footprint (with approximately 69% of our total production relating to make-to-order purchases for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023), allows us to have strong control over the entire value chain, from initial design of the product to supply and in-house production or outsourced production, as applicable, assembly of the finished product and transportation and logistics.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.7,Our Competitive Strengths,5.7.7,"Predictable revenues coupled with asset light, variable cost base and limited working capital requirements and strong cash flow generation","Our production is mainly focused on sales of made-to-order products, in particular that associated with our furniture, which represented approximately 69% of our total production for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, with the remainder being made-to-stock products. Our made-to-order sales typically have upfront payment terms, with approximately 30% to 50% of the final product price being paid by customers at the time of the order confirmation and the remaining approximately 70% to 50%, as applicable, being paid upon delivery. The significant contribution of our made-to-order sales to our total sales gives us visibility of our expected revenue streams in the short term (approximately eight weeks for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, providing revenue visibility of approximately two months for our made-to-order products). Where we do not operate on a made-to-order basis, we benefit from limited inventory risk given the long lifespan of our products. Our business, which is asset light by nature, also has a predominantly variable cost base. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that approximately 68% of our operating expenses was represented by variable costs. Our cash flow generation is in turn supported by low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Our net operating working capital was €69.9 million as of June 30, 2023 (representing 8.2% of our total revenues for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023), €46.9 million as of December 31, 2022 (representing 5.5% of our total revenues for such year), €3.3 million as of December 31, 2021 (representing 0.5% of our total revenues for such year) (exceptionally low mainly due to the acquisition of Lumens in 2021), and €33.9 million as of December 31, 2020 (representing 6.4% of our total revenues for such year), resulting in limited working capital requirements. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, capital expenditures represented only 4.7%, 4.6%, 5.1% and 4.3% of our total revenues for such periods, of which the majority represented discretionary growth capital expenditures. We have historically enjoyed strong cash flow generation through the economic cycle, including during the 20082010 global financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, supported by our high profitability levels and limited capital expenditure requirements. We have also historically recorded stable Adjusted EBITDA Margin and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we delivered consistently high Adjusted EBITDA Margins above 25% for each relevant period, despite the Emerging Brands having delivered lower margins than our Core Brands for these periods, mainly in light of the initial phase of their development. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, our Pro Forma Revenue was €426.5 million, €700.3 million and €867.6 million, respectively (in each case giving pro forma effect to the acquisition of Lumens, as regards 2021, and Audo, as regards 2022, as if we had acquired them on January 1 of the relevant year). The revenue of Flos for the year ended December 31, 2014, the year of its acquisition, was €159.2 million. For the same periods, our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was €102.2 million, €194.6 million and €219.3 million, respectively, and Pro Forma 137 ----- Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 24.0%, 27.2% and 25.3%, respectively. Our Free Cash Flow (calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period minus Maintenance Capital Expenditure for such period) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was €208.0 million, €206.6 million, €175.0 million and €133.2 million, resulting in Free Cash Flow Conversion (calculated as the ratio of Free Cash Flow for the relevant period to Adjusted EBITDA for such period) for each such period of 95.2%, 94.7%, 91.8% and 93.0%, respectively. We believe that our brand strength gives us strong pricing power, typically allowing us to pass the effects of increased raw material and component costs or adverse exchange rate fluctuations to our customers. Since our incorporation upon the joint acquisition by entities affiliated with Carlyle and Investindustrial of Flos, B&B Italia and Louis Poulsen in 2018, we have been able to reduce our net leverage from approximately 5.4x at the time of the acquisition (calculated at that time as the ratio of net financial indebtedness to (pre-IFRS 16) “Target Group Synergized EBITDA”) to 4.4x as of June 30, 2023 (calculated as the ratio of net financial indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this Offering Memorandum).",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

We aim to continue to attract up-and-coming international design talents and seek new collaborations with renowned stylists, fashion maisons and other players in the highend luxury industry to both develop new attractive and innovative products and reinforce the strength of our existing heritage designs, through for example the launch of new limited editions of our timeless iconic products. Our collaboration with English stylist Stella McCartney in 2023 for the development of B&B Italia’s Le Bambole x Stella McCartney is an example of how the close cooperation with top international brands in the high-end Luxury industry can reinforce the strength of our existing heritage designs. In addition, Louis Poulsen’s collaboration with talented emerging architect and designer Anne Boysen led to the production of the Moonsetter lamp, which was the winning design in the Next Danish Design Classic competition broadcast on national Danish television in 2020 and received the Lamp of the Year Award at the Design Awards in 2021. Another example of recent successful cooperation with a talented emerging designer is the Kompa Collection, designed by Botswanan Peter Mabeo for Fendi Casa, merging traditional African artisanship with luxury design. Going forward, we believe the enhancement of the desirability of our brands will also be increasingly dependent on our ability to deliver innovative products with a sustainability focus, including through eco-design, which considers environmental aspects at all stages of the product development process, in an effort to develop design solutions which make the lowest possible environmental impact throughout the product life cycle. For example, 138 ----- in 2023, we launched several eco-design projects, including Céramique, Emi, Bilboquet, Black Flag and Workmates for Flos, Eryt, Tortello Heri ‘O, Nooch and Cordoba Outdoor for B&B Italia, and Arclinea’s “g_cover” innovative new finishing, which is made with the recycled by-product from the manufacturing process of man-made graphite, enhancing the durability of Arclinea’s kitchens. We also intend to continue to support our younger brands through the various development phases and, in particular, we seek to accelerate the growth trajectory of our brands which are currently in their start-up phase, such Audo and Azucena, and development phase, such as Fendi Casa, Maxalto, Lumens and Arclinea, and to continue to develop new products. In order to continue to strengthen the desirability of our brands, we expect to continue to coordinate our marketing and advertising efforts through a single and pre-defined strategy for the Group, focusing on the creation of compelling contents, the prioritization of digital and social media for our advertisement campaigns and a deeper comprehension of our customers’ preferences and behaviors through dedicated CRM tools.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In particular, we aim to concentrate our focus on North America and Greater China, where we believe there is the greatest growth potential. As part of our strategy to expand in the United States, in 2021, we acquired Lumens, our U.S. based online platform which sells both products from our brands as well as third-party products. This acquisition materially boosted both e-commerce sales and sales in the Americas, which grew from €3.9 million and €74.9 million in 2020, respectively, to €103.7 million and €225.3 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. We believe the U.S. market is still underpenetrated and plan to continue to leverage on Lumens and our network of architects and designers to increase our sales in the region. Key growth initiatives in the United States will include: (i) expanding our architects and designers network through CRM and other digital tools and marketing events across brands; (ii) increasing the number of points of sales with a focus on space branding (mono-brand and shop-in-shop); (iii) selectively opening new stores in key locations with high growth potential, including New York, Miami and Boston; (iv) accelerating our contract channel expansion in the hospitality and retail space; and (v) optimizing the regional supply chain in our lighting business (both production and logistics). Moreover, the expansion in the Greater China region is one of our strategic priorities and, to that end, we have appointed a CEO Greater China at the Design Holding Level who oversees the commercial efforts in the region, including the opening of local stores, the roll-out of mono-brand stores with local partners and a digital-led marketing strategy to generate brand awareness and support distribution of products in the area. In 2022, we incorporated a new subsidiary in Shanghai, Design Holding (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., to facilitate our expansion in the region. We have the opportunity to establish our brands as pioneers in the region, especially in light of the still underdeveloped knowledge of the luxury design market among customers. Key growth initiatives in Greater China will include: (i) the creation of a Greater China Business Unit with its own sales and marketing teams and a dedicated e-commerce website; (ii) increasing wholesale distribution in key urban areas through mono-brand stores and shop-in-shops; (iii) selectively opening new stores (including via the B&B Italia Design Studio format) in key locations with high growth potential, such as Shanghai; and (iv) accelerating marketing activities and digital penetration through dedicated platforms.

Growth initiatives for our DOS channel will include (i) the selected roll out of B&B Italia, Fendi Casa and Flos / Louis Poulsen DOS in key cities with high growth potential; (ii) the enhancement of retail customer experience across our network through sales personnel excellence; and (iii) increased focus on our architects and designers network to drive qualified traffic into our DOS.

Key growth initiatives include: (i) improvement of the contract business capillarity by expanding the pipeline in specific regions (United States, China and the Middle East) and segments (residential, hospitality, retail and office for lighting); and (ii) increase synergies with other brands of the Group, increasing average project value and accelerating business generation by adding sister brands to projects and boosting cross-brand penetration on identified top accounts. We also plan to increase “soft” contract retail business opportunities within our DOS network by targeting retail customers and their specifiers in connection with smaller projects than the projects traditionally developed by our contract business. Soft contract projects may entail, for example, the supply of integrated furniture and lighting products to private individuals in connection with the construction or refurbishment of their homes or vacation houses. We believe the required cooperation with our customers in the development of these projects helps us build closer relationships with them.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.8,Our Strategies,5.8.5,Significant opportunity from new procurement cost saving initiatives under implementation,"One of our key operational priorities, along with maintaining and improving our high quality standards, is to continue the deployment of cost synergies from the creation of Design Holding and the further consolidation of our Group and coordination among our brands. In particular, we have identified a number of procurement optimization opportunities across both direct and indirect procurement categories, which we currently expect will deliver run-rate annual cost savings for an aggregate estimated amount of €17.8 million in the next three to four years, with approximately 43% of these savings estimated to be achieved by 2024 (€1.4 million in 2023 and €6.2 million in 2024) and the remainder in 2025 (€6.6 million) and 2026 (€3.6 million). We expect to incur one-off costs in order to achieve these cost savings of approximately €3 million between 2023 and the first half of 2024 related to the fees charged by the external consultant we have engaged in connection with the implementation of these procurement optimization initiatives. In the case of direct procurement, the identified initiatives relate to the procurement of semi-finished and finished products and raw materials. With respect to semi-finished and finished products, initiatives include the application of best-practice contracting methods and negotiations with suppliers, leveraging price transparency, should-cost analyses and win-win strategies, as well as improved visibility over prices applied by competing suppliers. With respect to raw materials, we intend to increase the competition among our suppliers (including by approaching competing suppliers and reviewing the existing supplier base) to obtain immediate or retroactive price decreases. We currently estimate that our cost savings and efficiency initiatives in the direct procurement category have the potential of delivering €9.4 million of run-rate annual cost savings in the next three to four years. In the case of indirect procurement, the identified initiatives relate to: (i) logistics and facility management, where we intend to call for tenders of regional logistics services with volume bundles over common routes, as well as renegotiate existing contractual arrangements; (ii) marketing and sales, where we intend to consolidate our expenditures by bundling our products into a single unit, apply demand management and leverage marketing benchmarks; (iii) professional services, where we intend to bundle demand, select preferred suppliers, review and renegotiate contracts and disable unused licenses; (iv) information technology and communication, where we intend to reduce costs by bundling hardware and software volumes, using benchmarks to increase supplier competition and renegotiating contracts; (v) packaging, where we intend to reduce costs by calling for tenders, leveraging value engineering and harmonizing specifications; and (vi) other indirect categories (e.g. R&D 140 ----- activities, mobility and travel, maintenance, repair and operations, etc.), where we intend to achieve cost savings by performing structured procurement activities, such as harmonization, bundling, benchmarking, standardization and negotiation. In addition, we launched the optimization of our insurance coverage by way of coordinated policy management and alignment of risk management across our brands. We currently estimate that our cost savings and efficiency initiatives in the indirect procurement category have the potential of delivering €8.4 million of run-rate annual cost savings in the next three to four years.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

We are open to considering and we constantly scrutinize additional strategic acquisitions, some of which could be significant in size, to add to our portfolio, capitalize on our competitive strengths, expand our geographic footprint and reach in jurisdictions, including outside of Europe, where we see potential growth opportunities and/or where we currently have limited operations, further diversify our product offering, preserve or improve our financial performance and/or benefit from further consolidation expected in the design industry. Any further potential acquisition opportunities will be evaluated in light of a prudent and rigorous analysis to preserve a solid financial position and high profitability. We will continue to apply a disciplined approach to pricing in connection with these potential acquisitions and will place significant emphasis on carefully planning and executing our acquisition strategy. As part of this strategy and to the extent possible, we will aim to use the investments we have already made in our IT, finance, operational, governance and business processes to reduce costs associated with on-boarding acquired businesses and will aim to utilize these synergies to benefit the entire Group.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.9,Our Business,5.9.1,,"We are a leading global design company in the high-end furniture and lighting markets. We design, produce, distribute and sell high-end lighting and furniture solutions. We offer our products through three core companies with leading positions in the global high-end design market: Flos, an Italian lighting brand; Louis Poulsen, a Danish lighting brand; and B&B, an Italian group with several brands in its portfolio (including B&B Italia, Maxalto, Azucena and Arclinea). Our core brands are complemented by three emerging brands with growing relevance in the global high-end lighting, accessories and furniture solutions markets: Lumens, a digital ecommerce platform of lighting, accessories and furniture in the United States; Fendi Casa, an Italian furniture, lighting and home accessories brand, based on a joint venture with the luxury brand Fendi; and Audo, a Danish furniture, lighting and accessories brand. Through these six complementary brands, we offer a broad range of product categories and brands across multiple sales channels and geographic areas. The management team that oversees and coordinates the operations of our brands is employed by Design Holding. From a governance perspective, since the formation of Design Holding in 2018 we underwent a major change, by transitioning from a founder-led to a management-led group. We believe that our holding operating model is a key contributor to our success as it enhances value creation through performance management and sharing of ideas, best practices and capabilities across our brands. Moreover, we have further strengthened our governance by coupling the governance teams at each of our brands with a centralized management team at the level of Design Holding (including Group CEO, Group CFO, Group Strategy, M&A and Business Development Director, Group Chief Digital Officer, Group Contract Director, Group Marketing and Sustainability Director, Group Human Resources and Organization Director, CEO Greater China at the Design Holding Level, Group General Counsel and Group E-Commerce Manager) in charge of overseeing the overall operations of the Group and coordinating with each operating company. In order to maximize our potential synergies in the Contract division, we have also set up a Contract committee, which meets monthly, coordinated by the Group Contract Director to discuss channel performance, industry opportunities, sharing projects and coordinate joint activities. From an operational perspective, we launched a centralized CRM platform, thus administering the interactions with customers in a more efficient way, leveraging the data gathered by our group companies. This initiative allows our Contract sales organizations at Flos, B&B Italia, Louis Poulsen and Arclinea to coordinate with each other and in the different geographical areas in which we operate. Moreover, the centralized CRM platform has enhanced the capability of the Group companies to connect with the architect community and end-consumers target segments. Additionally, we have also focused on establishing consistent cross-brand data governance, creating a digital centralized financial reporting tool for this purpose. 141 ----- We also launched several optimization projects to accelerate the work on cost synergies, starting from our procurement processes where, following an analysis with a specialised procurement consultant, we identified certain cost savings that we intend to implement in the coming years. Another example of our ongoing optimization projects is the optimization of our insurance coverage by way of coordinated policy management and alignment of risk management across our brands.

By bringing together and coordinating these six groups of companies and managing a total of nine brands to date, we have successfully created a one-stop shop for high-quality design furniture and lighting products for both individuals and businesses around the world. Design Holding, the direct parent company of the Issuer, provides the strategic direction necessary for the continued development of our business, while acting as a “center of excellence” across key capabilities. Through our coordinating activities, we set the vision and strategic direction of the Group and establish the necessary guidelines and coordination among our brands, in particular in the areas of finance, control, legal affairs, governance, human resources management, business strategy and digital strategies. We are also responsible for delivering specific guidance in the Wholesale, Contract, Directly Operated Stores (“DOS”) and Direct ECommerce sales channels, aimed at fostering the growth of our brands. We also facilitate the adoption of consistent group policies and operating processes, with a particular focus on ESG matters. One of our key goals is to ensure that our companies have a platform for developing industrial and commercial synergies, attracting talent in the design field, as well as highly qualified personnel in other areas, and improving brand awareness and growth through global omnichannel go-to-market policies. Our global brands have relationships with a broad base of leading designers who rely on our platform to develop high-end furniture and lighting products. These products are usable in a range of different environments and are distributed to consumers worldwide through a flexible and scalable industrial business model based on the following main four pillars. For more information see “—Business Model” below. As an aggregation platform, we also manage the Group’s merger and acquisition activity. Our platform enables our Core Brands to continue their growth and global expansion as well as to improve and consolidate their leadership in various markets.

Our brands provide designers with advanced research and development facilities that support their work by making available the most up-to-date technologies in the industry, enabling them to bring their designs to life. Owing in part to this commitment to research and development, we are able to attract and collaborate with established international designers with diverse professional experience and across different generations. We have collaborated with approximately 160 world-renowned designers. Some of our brands also collaborate with art directors, who work together with the designers to ensure unity of vision in branding and product catalog management. As of June 30, 2023, we employed approximately 127 employees dedicated to research and product development and, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, allocated a total amount of about 1% of our sales in such period to research and product development. In 2022, we launched more than 90 new product families (including extensions of existing product lines and special editions). In general, we structure our product lines as follows: (i) iconic products constantly present in our offering (such as the Arco lamp by Flos or the UP5_6 armchair by B&B Italia); (ii) products based entirely on new designs or on historical designs not previously commercialized; (iii) modernization and sale of existing products in order to reflect new technical specifications, such as updating certain designs that are part of our heritage for the implementation of new LED technology; (iv) relaunch of products that were already part of our offerings (such as (i) B&B Italia’s Camaleonda sofa, which was first launched on the market in 1970 and subsequently re-released in 2020, positioning itself as one of our best-selling sofas and an iconic hero product in social media in the year following its launch, and (ii) “Le Bambole” Collection, first launched in 1970 and new “Le Bambole” collection re-released in 2022 with circularity in mind and designed to be fully disassembled); and (v) limited edition products (such as the Arco K lamp by Flos, of which only 2,022 pieces were made available for sale). _In-house Manufacturing and Established Manufacturing Partnerships_ With the exception of Lumens (which does not operate a production facility), as of June 30, 2023, we had ten inhouse production facilities, differentiated by brand and product type, each of which focuses on the most critical and delicate processing phases of their respective products to ensure the highest quality of our products. Our inhouse production facilities include seven in Italy (two of which in the same location in Misinto (Milan)), one in Valencia (Spain), one in Vejen (Denmark) and one in New York. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, approximately 56% of our production capacity was carried out through the operation (fabrication or assembly) of suppliers and partners outside of the Group, while the remaining approximately 44% was carried out in house and typically relates to the most critical components of our products. Our production is mainly focused on sales of made-to-order products, which represented approximately 69% of total revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, with the remainder being made-to-stock products. As of December 31, 2022, our facilities were supported by a network of approximately 1,950 carefully selected external suppliers located throughout the world and generally in close proximity to our production facilities. As part of our ongoing effort to secure partnerships with high quality suppliers, we are requiring all of our suppliers 143 ----- to adhere to our supplier code of ethics, which grants us audit rights as well as supply agreement termination rights in the event of any breaches by the supplier. The following chart shows the composition of our suppliers by geographical area as of December 31, 2022: By utilizing a wide network of suppliers, we can combine high flexibility and scalability of production levels with the maintenance of high-quality standards. _Marketing Channels Fostering Brand Recognition in the Market_ Each of our brands also benefits from a strong digital channel and social media presence, which supports brand awareness across all of our distribution channels and facilitates earlier customer acquisition, as compared to more traditional sales channels. Our brands have enhanced their presence on social media in recent years, with large fan bases and followers across all the main platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest and X (Twitter). Through sophisticated marketing tools across various media and channels, we aim to expand the recognition of our brands on the market, enhancing their value and increasing customer engagement across various touch points. Our integrated marketing approach is implemented through (i) digital communication tools and publications in the main international media, (ii) events such as the Milan Design Week (Salone del Mobile) and other prestigious international events in the design field, (iii) sophisticated branded publications and magazines supporting sales and dealers, (iv) tools enhancing consumers’ experience in stores, (v) social media and key opinion leader engagement and (vi) visibility resulting from specific projects that are commissioned to us, including, among others, B&B Italia Bulgari Hotel and Resorts in Tokyo, Paris and Rome, M+ Museum in Hong Kong, La Bella Vita in Taichung, Taiwan, One Thousand Museum Residences in Miami and The Whiteley in London. We constantly strive to integrate the above-mentioned channels in order to efficiently bring to the final consumer a consistent brand image capable of expressing the values and correct market positioning of our brands. _Omnichannel Distribution Structure_ Our omnichannel approach comprises four key sales channels: 1. _Direct-to-customer. Our direct-to-customer channels allow us to directly reach our end-customers with a flexible, tailor-made and cost-efficient approach adapted to a rapidly evolving market, and comprise: - _Contract.

Our DOS channel comprises retail stores that sell only products from our brands, either individually by brand or in a combination with products from our other brands. An example is our new DOS in Boston, Massachusetts, which sells products from our B&B Italia, Maxalto and Arclinea brands. In the past year, we have accelerated our openings of DOS, mono-brand and shop-in-shop spaces, with 61 new openings during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. The DOS channel includes 19 stores managed directly by our companies and represented 6.7% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. 2. _Wholesale. Our wholesale channel includes over 5,521 brick-and-mortar points of sale throughout the world, in various different formats managed by third parties, with a special focus on (i) mono-brand stores (137), managed by third parties and accounting for 8.1% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; (ii) shop-in-shops (875), accounting for 8.7% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; and (iii) multibrand stores (4,490), accounting for 23.3% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. The wholesale channel also includes e-tailers (e-commerce websites), omnichannel partners and pure player e-commerce businesses (1,122 and accounting for 10.8% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023).

The Decorative division forms the core of Flos’ product offering and is managed by Flos S.p.A. primarily from the company’s headquarters in Brescia. The production of Decorative products is mainly outsourced to a selected number of trusted manufacturers, primarily in Italy, and quality control activities are carried out internally. The Decorative division product offering is broad and consists of more than 2,100 different products (including different configurations of the same product and excluding spare parts). _Architectural_ Flos’ Architectural division was established in 1996 in response to growing demand for high-profile commercial lighting products and is managed by Flos’ subsidiary Antares in Valencia, Spain. The Architectural division provides lighting products primarily for sophisticated, high-end commercial applications including retail stores, hotels, offices and luxury residential properties. Approximately 10% to 20% of Flos’ Architectural products are assembled at the Antares plant in Valencia. The Architectural division product offering is also broad and includes approximately 7,800 products (including different configurations of the same product and excluding spare parts). _Outdoor_ Following the acquisition of Italian outdoor lighting producer Ares in 2015, Flos began incorporating Ares products into its catalogue, resulting in the launch of the first Flos Outdoor collection in 2017. In 2022, Flos fully consolidated the Ares product catalogue into the Flos Outdoor catalogue. Production of Flos Outdoor is managed directly by Ares and takes place entirely in Bernareggio, in northern Italy. The Outdoor collection is designed for open spaces and aims to strike a balance between complementing the existing architecture and blending into the landscape. The Outdoor division comprises approximately 3,800 products (including different configurations of the same product and excluding spare parts). _Custom_ The Custom division delivers custom-made lighting products for commercial and residential applications and is mainly managed by the Flos subsidiary Flos Bespoke S.r.l.

The creation of a Flos product is the culmination of an integrated process involving designers, architects and the company’s in-house research and development department, with full-time employees dedicated to such activity. As of June 30, 2023, Flos’ research and development division had 50 full-time employees. Designs begin at the concept stage, in which designers either propose their own ideas for designs or produce concepts for designs based on Flos’ instructions and request. The concept stage is followed by a period of research, in which designs are further developed and modelled, materials are selected, and products undergo initial engineering. During the refining stage, the product is developed as a prototype and undergoes a second round of engineering and analysis against safety standards. The product then moves to the defining stage, in which final engineering takes place, the product is measured against internal and external quality standards and arrangements are made for production logistics and the supply of raw materials. Finally, the product moves to the production stage, which encompasses the procurement of raw materials, production planning and the final manufacturing of the product. During this stage, agreements for production logistics and sourcing of raw materials are made. Flos benefits from of a vast archive of designs by distinguished Italian designers dating back to the 1950s that has never been commercialized, which we believe represents an important growth opportunity for Flos. 147 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Due to the complexity of the techniques and materials required for the manufacture of Flos’ products, production is mostly outsourced to carefully selected manufacturers, with a majority of production on the basis of make-to-order and make-to-stock principles. Within the Decorative and Architectural divisions, manufacturing is primarily outsourced, and assembly is almost entirely outsourced. Production levels of Decorative products are based on a forecast of sales volumes at stock keeping unit (“SKU”) level which is normally made on a yearly basis, but such forecast is then adjusted on a monthly basis throughout the year based on actual demand with a very short lead time, as Decorative products (as well as certain readily available Architectural products) can generally have short delivery timeframes. In the Architectural, Outdoor and Custom divisions, production is done on order; within the Outdoor division, manufacturing is entirely internal and assembly is almost entirely internal, with production taking place to order.

Prior to being sent to assemblers, raw materials and product components undergo an initial round of quality control, during which Flos (or the third-party assembler, in the case of products assembled outside of Italy) utilizes specialized quality control software to run quality controls on a statistical basis, the frequency of which varies depending on the specific type of material or component. The raw materials and components are then either assembled internally or packaged into assembly kits and sent to third-party assemblers. Flos generally contracts with assemblers that are located in close proximity to its headquarters in Bovezzo and members of its internal quality control organization make regular visits to assemblers to gauge the assemblers’ quality control procedures. During the assembly phase (both internal at Flos and external at the third-party assembler), quality controls are performed on every product and the outcome of each quality control test is collected by Flos through its quality control software. Assembled products are then returned to Flos, where products undergo a further quality control assessment on a statistical basis to ensure that they meet internal and external standards of quality and safety, while adhering to the original design principles, before being stored in Flos’ warehouses and shipped to customers as required. In addition, the first production run of new products is always assembled internally, so that Flos can then share best practices with its external assemblers. Flos contracts with a diverse group of mainly non-exclusive suppliers to provide the raw materials, assembly and finished products it requires. Suppliers are carefully selected mainly according to their technical capacity, quality, finance reliability and cost and are usually located in close proximity to Flos’ facilities to minimize transportation costs and timing. Flos group contracted with approximately 500 suppliers in 2022. The relationships between Flos and its suppliers are governed mainly through (i) purchase orders with general terms and conditions specifying the purchase process, the general terms of delivery of purchased materials, the terms of invoicing and certain general obligations of the suppliers; (ii) standard supply agreements or (iii) framework supply agreements specifying terms, termination rights and minimum quantities. Flos also requires its suppliers to adhere to a set of guidelines provided by the company concerning the quality and any technical requirements of the products. If materials or products are found to be defective, Flos can return them to the supplier to be replaced or repaired at the expense of the supplier.

These agreements can be divided into two broad categories: (i) intellectual property transfer agreements providing for the complete assignment of intellectual property rights from the designer to Flos, which represents the majority of agreements between Flos and designers, and (ii) license agreements with Flos as licensee, which comprise a limited amount of agreements relative to intellectual property transfer agreements. Most of the transfer agreements grant to Flos all of the rights arising from any potential future versions of products that could be developed by the relevant designer without need to enter into further agreements and expressly grant Flos registration rights with respect to the designs.

These agreements typically do not include exclusivity clauses, although _de facto exclusive relationships have been created following several years of collaboration.

Flos was founded in Merano, in northern Italy, in 1962 by Arturo Eisenkeil and Dino Gavina, in partnership with the Cassina family. In 1962, Flos introduced the Arco lamp, which became one of its most iconic and best-selling lamp designs. Flos transferred its headquarters to Brescia, in northern Italy, in 1964, opened its first store in Milan in 1968 and embarked upon its international expansion in 1971, with the opening of its first foreign branch in Germany. In 1974, Flos acquired the heritage Italian lighting brand Arteluce, significantly expanding its product range and international reach. Flos began its exclusive collaboration with Philippe Starck in the 1980s, and throughout the 1990s, Flos unified its divisions into a unique brand catalogue and continued its global expansion into North America and Asia. The contract business was first introduced in 1996, in response to growing demand from commercial customers. In the early 2000s, following its participation in the first International Light & Building fair, Flos launched its architectural business, Flos Architectural, which represented its first venture into lighting for commercial spaces, which later expanded to cover residential spaces. The Architectural business was significantly bolstered with the acquisition in 2005 of a majority stake in Antares, a Spanish commercial lighting producer based in Valencia, Spain. In 2016, 2020 and 2022, Flos received its fourth, fifth and sixth Compasso d’Oro awards for the lamps “OK” by Konstantin Grcic, “Arrangements” by Michael Anastassiades, and “Belt” by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, respectively. In addition, in 2020, Flos received also the first Compasso d’Oro Product Lifetime Achievement Award for the “Arco” lamp. Entities affiliated with Investindustrial acquired a majority stake in Flos in 2014. In 2016, Flos acquired the New York City-based custom lighting producer Lukas Lighting, further strengthening the company’s presence in the custom sector, and Italian outdoor lighting company Ares, which allowed Flos to expand into outdoor lighting. In 2017, Flos began a rebranding of a portion of the Ares catalogue, introducing its first “Flos Outdoor” collection, and acquired Flos Projets (formerly KKDC S.à r.l.), a French distributor of LED lighting products, supporting its distribution capacity in the area. In 2018, entities affiliated with Investindustrial and The Carlyle Group acquired Flos (along with Louis Poulsen and B&B) with the goal of creating a global high-end design group that brings together a collection of renowned and complementary brands. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, Flos generated revenues from contracts with customers of €258.8 million (30.4% of the Group’s revenues from contracts with customers) and €267.1 million (31.6% of the Group’s revenues from contracts with customers).",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Although Louis Poulsen primarily depends on its own directly-employed sales consultants, in certain markets third-party agents or distributors are considered more customary or efficient, based on the features and the commercial practices of each market. For example, in the U.S., while Louis Poulsen uses its own directly-employed sales consultants for sales of decorative and architectural lighting in the contract channel, it relies on a distributor to sell post lighting in certain contract channels. In addition, in the wholesale sector, Louis Poulsen has increased its presence through online resellers, such as Lumens, Royal Design, Design Within Reach, Iabelfarm GmbH, Connox GmbH and nest.co.uk. In addition, Louis Poulsen has enhanced its e-commerce in Denmark and expanded its online services also to Sweden, Norway and Germany.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.14,Louis Poulsen,5.14.2,Design,"Louis Poulsen’s distinct design philosophy originates from Poul Henningsen’s ambition to give electrical light similar ambient properties as the candlelight it replaced in the early 20[th ]century. With that goal in mind, Louis Poulsen has always sought not to design lamps, but to shape light. The company’s philosophy, “Design to Shape 150 ----- Light”, represents the duality between design and light, where every detail of the product has its own purpose. On the basis of the design principles dictated by Poul Henningsen, light must always be indirect, diffused and easy on the eyes and every single detail of the product design must have its own purpose. Louis Poulsen designs have been awarded numerous prestigious design awards, including the 2018 IF Gold Award for the Yuh lamp by GamFratesi, the Danish Design Award, Dansk Industri og Danish Design Center award, the Lighting Design Award, Revo Media award and the Design Award, Bo Bedre for the Flindt wall and several other Danish Bo Bedre Design Awards for Lamp of the Year, for the Patera lamp by Øivind Slaatto, and the Wallpaper* Design Awards 2022 for the Moonsetter lamp by Anne Boysen, among others, and are collected by design museums around the world, including the Danish Design Museum. Louis Poulsen’s design philosophy is strongly rooted in Danish design heritage. Since its first collaboration with Poul Henningsen in 1924, Louis Poulsen has expanded its influence through partnerships with the most celebrated designers in Danish design history, eventually acquiring intellectual property rights to some of the most famous lighting designs of the “big 5” Danish industrial designers: Poul Henningsen, Vilhelm Lauritzen, Arne Jacobsen, Finn Juhl and Verner Panton, which remain at the core of Louis Poulsen’s offering. See “—Agreements with _Designers” for information on Louis Poulsen’s contractual arrangements with its designers. Whether recently_ developed or part of the core collection, all of the Louis Poulsen designs incorporate the company’s philosophy of “Design to Shape Light” and the simple, timeless expression that is core to Danish design. Louis Poulsen has an archive of more than 1,000 patterns and designs from designers, including Poul Henningsen, Arne Jacobsen and Finn Juhl, which have never been commercialized, which we believe represents an important growth opportunity for Louis Poulsen.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.14,Louis Poulsen,5.14.3,Production,"Louis Poulsen utilizes a highly scalable operating model, based on an institutionalized, commercially-driven design process, a well-invested production setup with an increasing share of outsourcing and a majority of sales activities conducted through its own global salesforce. _Production cycle_ Louis Poulsen’s production follows a cycle revolving around two main product launch phases, Spring (February to April) and Fall (September and October), during which new products are formally marketed and sold to end-customers. Each market launch phase is preceded by a corresponding internal preparation phase (November to January and May to June), during which the salesforce deploys marketing content to wholesalers and sells them new products internally, the supply chain is engaged based on demand estimates and the production lines are prepared accordingly and extended, to the extent required. On the sales side, prior to launch, new products are previewed with new and existing customers, who provide feedback to the marketing team to further refine demand estimates, and sales teams are brought in-house to refresh their general sales training and receive specialized training on new products. In the Contracts channel, production of custom products is initiated in collaboration with the architects and designers acting as specifiers on the relevant project. In the wholesale channel, immediately prior to launch, the sales teams communicate details of the new products to external customers and use social media and other marketing channels to generate interest around the products. During the official launch phase, the marketing team prepares content for the launch, while the new products are distributed to customers and subsidiaries and customer service and technical specifications are prepared. Louis Poulsen’s production is mainly conducted in-house at the company’s production facility located in Vejen, Denmark, where it employs approximately 136 full-time and part-time employees, and which includes mechanical workshops, painting areas and assembly areas. In the assembly area, the products are also tested and packaged to be transported to Louis Poulsen’s warehouses, which have implemented a third-party logistics setup, and stored with components and products originating from third-party suppliers. _Supply Chain Management_ Louis Poulsen primarily sources raw materials and components that it does not have the capacity or volume to produce internally, such as cast aluminum, polycarbonate items, mouth-blown glass and electrical drivers. A small number of Louis Poulsen suppliers are considered key to its operations due to their expertise and ability in manufacturing sophisticated high-end materials, such as mouth blown glass. Whilst maintaining low input prices is important to Louis Poulsen, a few of the raw materials used, such as steel, copper and plastic, may be subject to global price volatility. Louis Poulsen does not normally hedge against this risk and believes it continues to be in the position to mitigate this risk as it has historically been able to pass any 151 ----- such price increases onto customers or has used different third-party suppliers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related _to our Business—If prices of the raw materials we employ in our manufacturing processes or of the components or finished products we purchase were to increase, our business could be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to pass any such price increases on to our customers”. Quality Controls_ Louis Poulsen maintains a high standard of quality control throughout the manufacturing process, with a dedicated internal quality department that inspects raw materials, components and products at all stages of manufacturing and assembly to ensure compliance with the expected quality standards. In addition, Louis Poulsen employs a dedicated quality control manager to inspect and monitor the quality of products produced by its production partners in China. In order to ensure the compliance to the high product quality standards, Louis Poulsen also conducts a thorough quality assessment at third-party retail locations involved in distribution. This assessment evaluates the brand’s position, product assortment, and the level of service provided. _Distribution_ Louis Poulsen manufactures its products primarily internally, at the company’s plant in Vejen, Denmark. European sales are managed principally from the warehouse located in Vejen, which also supports the exports to Africa, the Middle East and South America. In addition to the main warehouse in Vejen, Louis Poulsen operates three additional distribution centers in the United States, Japan and Singapore to support global sales. The regional distribution centers ship products directly to retailers and architectural projects, ensuring high responsiveness and short delivery lead times. The warehouse in the United States supports North and Central America and Canada, the warehouse in Japan supports the surrounding region and the Singapore warehouse supports the rest of the APAC region, including Korea. In addition, Louis Poulsen launched a new “shop-in-shop” concept in 2016, through which it provides resellers with an easy-to-build branded structure with specific sizes and features, so as to increase visibility of the Louis Poulsen brand in stores. Louis Poulsen is working on a new customer virtual experience, which will be implemented in its shop-in-shops and rolled out over the coming years. Louis Poulsen has implemented a “dual pricing” system as a new way of balancing and differentiating its discounts to wholesalers. This differentiates the discount given to pure e-retail wholesalers compared to wholesalers with physical stores where customers can experience the products. Further, we have implemented a Tier 1 dealership, where certain products are exclusively available to a limited range of existing dealers under additional requirements to support the high-end exclusivity of the brand.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Louis Poulsen’s license agreements generally grant Louis Poulsen the exclusive, non-revocable worldwide right to commercially exploit certain specified lighting designs in exchange for royalties paid to the designer or the designer’s legal representatives, generally providing for payment on a quarterly or annual basis per unit sold. These royalties are alternatively based on a percentage of the proceeds from net sales of the product designed or on a fixed fee per designed product. In general, licenses are granted for the duration of the validity of the copyright of the design, which extends for 70 years after the death of the designer. The first of such licenses to expire will do so in 2037. After the relevant expiry date, Louis Poulsen will still be able to produce and sell the designs of such designers, but without exclusivity. In addition, Louis Poulsen relies to a more limited extent on license agreements with other designers to complement its heritage collection that have different terms. Although these license agreements do not have set termination dates, most grant the designers the right to terminate the agreement should certain minimum sales rates fail to be met over a specified period, or should Louis Poulsen significantly reduce or cease production of certain products. Furthermore, license agreements can generally be terminated by the designers or their legal representatives in the case of material breach, for instance if royalties are not paid when due and following notice from the licensor.

Menu and ByLassen designed, manufactured and distributed furniture, lighting, and accessories with a Nordic style and The Audo is a hybrid of a café, a restaurant, a small boutique hotel and a retail store in Copenhagen, Denmark. At the time of our acquisition, Menu was the group’s main operating company, which was responsible for the design, development and sale of design products, distributed to end users worldwide through resellers, including online distributors. Menu’s headquarters were located at The Audo. The café at The Audo and the restaurant were managed and owned by third parties, while the hotel and retail unit was self-operated and owned. In June 2023, Menu, by Lassen and The Audo merged into the new brand “Audo” with the aim of enhancing the Nordic-style design archives owned by Designers Company. The company is headquartered in Nordhavn, Copenhagen, Denmark, and also has a presence in the United States. Designers Company was founded in 1978 by the Hansen family under the name “Menu”, with a focus on the production and distribution of home accessories. Beginning in 2013, the group repositioned itself in the market by phasing out most of its low-price home accessories from its product portfolio and adding a wide range of furniture, objects and lighting products inspired by Nordic design. Starting in 2018, the group further expanded its offerings and acquired a U.S. distribution company to broaden its market presence. In 2021, Designers Company acquired “by Lassen”, a historic brand founded by the Lassen brothers, which also owned the rights to certain historic designs and iconic products. The brand was based on the legacy of designers Mogens Lassen and Flemming Lassen, dating back to the 1930s. Designs by Morgens Lassen and Flemming Lassen, which are archived at the Royal Art Library in Søborg, were reworked and relaunched as part of the by Lassen catalogue. Products under the by Lassen brand were characterized by a focus on producing and designing furniture and accessories that are of high quality, and therefore more sustainable.

Compliance with local, national and international laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other regulated activities has had and will continue to have an impact on our operations, but has to date been accomplished without having a material adverse effect on our operations. We have trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements. Our goal is to reduce and, whenever possible eliminate the creation of hazardous waste in our manufacturing processes. While it is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate costs to be incurred for the achievement of such goal due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations and technology, based on information currently known to management, we do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, competitive position or cash flows.

Specifically, when entering a new market or introducing a new product to an existing market, the product shall comply with the requirements of the applicable laws and regulations. Such requirements vary depending on the specific geographical area and may include a manufacturer’s so called “Declaration of Conformity” (e.g., in the EU) or a mandatory certification from the relevant authority (e.g., in China). Depending on the country of operations, the process may take from two weeks to several months. As part of the approval process, a change of the product to comply with the requirements could be necessary; furthermore, the relevant authority might ask for certain minor changes to the specifications of the product. Historically, however, we have not experienced any material issues or delays in connection with obtaining regulatory approval for our products. In 2018, the U.S. introduced certain bans on formaldehyde-releasing agents which are often found in, among other things, resins used in the manufacture of composite wood products, glues, paints, coatings and lacquers. As a result of these new rules, B&B adjusted its manufacturing processes to ensure that no such agents were contained in its products, thus demonstrating its ability to promptly adapt its manufacturing standards and processes to the highest industry standards required by the laws of the countries in which it operates, as these may change from time to time. Although this change did not result in any material cost increases, there can be no assurance that future changes in environmental, product safety or other regulations would not result in material increases in raw material costs or delays in production.

Sustainability is key to our business and our brands are committed to being recognized as leaders in adopting sustainable policies and practices and in developing a new concept of luxury high-end design that has sustainability at its core. As a result of this commitment, in 2020, the same year in which Flos and B&B published certain ESG targets, among which an emission reduction target aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”), Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen achieved carbon neutrality in scopes 1 and 2 of greenhouse gas emissions, as set by the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Our focus on ESG continued to be evident in 2021 through the achievement of carbon neutrality in our own operations; Flos’ industrial plants obtaining the ISO 14001:2015 standard; and start of Louis Poulsen’s buy-back program of lamps discarded by customers. In 2022, the Group extended its efforts and achievements in sustainability by joining the UN Global Compact and achieving carbon neutrality in scopes 1 and 2 of greenhouse gas emissions. B&B Italia also implemented various sustainability-focused initiatives, such as the reuse of 100% of the scraps of polyurethane of the Novedrate’s production line for the production of cushions for the Nooch outdoor sofa. More recently, we extended the reporting perimeter of our SBTi scope 3 emissions, decreased the emission intensity compared to previous years, used renewable sources of energy for 78% of the electricity that we consumed and launched various new ecodesign projects. In addition to our sustainability efforts, our commitment to forward-thinking social and governance policies in the Group has led to 97% of our employees having permanent employment contract. We promote transversal committees that enable an innovative style of governance and foster dialogue by sharing information, projects, competences and best practices. With our international presence and shared values, the Group reflects the diversity of our employees. The variety of talents drives our competitiveness, our ability to innovate and our attractiveness. Our efforts toward a gender-balanced workforce have also led to 45% of our employees being women. Another example of our ongoing commitment to ESG efforts is evidenced by an increase of 20% in training hours delivered compared to 2021. Our commitment to sustainability is founded on the following three principles: - _Design for Planet. Through this pillar, we promote eco-design principles in all of our operations, establish and encourage our manufacturers to align their behavior with best practices and focus on the craftsmanship quality of the product and create more sustainable and eco-circular products. In addition, we are committed to contributing toward the fight against climate change. Our eco-design principles are 167 ----- embedded in our brands, such as Louis Poulsen, which has implemented a policy of reusing components of discontinued lamps to minimize waste. Similarly, certain B&B Italia products may be fully dissembled in order to reuse individual components (for example, the components of the Borea collection can be reused for more than 60%, or the “le Bambole” collection, which can be fully disassembled and more than 80% of the components can be reused), and Flos facilitates circularity by offering models made of innovative materials from industrial waste, such as Almendra and Skynest; - _Design for People. We promote a better quality of life, with a common focus on principles of creativity, quality and respect. Moreover, designers who are established at the worldwide level, as well as important workshops, work in close contact with our brands, creating synergies within a work environment that is characterized by equity, diversity and inclusiveness to allow each individual to express his or her full potential. Creating a thriving, inclusive and fair working environment is essential and among our key priorities. Within the framework of our sustainability plan, we set and monitor specific ESG targets on diversity and inclusion and people empowerment, to ensure that these principles and rights can be upheld at every level of our operations. As a result, we intend to hire new employees with different nationalities or backgrounds to increase both the diversity within our brands as well as continue to develop a true feeling of inclusion and belonging. - _Design for Culture. We seek to nurture our brands’ identities by preserving the craftsmanship, design heritage and quality of their products. Through an increasingly sustainable approach, we also aim to promote the historical value intrinsic in our brands’ most iconic design pieces, thus guaranteeing their longevity and durability. Our brands work toward driving innovation and research, further strengthening relationships with their community and promoting a culture of design. Under this principle, three Brands’ Academies (relating to Flos, B&B Italia and Louis Poulsen) have been developed as an instrument for accelerating hard skills development, craftsmanship and design mindset. In addition, Lumens launched the “Innovators Council”, featuring prominent figures in the design industry, selected for their unique perspective and experiences and with the goal of inspiring and educating trade and consumer audiences. We also generate value to communities around the world as a proactive actor in the communities in which we take part through the establishment of partnerships that create long-term social value, including, for example, partnerships with universities and trade schools. As an example, in 2022, Arclinea funded a three-year scholarship with University of Venice, Italy, for a PhD research program within the department of Design. Similarly, Flos has also established a new partnership with the “Fundación Universitat Jaume I”, offering extracurricular training programs to students of the university. 168 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,646,B&B,646.20,,646.20.1,,"B&B is one of the world’s leading producers of high-end designer furniture for residential and commercial use. B&B was founded in 1966 by Pier Ambrogio Busnelli and Cesare Cassina and the first factory began production in 1968. Originally called C&B (Cassina & Busnelli), the company was renamed B&B Italia S.p.A. in 1973 following Mr. Busnelli’s acquisition of Mr. Cassina’s shares. The first B&B point of sale was opened in New York in 1976. B&B has distinguished itself since its founding with its innovative industrial approach to manufacturing, in contrast to the small, traditional artisan competitors that were typical of the home furnishings sector at the time. For example, in 1968, B&B became the first company to apply polyurethane extrusions to a 153 ----- metal skeleton in a mold, allowing for the production of shapes and for consistency of quality that would not be achievable with traditional production methods, and B&B’s iconic Coronado sofa became the first ever sofa produced using this method in the same year. Based in Novedrate in northern Italy, B&B operates from a headquarters designed in 1972 by the world-renowned architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers. B&B’s products have made a rich contribution to the history of Italian design, with styles that represent the union of creativity, innovation and industrial expertise. This approach has garnered B&B numerous international design accolades, including five Compasso d’Oro prizes, the most prestigious industrial design award in Italy, won in 1979 for Le Bambole by M. Bellini; in 1984 for Sisamo by Studio Kairos; in 1987 for Sity by A. Citterio; in 1989 when B&B became the first company to win the Compasso d’Oro in its own right, rather than for one of its products; and in 2022 for the SERIE UP by G. Pesce. In 2022, B&B also won the 2022 Wallpaper* Design Award for the Best Dining Experience. Entities affiliated with Investindustrial acquired 80% of B&B from the Busnelli family in 2015, and in 2016 B&B acquired a controlling stake in the Italian high-end kitchen design firm Arclinea (currently wholly-owned), creating a partnership that combined B&B’s innovative and design-led approach to home furnishings with Arclinea’s established pedigree in creating modern kitchens that are both functional and elegant. B&B has been part of the Design Holding family since we were originally founded in 2018. B&B continues to innovate in production and manufacturing techniques and in 2016 became the first company in Italy to install the “Versalis offline” unit, a completely automatic system for cutting leather. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, B&B generated revenues from contracts with customers of €298.2 million (35.0% of the Group’s revenues from contracts with customers) and €284.0 million (33.6% of the Group’s revenues from contracts with customers), respectively. In recognition of its flagship status in the Italian design community, B&B was chosen as the founding member of the “Altagamma” organization, an association of prominent Italian luxury producers considered leaders in their fields and ambassadors for Italian culture and style throughout the world.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including asset sales, equity sales, acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “— _Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”, “—Certain Covenants—Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens on Intellectual Property”. Such_ restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. 219 ----- Future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders or investors to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings or securities that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings or securities, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of any of the events that constitute a Change of Control would trigger a change of control under the Existing Indenture. Moreover, the occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Additionally, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Moreover, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required purchases. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to purchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related _to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The term “all or substantially all in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning under relevant laws and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of control has occurred or will occur”. In addition, the definition of_ “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control”, may be waived or modified at any time (including after a Change of Control) with the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of any Indebtedness Incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, if Incurred or issued in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period”. Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Cash Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sales by a Subsidiary (x) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to Italy, Denmark or Spain or (y) would have a material adverse tax consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or other net benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation that would not otherwise be realized), as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Subsidiary; _provided that clause (x) of this paragraph shall apply to such amounts so long, but only so long, as the applicable_ local law will not permit repatriation to Italy, Denmark or Spain (the Issuer hereby agreeing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Subsidiary to take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation to Italy, Denmark or Spain), and if such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law and is not subject to clause (y) of this paragraph, then, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds will be applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) in compliance with this covenant. The time periods set forth in this covenant shall not start until such time as the Net Cash Proceeds may be repatriated to Italy, Denmark or Spain (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs). Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest or utilize such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that any amount of Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale that is not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of proceeds offered to holders pursuant to clause (1)(c) or clause (2) of the second paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer made at any time after the Asset Sale shall be deemed to have been applied as required and shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to the extent to which such 239 ----- offer is accepted by the holders. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds less Total Leverage Excess Proceeds (as defined below), if any, exceeds €20 million, the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds less Total Leverage Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to (but not including) the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. However, the Issuer shall only be required to make an Asset Sale Offer with 50% of the Excess Proceeds if the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio for the Issuer is less than or equal to the Specified Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio after giving effect to any application of any Net Cash Proceeds as set forth herein, including completion of any prior offer to repurchase a portion of the Notes (any Excess Proceeds not required to be offered in an Asset Sale Offer in reliance on this sentence (i.e., such 50%) shall constitute “Total Leverage Excess Proceeds”). The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that such Excess Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds exceed €20 million by transmitting electronically or by mailing to the holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds at any time prior to the expiration of the application period or by electing to make an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds before the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds exceeds €20 million. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds is less than the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Trustee shall select the Notes (and the Issuer or its agents shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness) to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent the Excess Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (and, if required by the terms thereof, all Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuer needs only make an Asset Sale Offer up to the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes (and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness), and any additional Excess Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds shall not be subject to this covenant and shall be permitted to be used for any purpose in the Issuer’s discretion. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer or one of its Affiliates could seek the consent of its lenders or investors to the purchase of the Notes or attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer or one of its Affiliates do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, they will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If more Notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuer is required to purchase, selection of such Notes for purchase will be made in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed (so long as the Trustee knows of such listing) or if such Notes are not listed, on a _pro rata_ basis based on the total amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer (with adjustments so that only Notes in denominations of the minimum 240 ----- denomination of €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof shall be purchased) by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements and, in the case of Global Notes, the procedures of the Depository); provided that the selection of Notes for purchase shall not result in a holder with a principal amount of Notes less than the minimum denomination of €100,000. No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the minimum denomination of such Note would be left outstanding. Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or sent electronically, at least ten days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC procedures, as applicable. If any Note is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any Note (other than a global note) purchased in part will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the Note. On and after the purchase date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof purchased.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements as discussed in “Transfer _restrictions”._ Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”. Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Restricted Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions”, and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest. In the event additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the initial Notes, without being fungible with such initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such additional Notes) will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any). Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book- Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes of such series of Notes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees _and the Collateral—Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes” and “Description of Notes—General”._ Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. 308 ----- The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the LuxSE and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time. Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests. In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law. To the extent permitted by law, each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; _provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral multiples of_ €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if such Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer and the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee and authenticating agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the 309 ----- Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.

None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, nor any of their respective agents, are responsible for those operations or procedures. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations.

Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets in several countries.

Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest relating to Notes issued by the Issuer that qualify as obbligazioni or titoli similari alle obbligazioni are subject to a tax, referred to as imposta sostitutiva (as defined below), levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or when payment thereof is obtained by the holder on a sale of the Notes) where an Italian resident holder of Notes is the beneficial owner of such Notes, and is: (a) an individual holding Notes otherwise than in connection with entrepreneurial activity, unless he has entrusted the management of his financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorized intermediary and has 312 ----- opted for the application of the so-called _risparmio gestito_ regime (the “Asset Management Option”) pursuant to Article 7 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997, as amended (“Decree",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

All the above categories are classed as “net recipients”. Where the resident holders of the Notes described in (a) and (c) above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional income tax and may be deducted from the taxation on income due. Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decrees No. 509/1994 and No. 103/1996 may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a _lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1 (100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016_ and in Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of 30 December 2018, as subsequently amended and supplemented.

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decrees No. 509/1994 and No. 103/1996 may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on interest, premium and other income relating to the Notes if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1 (100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 and in Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of December 30, 2018, as subsequently amended and supplemented. Under the so-called “tax declaration regime”, which is the standard regime for taxation of capital gains realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to the extent that they do not opt for the “risparmio amministrato” regime or the Asset Management Option, the 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains net of any relevant incurred capital losses realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities pursuant to all investment transactions carried out during any given tax year. The capital gains realized in a year net of any relevant incurred capital losses must be detailed in the relevant annual tax return to be filed with Italian tax authorities and _imposta _sostitutiva must be paid on such capital gains by Italian resident individuals together with any balance income tax_ due for the relevant tax year. Alternatively, holders of the Notes who are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to which the Notes are connected, may elect to pay imposta sostitutiva separately on capital gains realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes (“risparmio amministrato” regime). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to: (a) the Notes being deposited with an Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of a foreign intermediary); and (b) an express election for the so called risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in due time by the relevant holder of the Notes. The Intermediary is responsible for accounting for imposta sostitutiva in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes, as well as on capital gains realized as at revocation of its mandate, net of any relevant incurred capital losses, and is required to pay the relevant amount to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the holder of the Notes, deducting a corresponding amount from proceeds to be credited to the holder of the Notes. Where a sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes results in a capital loss, the intermediary is entitled to deduct such loss from gains of the same kind subsequently realized on assets held by the holder of the Notes within the same relationship of deposit in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax return of the holders of the Notes. Special rules apply if the Notes are part of (i) a portfolio managed under the Asset Management Option by an Italian asset management company or an authorized intermediary or (ii) an Italian _Organismo di Investimento _Collettivo del Risparmio (which includes a Fondo Comune di Investimento, SICAV or SICAF). In both cases,_ capital gains on the Notes will not be subject to 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains. In particular, under the Asset Management Option, any appreciation of the Notes, even if not realized, will contribute to determine the annual accrued appreciation of the managed portfolio, subject to the Asset Management Tax. Any depreciation of the managed portfolio accrued at year end may be carried forward against appreciation accrued in each of the four subsequent years. Under the Asset Management Option the realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax return of the holders of the Notes. In the case of Notes held by investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs, capital gains on Notes contribute to determine the increase in value of the managed assets of the funds, SICAVs or SICAFs accrued at the end of each tax year. The investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be subject to taxation on such increase, but a withholding or 316 ----- substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders. Any capital gains realized by a holder of the Notes that is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) will not be subject to _imposta _sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be_ subject to a 20% substitute tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest, premium and other income relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 and in Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of December 30, 2018, as subsequently amended and supplemented. Where a holder of the Notes is an Italian resident real estate investment fund or a real estate SICAF, to which the provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as subsequently amended and supplemented, apply, capital gains realized will be subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax in the hands of the real estate investment fund or the real estate SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders of such real estate investment funds or real estate SICAFs in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of units or shares. Moreover, in certain circumstances, income realized by an Italian real estate investment fund or real estate SICAF is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders or shareholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis. Any capital gains realized by Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes are connected or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, will be included in their business income (and, in certain cases, may also be included in the taxable net value of production for IRAP purposes), subject to tax in Italy according to the relevant ordinary tax rules. _Non-Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_ The 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains may in certain circumstances be payable on any capital gains realized upon sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident individuals and corporations without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy. However any capital gains realized by non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected through the sale for consideration or redemption of the Notes are exempt from taxation in Italy to the extent that the Notes are listed on a regulated market (including a multilateral trading facility, which has been equated to a “regulated market” for income tax purpose by the Italian tax authorities in paragraph 2 of the circular letter no. 32 of December 23, 2020) in Italy or abroad, and in certain cases subject to timely filing of required documentation (in the form of a declaration (autocertificazione) of non-residence in Italy) with Italian qualified intermediaries (or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) with which the Notes are deposited, even if the Notes are held in Italy and regardless of the provisions set forth by any applicable double tax treaty. Where the Notes are not listed on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading facility in Italy or abroad: (a) Pursuant to the provisions of Decree No. 461, non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected are exempt from _imposta _sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for consideration or redemption of the Notes if_ they are resident for tax purposes in a White List State. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected elect for the Asset Management Option or are subject to the _risparmio amministrato_ regime, exemption from Italian capital gains tax will apply provided that they timely file with the authorized financial intermediary an appropriate declaration (autocertificazione) stating that they meet the requirement indicated above. The same exemption applies in case the beneficial owners of the Notes are (i) international entities or organizations established in accordance with international agreements ratified by Italy; (ii) certain foreign institutional investors established in White List States; or (iii) Central Banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. 317 ----- (b) In any event, non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected that may benefit from a double taxation treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon sale or redemption of Notes are to be taxed only in the country of tax residence of the recipient, will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for consideration or redemption of Notes.

The Asset Management Tax is applied on behalf of the taxpayer by the managing authorized intermediary. Interest accrued on the Notes held by Italian collective investment funds, SICAVs and SICAFs is not subject to the imposta sostitutiva, but is included in the aggregate income of the investment funds, SICAVs and SICAFs. The Italian collective investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be subject to taxation on such result, but a withholding tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders. Where an Italian resident noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by article 17 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) and the Notes are deposited with an Italian resident intermediary, Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to _imposta _sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be_ subject to a 20% substitute tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year (which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes).

To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the Notes without the application of 26% _imposta sostitutiva, non-Italian resident investors indicated above must: (a) be the beneficial owners of payments of Interest on the Notes, if the Holder is not an institutional investor; (b) deposit the Notes in due time together with the coupons relating to such Notes directly or indirectly with an Intermediary, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian bank or financial intermediary, or with a non-Italian resident operator participating in a centralized securities management system which is in contact via computer with the Ministry of Economy and Finance; and (c) file in due time with the relevant depository a declaration (autocertificazione) stating, inter alia, that he or she is a resident, for tax purposes (or established, for institutional investors), in a White List State.

In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

The possibility of any such redemption or excess payment may implicate the provisions of Treasury Regulations relating to contingent payment debt instruments, or “CPDIs”. The Issuer does not intend to treat the Notes as CPDIs due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring and such excess payments being made. Assuming the Issuer’s position is respected, any such additional payments would generally be taken into account by a U.S. holder at the time such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s usual method of accounting for tax purposes. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. The Issuer’s position is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS successfully challenged this position, the tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes could be materially different than those described herein, including with respect to the character, timing and amount of income, gain or loss recognized.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such stated interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so received if such U.S. holder does not convert the foreign currency into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such U.S. holder will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of foreign currency that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency amount will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may instead elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period and, with respect to the portion of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, that lands on the last day of a taxable year, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to all debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such interest payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time.

The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the original issue date). In the event the Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders of the Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant 321 ----- yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders of the Notes generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The amount of any OID with respect to a Note includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro _rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may_ vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. Regardless of the method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest”. A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. Generally, for these purposes, all receipts of proceeds on a Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder, increased by OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to the Note, if any, translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of _Stated Interest”.

If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders 322 ----- in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest”. However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest and accrued OID, if any) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered (as described above) would apply to foreign passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the U.S. Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.

Accordingly, a beneficial owner of a Note that is neither a U.S. holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “non-U.S. holder”) should not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to the Notes. Due, however, to the Lumens I/C Loan, the IRS may successfully assert that there is a potential tax avoidance plan and that all or a portion of any payment of interest on the Notes should be treated as from sources within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that case, a non-U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) with respect to interest payments on the Notes unless certain certification requirements have been fulfilled (such as providing applicable IRS W-8 Forms). We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of the Notes and there can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position concerning the tax treatment described in this paragraph. We currently do not intend to withhold on any payment made with respect to the Notes to non-U.S. holders. However, in the event that the interest income were treated as from sources within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purpose, we or the applicable withholding agent may withhold on payments made with respect to the Notes to non-U.S. holders unless the certification requirements described above are met, and we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld. In that connection, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes, by its purchase and acceptance of the Notes, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows: (i) if such holder or beneficial owner is not a “United States person” as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, (i) such holder or beneficial owner qualifies for an exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to payments of interest pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; or (ii)(x) such holder or beneficial owner does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the Issuer’s voting stock within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code; (y) such holder or beneficial owner is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Issuer through actual or constructive stock ownership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and (z) such holder or beneficial owner is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; (ii) such holder or beneficial owner (and any intermediary through which such holder or beneficial owner holds the Notes) qualifies for an exemption from any taxes imposed under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (which shall, for this purpose, refer to any taxes imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (and any amended or successor version), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code, or any law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing); (iii) such holder or beneficial owner is able to provide any required U.S. tax documentation to certify to the foregoing representations or to such holder’s or beneficial owner’s status as a “United States” person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code upon reasonable request by the Issuer or an applicable withholding agent; and 324 ----- (iv) such holder or beneficial owner agrees to give to each person to whom such holder or beneficial owner transfers the Notes notice of its requirement to meet the foregoing tax representations and documentation requirements.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,557,TAXATION,557.9,Certain Danish Tax Considerations,557.9.2,Individual Investors Resident in Denmark,"Notes owned by individual investors who are resident in Denmark for Danish tax purposes may fall within two categories depending on whether the interest rate and/or the principal is adjusted according to certain reference assets. For tax purposes a distinction is made between: (a) Notes falling within Section 29, Subsection 3 of the Consolidated Act No. 1390 of September 29, 2022 on the Taxation of Gains and Losses on Claims, Debts and Financial Contracts (kursgevinstloven), as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Danish Capital Gains Tax Act”), which are Notes that are adjusted in accordance with price development on securities, goods, indices, assets or other metrics, as long as the price development can be subject to a financial contract, whether in the form of an adjustment of the principal or other payments under the Notes and whether or not the Notes Certificates are fully or only partially adjusted in accordance therewith; and (b) other Notes, including Notes linked solely to the development in a foreign currency and certain consumer price or net price indices. It is unlikely that the Notes will fall under Section 29, Subsection 3 of the Danish Capital Gains Tax Act (kursgevinstloven) since notes with fixed interest rates are not considered as financial contracts for the purposes of Section 29, Subsection 3 of the Danish Capital Gains Tax Act (kursgevinstloven). Hence. we assume that the Notes qualify as ordinary debt instruments for Danish tax purposes covered by the Danish Capital Gains Tax Act (kursgevinstloven). _Interest_ Income taxable as interest is taxed as capital income in the income year in which it falls due for payment. Capital income is taxed at a rate of up to 42% (in 2023). _Capital Gains_ Gains and losses on Notes, including currency gains, are included in the calculation of capital income. However, a de minimis threshold will apply to the effect that net gains and losses on debt claims, debt in currency other than Danish kroner and certain units in certain types of investment funds falling under Section 22 of the Consolidated Act No. 172 of January 29, 2021 on taxation of capital gains on sale of shares (aktieavancebeskatningsloven) below DKK 2,000 per year will not be included in the taxable income. Further, tax deductibility of losses realized on Notes which are traded on a regulated market is subject to the Danish tax authorities having been notified of the acquisition of the Notes as further outlined in Section 15 of the Danish Capital Gains Tax Act (kursgevinstloven). Losses realized on Notes on which Denmark is prevented from taxing interest or gains pursuant to a tax treaty will not be deductible. The Notes are taxed upon realization (i.e. redemption or disposal). Gains and losses are calculated in DKK as the difference between the acquisition sum and the value at realization. Individuals may elect to apply a mark-to-market principle for all receivables (including Notes) traded on a regulated market and/or currency exchange gains and losses on receivables and debt (including Notes) denominated in currencies other than DKK. Once the mark-to-market principle is elected, a change back to the realization principle requires approval from the Danish tax authorities. Under the mark-to-market principle, a gain or a loss is calculated as the difference between the value of the Note at the beginning and the end of the income year, beginning with the difference between the acquisition sum of the Note and the value of the Note at the end of the same income year. Upon realization of the Note, the taxable income of that income year equals the difference between the value of the Note at the beginning of the income year and the value of the Note at realization.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Benefit Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Benefit Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Benefit Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Benefit Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should consult with its counsel in order to determine the suitability of the notes for such Plan, including whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. In addition, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment satisfies the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Each Benefit Plan, including IRAs and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates, agents or employees (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Benefit Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Benefit Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Benefit Plans from engaging in certain transactions involving “plan assets” of such Benefit Plans with persons or entities who are “parties in interest”, within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, any of the Transaction Parties. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Benefit Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. For example, the acquisition and/or holding of Notes by a Benefit Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/ or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of Notes by a Benefit Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between a Benefit Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the Benefit Plan. In addition, the United States 328 ----- Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct and indirect prohibited transactions arising in connection with the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting investments by life insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers). Each of these exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of a Benefit Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these or any other exemption should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the exemption and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that all of the conditions of any such exemptions or any other exemptions will be satisfied. Plans that are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction requirements of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws that include similar requirements. Any fiduciary of such Plans should determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under such Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the Notes (including any interest in a Note) should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (i) are entitled to exemption relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and are otherwise permissible under all applicable Similar Laws or (ii) would not otherwise constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any violation of applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the excise taxes, penalties and liabilities that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering acquiring the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the suitability of an acquisition of the Notes in light of such prospective purchaser’s particular circumstances, potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investments and whether an exemption would be necessary and, if so, applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. Purchasers have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) do not violate the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code, or any applicable Similar Laws. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any Transaction Party or any of their respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan or that such investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The Initial Purchasers are J.P. Morgan SE, BofA Securities Europe SA, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, UniCredit Bank AG, DNB Markets, a division of DNB Bank ASA, HSBC Continental Europe S.A. and Natixis. Sales in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from us, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any of them are purchased. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. None of the Issuer or the Guarantors will for a period of 45 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except the Notes and the guarantees thereof, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Guarantors or the Issuer and having a tenor of more than one year that are substantially similar to the Notes without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to persons who are not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Important Information” and “Transfer Restrictions”. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to the Issuer; - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any securities to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation and, in Italy, Article 100 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998, as amended (the “Italian Financial Act”), and implementing regulations by the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (“CONSOB”), including CONSOB Regulation No. 20307 of February 15, 2018, as amended (“Regulation 20307”), Article 34-ter, first paragraph, letter (b) of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as amended (the “Issuer Regulation”). 330 ----- Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling any in scope securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been or will be prepared. Offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties (“ECP”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared. Offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and professional clients only, each as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”. The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the Issue Date, which will be the sixth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being herein referred to as “T+6”). Under Rule 15(c)6-l under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trades expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next three succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+6, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. 331 ----- The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer _Restrictions”. The Issuer has applied to list the Notes on the Official List of the LuxSE and to have the Notes_ admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not, however, obligated to make a market in the Notes and may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes _Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited”._ You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilization Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. The Stabilization Manager may also over-allot the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilization Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transaction. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions, engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, provide currently and may provide in the future, commercial lending and banking, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the Issuer, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees, commissions and expenses. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders or agents under the Revolving Credit Facility, receive customary fees for their services in such capacities and will benefit from the repayment of the outstanding amounts thereunder with a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Notes, as described under “Use of Proceeds”. In addition, certain of Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may hold Existing Notes. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the Existing Fixed Rate Notes (as described under “Use 332 ----- _of Proceeds”) and, to the extent that the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates hold Existing Fixed Rate_ Notes, they will receive a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Notes. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates (including the Notes). The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Funds and/or other investment vehicles advised by affiliates of any of the Sponsors may place a purchase order for and be allocated Notes at a purchase price per Note equal to the relevant issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its affiliates routinely hedge, and certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. 333 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above. In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory provisions of Italian law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws enforceable in the United States, would not be recognized or enforceable in Denmark. A final judgment properly obtained in a U.S. federal or state court would therefore neither be recognized nor enforced by the Danish courts without re-examination of the substantive matters thereby adjudicated. In connection with any such re-examination, the judgment will generally be accepted as material evidence, but the parties must provide the Danish courts with satisfactory information about the contents of the relevant foreign law and, if they fail to do so, the Danish courts may apply Danish law instead. Further, certain remedies available under U.S. law may not be allowed in Danish courts, i.e., if they are contrary to Danish public policy, including, among other remedies, punitive damages. The Danish courts may award damages only to the extent necessary to compensate for actual economic losses. Similarly, procedural remedies, including specific rules on the taking of evidence such as the rules on “discovery” in the U.S., may not be available in legal proceedings before Danish courts. Similarly to the above, there can be no certainty that the Danish courts will enforce court judgements or orders obtained in the U.S. against any of the directors, officers, or other executives of a Danish guarantor, or that Danish courts will otherwise entertain actions in other jurisdictions.

According to the Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters,_ recognition and enforcement in Spain of such U.S. judgment could be obtained _provided that the following conditions are met: - the U.S. foreign judgment is final and conclusive (firme); - the U.S. foreign judgment does not contravene Spanish public policy (orden público) or mandatory provisions and the obligation to be fulfilled is legal in Spain; - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter since the dispute is clearly connected to the United States and the choice of the court is not fraudulent; - there is no material contradiction or incompatibility of the U.S. judgment with a judgment rendered in Spain; and there is no pending proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in Spain initiated prior to the U.S. proceeding; - there is no material contradiction or incompatibility with an earlier judgment rendered in any other state _provided that such judgment complies with the applicable conditions to be enforceable in Spain;_ - the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement is accompanied by a literal, authentic, sworn Spanish translation; - the copy of the judgment presented before the Spanish Court is duly apostilled; - there is not a pending previous proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in Spain; - there is not an incompatible judgment rendered in Spain or previously rendered in another country-when this last judgment meets the requirements to be eventually recognized in Spain; - where rendering the U.S. foreign judgment, the courts rendering it must not have infringed an exclusive ground of jurisdiction provided for in Spanish law or have based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds; - that the foreign judgment meets the requirements provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Law if the issuer is subject to insolvency proceedings in Spain; - the rights of defense of the defendant have been protected where rendering the foreign judgment, including but not limited to a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to prepare its defense and appear before the courts; and - the U.S. judgment was not rendered by default (i.e. without appearance or without the possibility to appear for the defendant). - finally, although reciprocity is not a legal requirement, if it were proven that the foreign jurisdiction in which the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish Courts on a general basis, then the Spanish Courts could be compelled to deny the recognition of the foreign judgment in Spain. Any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequátur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil). Once a judgment has been recognized under the exequátur proceedings, it will be enforceable in Spain in accordance with the Spanish Civil Procedure Law in particular, it will be applicable the lapse of legal action (five years). According to Article 3.2 of the Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters, the Spanish Government may deny cooperation with another state’s authority if there has been a reiterated refusal to cooperate or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation is imposed by such other state’s authority _provided that the Spanish Government passes a Royal Decree for these purposes. Furthermore, and according to article 47 of Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters, there is a special provision and a special rule concerning the recognition of foreign judgments rendered in proceedings 344 ----- resulting from collective action, which may be enforced in Spain insofar as they satisfy the conditions set forth therein. The Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters expressly prohibits that a foreign judgment is reviewed as to its substance (revisión del fondo) by the Spanish competent court. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by Spanish law (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in Spain or from Spanish persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Any judgment obtained against the companies incorporated in Spain in any country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby. The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the Issuer or a Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be paid in euros. The enforcement of any judgments in Spain involves, _inter alia, the following principal actions and costs: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) payment of certain professional fees required for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain (if needed); (c) judicial tax and fees; (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney-at-law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); (e) original or authenticated copy of the judgment duly apostilled or legalized must be filed; (f) a document evidencing the service of process in the event that the judgment was rendered in default of appearance must be filed; and (g) evidence of the judgment being final and conclusive (firme) and executory must be filed. Under Spanish law, the content and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts. In addition, in accordance with Article 1 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and such rules will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the relevant agreement or the Notes. As an alternative to the exequatur proceedings, the parties might agree to bring the original action to Spain, so that the dispute is settled by Spanish Courts. Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish Civil Procedure Act, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly agree to the submittal to one judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) (provided that under the Spanish Civil Procedure Act and the Spanish Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, _Orgánica del Poder Judicial) the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the corresponding dispute);_ however, this article does not expressly cover the validity of nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts. If an original action is brought in Spain, the choice of law made by the parties may be rejected by Spanish courts on grounds that it contravenes Spanish public policy (orden público) or enforcement may not be granted in the event that Spanish courts deem that a right has been exercised in such a manner to constitute an abuse of right (abuso de derecho). 345 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The determination of where any such company has its “center of main interests”_ is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and conflicting views. The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. Moreover, the determination of where a debtor has its center of main interest is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), second sentence, of the Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s center of main interest “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. In the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other EU member state. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations. If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one EU member state under the Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU member state (other than Denmark), although secondary 346 ----- insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another EU member state (other than Denmark). If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction (subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation and, for avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU member state. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the EU member state where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the EU member state within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of such proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori _concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency_ proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been opened there and subject to certain other exceptions (for instance, rights _in rem_ situated in another EU member state remain subject to the original laws governing such rights). The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets. The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. Whereas the Insolvency Regulation primarily deals with jurisdictional and procedural matters in connection with insolvency proceedings, Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Restructuring",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The Restructuring Directive provides a number of principles and minimum standards, together with certain discretionary provisions and measures, aimed at creating effective preventative restructuring (or “second chance”) frameworks in EU member states and making insolvency procedures more time and cost efficient. 347 ----- The preventative restructuring procedures introduced by the Restructuring Directive contemplate a debtor-inpossession process, whereby debtors remain at least partially in control of their assets and the day-to-day operations of their business while benefitting from a stay on individual enforcement actions. The Restructuring Directive further contemplates a ‘restructuring plan’ process pursuant to which companies may agree compromise arrangements with their stakeholders, provided the proposal is approved by a majority of no more than 75% of the amount of claims or interests, or (where applicable) of the number, of affected parties in each class. Restructuring plans must allow for cross-class cramdowns, meaning one or more classes of affected parties may be bound by a compromise on the basis of the approval of one or more other classes, provided the plan is confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority. To the extent that a debtor’s equity-holders do not participate in a restructuring plan, legislation must prevent them from unreasonably obstructing the adoption of the restructuring plan. New or interim financing granted during a restructuring process must be exempt from anti-avoidance rules (unless additional grounds under domestic law are present) and may be accorded priority over existing debts, and other restructuring related transactions which are reasonable and necessary for the negotiation of a restructuring plan are to be protected in a subsequent insolvency of the debtor. In the event that the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. _Corporate Benefit_ An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company _ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over 348 ----- an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity. _Financial Assistance_ In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. _Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_ Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantor. It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian guarantor’s assets, even if it is uncertain, however, whether courts are entitled to debate and to rule over such determinations. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void. _Limitations to the Notes Guarantees and Collateral_ In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, _inter alia, corporate benefit and financial assistance, the maximum amount that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy (each an “Italian",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code. In particular, the Italian Government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters which came into force on July 15[th] 2022 (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency”, as subsequently amended and supplemented and including Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of 17 June 2022 implementing the EU Directive 2019/1023, hereinafter the “Italian Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38 — Suppl. Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Italian Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new 355 ----- definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e _dell’insolvenza della società) provided for by the same Italian Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning_ group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new crisis settlement procedure (composizione negoziata della crisi); (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) the_ adoption of the definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (ix) the introduction of the new restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di _ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) among the restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società); (x) the regulation of adequate measures and plans to early_ detect a crisis with specific criteria to be adopted by companies and (xi) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. The Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020, (ii) the Italian Draft Legislative Decree on “Amendments to the Business _Crisis and Insolvency Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023” approved on March 17, 2022 by the Italian_ Council of Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri) and (iii) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022. Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Italian Insolvency Code has been initially postponed to September 1, 2021 by the “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law June 5, 2020, no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”), and is now effective starting from July 15, 2022. Provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law continue to apply only to any filings for proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and any filings seeking for the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or for the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e. the effective date of the Italian Insolvency Code). Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain main aspects of insolvency law in Italy as it stands now and in particular: (i) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the other ancillary applicable regulations in place until July 15, 2022 and (ii) of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry into force. Italian Bankruptcy Law - applicable to proceedings filed or opened before July 15th 2022 only. In particular, please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the other ancillary applicable regulations. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet with ordinary means its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio described below, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under Italian_ law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. 356 ----- _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it provides the debtor with significant advantages and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being very likely reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger various liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing temporary financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (introduced by Law Decree 118/2021)_ The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021 requesting the competent court pursuant to art. 9 of the Italian Insolvency Law, to confirm or modify the protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if necessary, to enact the interim measures provided for pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021 on the same day as the publication of the request in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below); and if necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures” and, together with the Protective Measures, the “Measures”), and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 asking the court to authorize certain acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur. The _composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore _commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_ assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow and it is likely that the financial recovery shall occur, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Law Decree 118/2021, _inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a composizione negoziata della crisi (i) shall certify that no requests for the admission to a concordato preventivo procedure nor _accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti_ have been previously filed to the court in such respect and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata della crisi is dismissed, may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after the aforementioned dismissal. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the _composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to group of companies, in order to provide for the possibility of the negotiated proceeding to take place in a unitary form. It should be noted that Paragraph 10 of such provision provides for the group companies – at the end of the negotiations – to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021 (as set out below) as a whole group or enter separately as single companies into the solutions referred to therein. The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and an independent expert (the “Expert”) which however, pursuant to Article 23 of the Law Decree 118/2021, is prevented for enterprises having filed to access the procedures, debt restructuring agreements and/or _concordato preventivo, including (i) pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, (ii) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (iii) the procedures of over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No. 3 of January 27, 2012 (i.e. _procedimenti di composizione della crisi da _sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio) pending such procedures. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Law_ Decree 118/2021 the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the negotiated proceeding. If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s financial and business situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. 357 ----- The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue for up to an additional 180 days (pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any), which declares the termination of their related effects. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims. From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent by the court. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), he must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will be ineffective. The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days. The judge, in his or her discretion, may order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration. Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request. Pursuant to Article 9 of the Law Decree 118/2021, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: 358 ----- (i) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new supersenior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (ii) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called _prededucibile) via shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (iii) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect the interests of all relevant parties involved. Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the _composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as follow: (i) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; (ii) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (iii) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. In such case, the independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, shall not be required. At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Alternatively, the entrepreneur may: (i) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (ii) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 which pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021 can be filed only following the end of the negotiations; (iii) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the so-called Prodi bis procedure or Marzano procedure. Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021: (i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or _concordato _semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio;_ (ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; 359 ----- (iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021; (iv) payments and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions provided for pursuant to Article 216 and 217 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. _Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio (introduced by Law Decree 118/2021)_ Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio). If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file, with the competent court of the place where the company has its registered office, a petition for admission to the _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which may divide the creditors into various classes. The petition for _concordato semplificato _per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing_ with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply. The court issues a decree approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. _Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors or any public authority including tax authorities. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the 360 ----- reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_ The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt restructuring agreements, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraphs 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di _ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._ The new Article 182-bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan, inter alia, if any substantial change to the plan are is necessary or required before or after the homologation of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors, the entrepreneur shall make the appropriate changes aimed at the implementation of such plan, requesting (i) the independent expert to renew its report as well as (ii) the creditors involved in such debt restructuring agreement to manifest their consent the necessary amendments. The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182-octies, Article 182-novies and Article 182-decies, thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code. 361 ----- Pursuant to the new Article 182-novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (therefore implying that the plan must be adequate and capable for the full and timely payment of dissenting creditors); (b) does not previously file a petition for admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and (c) does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so-called “cramdown”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-participating creditors shall be satisfied to a no lesser extent than the liquidation alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a nonliquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category (and, therefore, affected by the proceeding) have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa) and the related documentation. If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-participating creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-participating crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it. Pursuant to Article 11 of The Law Decree 118/2021 the percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case, the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid. Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182-octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the non-participating creditors, _provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and _(iii) the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the recovery_ strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. The debt restructuring agreement provided under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the standstill agreement provided under Article 182-octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182-decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 18/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with nonlimited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors. 362 ----- Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 percent of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (finanza _ponte) or granted in execution of the composition with creditors (finanza in esecuzione) may be granted such_ priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to the Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called _prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_ company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. _Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a _concordato preventivo_ (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the _concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before_ the sanctioning of the _concordato preventivo_ by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the _concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% 363 ----- of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a _concordato preventivo_ (so called _concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or an Italian Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. In particular, as regards to each of the Italian Guarantors, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement: 349 ----- (a) the Notes Guarantee and security interests to be granted by each of the Italian Guarantors will only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under the relevant Tranche of the Notes and shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including (i) with respect to Flos, the Flos I/C Loan, and (ii) with respect to B&B, the B&B I/C Loan) advanced from time to time to the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following 22 November 2018, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or of security granted by the Italian Guarantors, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or _surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Notes_ Guarantee; (b) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Flos, also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes; (c) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by B&B, also in accordance with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the original principal amount of the Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the original principal amount of the Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes; (d) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the relevant Italian Guarantor at that time; (e) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations of any of the Italian Guarantors under its Notes Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively; and (f) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest by: (i) Flos does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment obligations under Tranche B (each as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes; (ii) B&B does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment obligations under Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes. The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” and/or refinancing indebtedness in relation to “acquisition debt” in respect of, respectively, Flos and B&B and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to refinance the portion of the Existing Notes that has been utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of, respectively, Flos and B&B. Should the Notes Guarantees and/or 350 ----- the security interests granted by Flos and/or B&B, respectively, be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Notes Guarantees and/or security interests could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Notes Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to the relevant Italian Guarantor, such Italian Guarantor will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Notes Guarantee shall not be in force and effect. In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than the Parent, Flos and B&B) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. The maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Existing Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees and security. _Trust_ The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is only granted in 351 ----- favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante _comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_ appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. _Certain additional Considerations in Relation to Notes Guarantees and Collateral_ Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below), any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration are ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced Article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code, according to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Considerations—Judicial Winding-Up (liquidazione giudiziale)” and _“Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of_ the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising management and coordination powers vis_à-vis the entities subject to such powers and claims of the entities subject to such powers_ _vis-à-vis the entities exercising them deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial winding up of in the year before, are subordinated. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries (including Flos and B&B) under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan (including the Flos I/C Loan and/or the B&B I/C Loan) are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries (including Flos and B&B), which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including Flos and B&B) may be impaired or restricted. 352 ----- _Certain Limitations on Enforcement_ The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of (i) Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) and/or (ii) Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below) and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Consideration–Judicial Winding-Up (liquidazione giudiziale)” and “Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; 353 ----- - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15th 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market value returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls or, in the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding or bankruptcy/judicial liquidation proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of applicable remuneration (including interest, default interest, fees, charges, expenses and other costs and any other form of compensation related to the Notes) exceeding the thresholds permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian Usury Law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving 354 ----- from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act )) may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the secured creditors from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or judicial liquidation of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial liquidation the pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares. - In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 and following of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,562,CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,562.5,Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the,562.5.1,Italian Insolvency Code,"Please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry force on July 15, 2022 which supersedes the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The two primary aims of the Italian Insolvency Code are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. The aim of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure (which remain available to large companies also in the context of the new set of rules, as will be further detailed below), is to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under the Italian Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a debtor upon a petition filed by the debtor itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2, letter (b) of the Italian Insolvency Code, is defined as the state of the debtor, manifested by defaults and/or other external elements evidencing that the debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a debtor is insolvent. The Italian Insolvency Code also introduced a specific concept of crisis, which is defined under Article 2, letter (a) of the Italian Insolvency Code as the state of the debtor such that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested by the inadequacy of prospective cash flows to meet obligations in the following twelve months. Both insolvency and crisis are factual situations upon the occurrence of which different instruments provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code may be activated. In cases where a debtor is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, a state of crisis/financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the debtor, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and insolvency alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent debtors and, in certain cases, also to debtors experiencing an economic or financial imbalance such as to make it likely that a state of crisis and/or distress or their insolvency will occur. _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code_ The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa was originally introduced in the Italian legal framework by Law Decree 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into the Italian Insolvency Code. It is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code requesting the competent court to confirm or modify the Protective Measures provided for pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code 370 ----- on the same day as the publication of the request in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below), and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures necessary to complete the negotiations, and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition asking the court to authorize certain acts in line with the provisions set forth under Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is a proceeding aimed at facilitating the recovery of companies which “despite being in conditions of asset or economic and financial imbalance such as to make it likely that financial distress or insolvency will occur, have the potential to remain in the market, including through the sale of the business or a branch of it”. According to Article 12 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi _d’impresa can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore commerciale) and agricultural_ (imprenditore agricolo), which are undergoing a distressed situation with reference to their assets, their business and/or their financial situation, such that it is likely that a distress/crisis or insolvency will follow. It is, therefore, a procedure aiming at anticipating further deterioration of the debtor’s situation. Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code, inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a _composizione _negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (i) shall certify that no judicial winding-up proceedings or similar_ proceedings are pending towards itself nor requests for the admission to the procedures provided for under Articles 40 of the Italian Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles 44, paragraph 1, letter a) and 54, paragraph 3, have been previously filed and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata per la soluzione _della crisi d’impresa is dismissed, other than the case where such dismissal is requested by the entrepreneur, may_ not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after dismissal. Pursuant to Article 25 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi _d’impresa may also apply to group of companies, which may commence one proceeding all together. It should be_ noted that paragraph 9 of such provision provides for the group companies—at the end of the negotiations—to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 23, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code as a group, or use one of the tools referred to under Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, both separately or as a whole group. The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is commenced on a voluntary basis only, filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and independent expert to the Secretary General of the relevant Chamber of Commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform (the “Expert”). Pending a procedure for over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14_ter of Law No 3 of 27 January 2012 (i.e., procedimenti di composizione della crisi da sovraindebitamento e di _liquidazione del patrimonio), the petition cannot be filed. Pursuant to Article 16 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the negotiated proceeding. The Expert is appointed within five days upon the filing of the request. The Expert is responsible for facilitating and managing the negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other interested parties, in order to identify a solution to overcome the crisis or the insolvency, including through the transfer of the business or a branch thereof. The Expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and his/ her own time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete and real chances of recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted by its advisors. If the Expert finds that there are concrete and real chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. The entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation and manage his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in an informed manner, and the access to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa does not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply to negotiations involving employment contracts. 371 ----- If the Expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue up to further 180 days (pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 7 of the Italian Insolvency Code) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 19 and/ or Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code. Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8 of the Italian Insolvency Code, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any) which declares the termination of their related effects. Pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures, which may also be limited, upon entrepreneur request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a specific category of creditors. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims. From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the composizione negoziata, the ruling of opening the judicial winding-up proceeding (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the declaration of the insolvency of the entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the court, provided that the court revokes the Protective Measures. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. However, the creditors may suspend the fulfilment of the pending contracts from the publication of the petition requesting Protective Measures to the obtainment of such Protective Measures. If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will be ineffective. The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days, given that the judge may discretionary order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration. During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Italian Insolvency Code, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. At the request of the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the Expert, the Court that has granted the Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures may, at any time, revoke such measures or reduce their duration when they do not meet the aim 372 ----- of ensuring the positive outcome of the negotiations or they appear disproportionate in relation to the prejudice caused to the creditors, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code. If the Protective Measures are revoked, the prohibition of the obtainment of preemption rights by preexisting creditors ceases to be effective for the date on which the Protective Measure has been revoked. Pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: (a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called _prededucibile) via shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article 2112 of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking also into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect all the interests involved. The court shall also verify the compliance with the competitiveness principle in choosing the purchaser. Pursuant to Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi _d’impresa can terminate as follow:_ (a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 25-bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; (b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. d) and 324. With such agreement the Expert acknowledges that the reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) seems to be consistent with the composition of the insolvency and crisis of the entrepreneur. At the end of the negotiations, if none of the above mentioned agreement is executed, the entrepreneur may alternatively: (a) file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The_ percentage referred to under Article 61, paragraph 2, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code is reduced to 60% if the achievement of the agreement results from the final report of the Expert. (b) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (c) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code; (d) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in the socalled Prodi-bis procedure or the Marzano procedure; Furthermore, pursuant to Article 24 of the Italian Insolvency Code: (i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code shall maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised prejudicial liquidation composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), opening of the judicial winding-up proceeding (apertura della liquidazione giudiziale), a sanctioned 373 ----- restructuring plan provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code, a compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or simplified prejudicial liquidation composition with creditors agreement aimed at the liquidation of the debtor’s assets (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code; (ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code if they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; (iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 165 and Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register pursuant to Article 21, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code or if the competent court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. _Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_ Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio). If, in its Final Report, in the context of a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa proceeding, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome (i.e. the entrepreneur has not been able to reach an agreement with its creditors) but have been conducted according to fairness and good faith and that the options provided under Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, letter b), of the Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file to the competent court where the entrepreneur has its center of main interests a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato _per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 39 of_ the Italian Insolvency Code. The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Italian Insolvency Code are produced. Following the filing of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to, inter alia, express an opinion on the entrepreneur’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the opinion of the auxiliary and the final report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing on the list filed by the debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the court approval (omologazione). Creditors and any third party which has any interests are entitled to object to the court approval (omologazione) within ten days before the date fixed for the hearing. If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance with priority creditor claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not prejudice the creditors with respect to the alternative of a judicial winding-up liquidation and that, in any event, it ensures a benefit to each creditor, it approves the composition with creditors proposal by decree, by which it shall also appoint a liquidator. The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) the _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_ when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the 374 ----- entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. With the approval decree, the court also appoints a liquidator. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer by a preidentified third party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets to such third party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of better solutions on the market, may implement the offer. _Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) addressed to the creditors and prepared by debtors who are either insolvent or in a state of crisis, in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei _Revisori Contabili) must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data_ provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the independent expert. The independent expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Also, Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. However, the possibility to adopt such tools to liquidate the debtor is disputed, as it is argued they shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-judicial liquidation agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Insolvency Code provides that, should these plans fail, and the debtor be declared insolvent, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted on the debtor’s assets for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to any claw-back action (azione revocatoria), including the claw-back action provided for pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, as provided for pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register of the plan, the report by the independent expert and the arrangements is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-judicial liquidation agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the reorganization plan (or the agreements entered into to implement it) is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent judicial winding-up, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was certified by the independent expert. Unlike Italian Bankruptcy Law, Italian Insolvency Law sets forth specific rules regarding Out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant restructuring arrangements entered into with creditors, which must be followed for the plans and agreements to grant protection against claw-back actions and potential civil and criminal responsibilities. More in detail, out-of-court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial situation of the debtor and which also needs to indicate, among others, the causes of the crisis and the new resources which will be made available to the debtor and the industrial plan. Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor and rebalancing its financial position and, in case of its failure and subsequent challenge (impugnazione) before an Italian court, it must not be deemed as being unreasonable. 375 ----- _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) provided for pursuant to Article 57 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code may be entered into by the debtor with creditors holding at least 60% of the outstanding indebtedness, to be sanctioned (omologato) by the competent court. An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the indebtedness vis-à-vis nonparticipating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms in a 120-day term from: (i) the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code, only a debtor who is insolvent or facing a state of crisis (as described above) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled with the opposition (if any), the court will validate (omologare) the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 30 days of its publication pursuant to Article 51 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The Italian Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the debtor or a third party carrying out the business, or the sale of the business, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Article 58, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. More precisely, in the event of substantial amendments to the plan before the approval, the report issued by the expert and the consent to the debt restructuring agreement expressed by creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed in the event of substantial amendment. In the event of substantial amendments after the approval, the debtor shall make such amendments as are appropriate to ensure the implementation of the agreements, by requesting the update of the certified report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in Article 57, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code. In this case, the renewed certified report, together with the amended restructuring plan, shall be published in the companies’ register, giving appropriate notice to the creditors by registered letter or by certified email (PEC). The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. _The key features of a debt restructuring agreement_ With the petition for the approval by the court of the debt restructuring agreement (or at any time pending the procedure) the debtor may request to be granted any Measures (e.g., a stay of actions or the creation by creditors of security interest (unless it is agreed in the debt restructuring agreement) in relation to pre-existing debts, etc.). Such Measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to Article 54, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, to the court by the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition for approval of the agreement), subject to certain conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for approval of the debt restructuring agreement includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). No dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a debt restructuring agreement, but the court may appoint a judicial commissioner to oversee the proceedings and must do so in case petitions for the opening of judicial liquidation are pending, when it is necessary for the protection of the parties who filed such petitions. It is a court-supervised procedure, which can take from a few months up to more than a year (the duration of the proceedings are generally influenced by challenges). Creditors entering into the debt restructuring agreement are not required to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable to third-party non-adhering creditors, who shall be fully re-paid within 120 days from validation (omologa) of the debt restructuring agreement (if the claims are already due and payable at such date) or within 120 days from the 376 ----- respective maturity date if such creditors’ claims are not yet due as of the validation date of such debt restructuring agreement as per respectively Article 57, paragraph 3 letters a) and b). The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing to be held no earlier of 15 days from the notification of the relevant filing. Pending such deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the approval. At such hearing, the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met. Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreement by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their status and economic interests) and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”). More in detail, debt restructuring agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad efficacia _estesa) provided pursuant to Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code – which were previously only permitted in_ relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries where such debts represented at least 50% of the total indebtedness – can now be applied to any category of creditors, provided that, inter alia: (i) all the creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the start of the negotiations and have been able to participate in them in good faith and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation as well as on the restructuring agreement and its effects; (ii) the agreement provides for the continuation of the business activity either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 84 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (iii) the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category represent at least 75% of all the claims belonging to the same category; (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category to which the effects of the agreement are extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount not lower than the amount they would receive with the judicial liquidation being understood that a creditor may hold claims in more than one category; and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement, the application for court approval and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to be crammed down. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 61, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid. Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement (convenzione di _moratoria) entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the_ non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 62, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code has been appointed and certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that the treatment reserved to non-adhering creditors is at least equal to the one they could obtain in the context of a judicial winding up, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations, have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. In no case debt restructuring agreements provided for under Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code and standstill agreements provided under Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code may impose on the non-adhering creditors, inter alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. Furthermore, Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the so called facilitated debt restructuring agreement (accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati). Such proceeding, is a particular kind of debt restructuring agreement which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total indebtedness (instead of the 60% generally required under Article 57, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code) provided that the debtor: (i) has waived the standstill on the payment of non-consenting creditors (usually provided for by law, for 377 ----- a period of 120 days from the court approval of the agreement or from the maturity date of the relevant obligations, in “ordinary” restructuring agreements); and (ii) has not previously requested to the court the granting of protective interim measures on the its assets. By virtue of Article 59 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors. The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Pursuant to Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis: the debtor may repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the installments due under a loan agreement which is secured by way of a security interest over the assets used in the business, provided that: (a) at the date of the filing of the application for admission to the composition with creditors, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations or the court authorizes the payment of the debt for principal and interest due at that date; and (b) the expert meeting the requirements set forth in Article 52, paragraph 3, of the Italian Insolvency Code certifies (i) that such payments are essential for the continuation of the business activity and functional to ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors (as already required by Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code) and, (ii) that the secured claims can be fully satisfied with the proceeds of the liquidation of the asset carried out at market value and that the repayment of the installments due does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors; the court may authorize payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing of the application for the composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business whose continuation is envisaged under the plan. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 73 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case of revocation of the approval (omologa), the court, upon the debtor’s petition, shall order the conversion to a judicial winding-up procedure. If the revocation results from acts of fraud (atti in frode ai creditori) or non-performance of the obligations arising under the debt restructuring agreement, the petition for conversion may also be proposed by creditors or by the public prosecutor. In case of conversion, the court shall grant additional time to the debtor aimed at supplementing the documentation and shall act in accordance with Article 270 of the Italian Insolvency Code. _Court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (as defined above) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of insolvency proceedings (so called “concordato preventivo”). Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross_ revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million. Only the debtor can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo with the court based in the location of the debtor’s main office. The debtor must file the petition together with, among others, a restructuring plan containing an analytic description of manner and timing of the fulfillment of the proposal and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company. The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register by the registry of the court and communicated to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the _concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for the admission to the concordato proceedings includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). As already 378 ----- described with reference to debt restructuring agreements, at any time pending the proceedings, the debtor may request to be granted Measures, which can also be requested pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes (which is mandatory in certain cases provided under the Article 85 of the Italian Insolvency Code), provided that each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic interests; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Save for the provisions provided for under Article 109 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 86 of the Italian Insolvency Code has provided that, in the context of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis (concordato con continuità), the plan may provide for a standstill for the secured creditors, which may extend up to six months from the date of sanctioning (omologa) of the composition with creditors proposal for the payment of secured creditors (creditori _privilegiati) pursuant to Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (i.e. employees, professionals etc.). Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) with the relevant filing for such proceeding, external resources are contributed which increase the assets available at the time of such filing by at least 10% and (ii) the degraded secured creditors as well as unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage equal to 20% of their total claims. In this respect, it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed notwithstanding the provisions set forth under Articles 2740 and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that such distribution complies with the 20% requirement set forth above. Resources contributed are considered as “external” when provided for any reason by the debtor’s shareholders without obligation of repayment or subordination, in relation to which the plan provides them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision does not apply to composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato _con continuità aziendale)._ Under the composition with creditors, there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains management powers under the supervision of a court-appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the deputy judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business, although extraordinary transactions require the prior written approval of the court. Provided that the abovementioned steps are taken, during this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. The accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except for claims secured by pledges, liens or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the _concordato preventivo_ is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. Any act, payment or security executed or created after the filing of the concordato preventivo application and in accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also exempt from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 322, third paragraph (“preferential bankruptcy”), and 323 (“simple bankruptcy”) of the Italian Insolvency Code, in relation to acts and payments made in execution of the Composition with Creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company have super senior priority (prededucibilità) in the event of a subsequent judicial winding-up (see “Statutory priorities” below). For details regarding super senior financing, please refer to the paragraph relating to debt restructuring agreements. The filing of the petition for the _concordato preventivo_ may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary and simplified petition pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code. For sake of clarity, under Italian Insolvency Code, the simplified petition may be utilized by the debtor also to access a debt restructuring agreement or a restructuring plan subject to approval by the court (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) or a 379 ----- _concordato. The debtor company may file such petition, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the_ proposal and all relevant documentation (or the debt restructuring agreement, or the restructuring plan) within a period assigned by the court (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial winding-up proceeding are not pending. If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may, among other things: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 106 of the Italian Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. As mentioned above, filing the simplified petition, the debtor may request the application of Measures. Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 1, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the simplified petition being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into judicial winding-up. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the “full” application, the court may, _ex officio, after hearing the debtor and if appointed the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the simplified petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the _concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) have super priority (prededucibilità) in case of a subsequent judicial winding-up. The concordato preventivo proposal may also provide, inter alia: (i) the continuation of the business by the debtor as going concern; or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies (concordato con continuità _aziendale) as well as for a particular composition with creditors proceeding through which any assets that are no_ longer necessary to run the business of the company are liquidated (concordato misto). According to Article 84, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the _concordato misto qualifies as a_ _concordato con continuità _aziendale, regardless the “portion” of business for which going concern is envisaged. In these cases, the plan and_ the petition for the _concordato preventivo_ must fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Existing contracts, even if entered with governmental bodies, are automatically not to be terminated by admission to procedure. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Under Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a debtor who files for a concordato pursuant to Articles 44 and 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized to pay prefiling claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that they are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific period of time during which creditors can express their vote. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). 380 ----- Article 91 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, if the composition with creditors’ plan, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court or the delegated judge shall order that for appropriate publicity to be given to the offer itself in order to acquire competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are received, the court or the delegated judge, by decree, shall order the opening of the competitive proceeding. Furthermore pursuant to Article 91, paragraph 4, the judicial decree referred above establishes the procedures for the submission of irrevocable offers, providing that in all cases, among others, the following is ensured: (a) their comparability, (b) the requirements for the participation of the bidders, (c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information, (d) any limits on their use, (e) the manner in which the judicial commissioner must provide them to those who request them, (f) the manner in which the competitive procedure is to be conducted, (g) the minimum increase in the consideration to be provided by the subsequent offers, (h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders, (i) the forms of publicity, and (j) the date of the hearing for the evaluation of the bids if the sale takes place before the court. With the sale or with the assignment, whichever is earlier, to a person other than the original bidder identified in the plan, the latter and the debtor are released from their obligations towards each other and accordingly the debtor shall amend the proposal and plan in accordance with the outcome of the competitive proceeding. The concordato preventivo is voted on within the period of time scheduled by the court and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, or (b) the majority of the receivables admitted to vote is reached the majority of the classes. Pursuant to Article 109, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case one creditor holds more than the majority of receivables admitted to voting, it is also necessary to reach majority by headcount. The _concordato preventivo_ is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the _concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. Among others, (i) the companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been perfected during the year preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from voting. The court may approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the non-adhering creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions (in particular in comparison with the judicial liquidation). If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a non-adhering class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case (including the judicial winding-up). The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their positive vote is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in Article 88 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to a judicial liquidation scenario. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 90 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan within 30 days prior from the related creditors’ vote on the debtor’s plan - in a court supervised composition with creditors proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti _chirografari), considering also that such percentage is reduced to 20% in case the debtor has filed for a composizione negoziata provided for pursuant to Article 13 of the Italian Insolvency Code._ 381 ----- Differently from the general rules set out above, pursuant to Article 109 paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composition with creditors on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità), is approved if all the creditors’ classes vote in favor of such composition with creditors arrangement. In each class, the relevant composition with creditors’ proposal is approved if the majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted favorably, provided that the creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. In case of non-approval, Article 112, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code shall apply. In this respect, it should be noted that secured creditors shall not vote if their claims are satisfied in cash, in full, within 180 days from the sanctioning (omologa) of the concordato con _continuità and provided that the security interests supporting the related claims remains firm until the winding-_ up, functional to their satisfaction. In case of claims of employees or other claims secured under Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the delay is reduced to 30 days from the approval by the court. Pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, after the approval of the _concordato _preventivo proposal, non-adhering creditors (or creditors belonging to a non-adhering class) representing 20% or_ more of the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In such case, the court has the authority to “cram-down” non-adhering creditors, compelling their acceptance of the plan, if it deems that the proposed treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a judicial winding-up scenario. After the creditors’ approval, the court approves the composition with creditors and appoints one or more liquidators in order to execute the approved plan if it has to be realized by way of a transfer of assets. The court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. Pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the creditors do not approve the concordato preventivo, the delegated judge (giudice delegato) shall promptly inform the court which, having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, shall declare the opening of the judicial winding-up proceeding. The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to time, by the debtor are not automatically affected by the concordato preventivo proceeding and normally continue pending the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article 97 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti) if the continuation of such agreements is inconsistent with the prospects and the execution of the composition with creditors’ plan, except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro _subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may_ be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the _concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are pending, renewable just once. When the composition proposal together with the relevant plan have been submitted, the suspension may also be authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however, may not exceed thirty days from the date of the decree opening the procedure, which may not be further extended. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the concordato preventivo procedure. Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition with creditors plan or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the _concordato_ can be terminated or annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial winding-up may follow, at the behest of the relevant court. if the composition with creditors is implemented, terms and conditions of payments are amended as per the concordato proposal, and the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor. In case of non-minor breaches, the _concordato_ may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought within one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself. The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of one or more creditors in case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have been willfully exaggerated. The 382 ----- relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of the concealment/exaggeration and, in any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the _concordato itself. Available financing forms under the Italian Insolvency Code_ The enactment of the Italian Insolvency Code did not change the main features of the previous legal framework set out in the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The aim at preserving the value of the company as a going concern and maximizing creditor’s repayment are the main goals both of the previous legal framework and the Italian Insolvency Code. However, the new provisions under the Italian Insolvency Code remove some uncertainties and clarifies some debated issues. In addition, the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law focused mainly on the perspective of creditors already having claims against the company to avoid that the expectations of recovery of such claims were reduced due to the potential considerable increase in predeductible claims and, to this extent, granted a preeminent role to the independent expert together with the court authorization procedures. Unlike the former legal framework, the new provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code focus more on preserving the business value of the distressed company as a going concern by strengthening the key role of the financing of the debtor in the context of the relevant proceedings. The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo). The main features of the provisions concerning different available financings under the Italian Insolvency Code are set out below. _Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraphs 1 to 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is maintained exclusively in a view of liquidation, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Italian Insolvency Code or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code (in relation to the court-supervised composition with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness, subject to the court’s authorization with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that: (i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (C) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern or to the proceedings; and (ii) the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing are functional to the continuity of the business activities until the sanctioning (omologa) of the relevant insolvency proceedings or to the opening of the proceedings or to conduct them and, in any case, are aimed at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the court recognizes that there is the urgent need to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione _giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case_ the petition or the expert report contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement. _Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related claims) granted, in any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) (finanza _ponte), may be granted such priority status provided that (i) they meet the requirements of Article 99, paragraphs_ 1 and 2 (described above), and (ii) it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the _concordato preventivo. The indebtedness under such financing 383 ----- option may be secured, subject to the court’s authorization, with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims. _Implementation financing - Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code, any financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and expressly provided for in the relevant plan, enjoy super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent judicial liquidation, save for the below (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing, unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement or of the supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors, as in such case the priority status is afforded to 100% of the financing) according with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of Italian Insolvency Code. In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the composition plan or the debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be based upon false data or omission of relevant information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement. _The shareholders’ financing – Art. 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Pursuant to Art. 102, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code super senior ranking status also applies to any financings made available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or granting counterindemnities) up to 80% of their amount. Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is made available by an entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of a composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such financings benefit of super senior ranking status and the 80% threshold limitation set out in Paragraph 1 does not apply. _Super senior ranking - Art. 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 of the Corporate Crisis and Insolvency Code_ Super senior ranking _(prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings, interim financings and implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above. Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are expressly qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6(2) of the Italian Insolvency Code which clarifies that their super senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings (including in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings). As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of acts of fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements). Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings on the one side and for the implementation financings on the other side. More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information are relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of the independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on included in plan underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement. With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 Paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although authorized by the court in the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do not benefit from super senior ranking when it is proved (jointly) that: (a) the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or when the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and (b) the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the aforementioned circumstances. 384 ----- With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 Paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively): (a) when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement turns out to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or (b) when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the lenders providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment of the financings. _Restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)_ An important novelty concerns the crisis regulation procedures governed by Title IV of Part I of the Italian Insolvency Code, is the new figure of the restructuring plan subject to homologation _(piano di ristrutturazione _soggetto ad omologazione) (the so-called “PRO”, the rules of which are set out in the new Articles 64-bis and 64- ter of the Italian Insolvency Code)._ This new tool, takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of regular insolvency proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this regard, it should be noted that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that plans to satisfy its creditors by dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests. This instrument allows the plan’s proceeds to be distributed even in derogation of the principle of “par condicio _creditorum” (i.e. the equal treatment of creditors), provided that the proposal is approved by unanimous consent_ of the classes. A judgement of admissibility is provided for by the court, which is called upon to assess the proposal’s timeliness and to verify the correctness of the class formation criteria. Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common framework applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e. concordato preventivo, debt restructuring agreement and also to judicial winding-up). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di _ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of submission of the application until its approval, is_ based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement: the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing interest of the creditors under the supervision of the court commissioner. The debtor is, in any case, allowed to amend the application at any time, formulating the proposal of composition (concordato preventivo). In that case, the time limit for approval is shortened. Similarly, the debtor that has filed an application for composition with creditors may amend the application by applying for approval of the restructuring plan provided that the application is made before voting commences. In each class, the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favor, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. The court will approve the restructuring plan in the event of approval by all classes. If a dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser extent than the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. A creditor that has not objected to the lack of convenience in its observations may not file an objection referred before, unless it proves such the lack of objection was due to a cause not attributable to it. In summary the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an opportunity instrument which minimizes the admissibility phase, providing greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to be effectively approved. Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano _di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court of appeal_ within the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court. _Court-supervised composition for small debtors_ The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor does not meet the dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools. Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the concordato preventivo, but it entails the involvement of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di risoluzione della crisi), which assists the debtor in preparing the 385 ----- paperwork and filing the petition, and performs the activities and duties which, in a _concordato preventivo are prerogatives of the judicial commissioner. _Judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale)_ The judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of an insolvent company’s assets and for the distribution of the related proceeds. It results in the company’s liquidation. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also evidenced by defaults and/or external elements, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. The judicial winding-up is declared by the competent court and is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_ had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Pursuant to Article 37 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the request to commence the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) the administrative bodies and authorities that have control and supervisory functions over the company, (iii) by one or more of the debtor’s creditors and (iv) in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. Upon the commencement of judicial winding-up proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as secured claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the judicial receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the judicial receiver (curatore) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision; - the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made or received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third parties that have been carried out after the declaration of insolvency are not effective as regards the creditors of the debtor (Article 145 of Italian Insolvency Code); - the debtor is dispossessed, and the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the judicial receiver (curatore). The debtor may no longer validly act in court as claimant or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 142 of the Italian Insolvency Code). The judicial receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated judge. However, all pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the date the adjudication is issued and need to be reinitiated by or against the judicial receiver; - the beginning of the judicial winding-up involves the cessation of all the activities of the company with a view to a sale of all assets. However, continuation of business may be authorized by the court if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors. If the competent court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa), the management of the business is entrusted to the judicial receiver (who may in turn avail himself of qualified third parties for this purpose); - certain payments made, security interests given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain period before the debtor’s submission to a judicial winding-up procedure (varying from six months to two years) 386 ----- can be set aside and clawed back if certain conditions are met (provided for pursuant to Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code); - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the insolvency declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for the Italian Insolvency Code. In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written petition requiring the Court to give the judicial receiver (curatore) a deadline of no more than 60 days; within such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the deadline without the judicial receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. Judicial winding-up proceedings, as per the former bankruptcy proceedings under Italian Bankruptcy Law, are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed judicial receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The judicial receiver is not a representative of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate property. Furthermore, the parties of a judicial winding-up proceeding as well as any interested party, may file an appeal (opposizione) to the decree closing the judicial winding-up proceeding within 30 days after having been notified of the same. - **Composition with creditors in judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale). Pursuant to Article 240 of the Italian Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation proceedings can terminate prior to the actual judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) of the debtor, through a proposal for a composition with creditors in judicial liquidation. By way of preliminary note, such agreement occurring in the context of a judicial liquidation proceeding (i) replaced the former proceeding defined as “concordato fallimentare”, a composition with creditors agreement occurring in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) formerly provided for under Article 124, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (ii) should be kept distinct from the concordato preventivo, which is an independent insolvency proceeding. This particular composition with creditor agreement arrangement benefits in a certain way both the debtor as well as the creditors, in fact while the former is released of the debts falling into the relevant plan also regaining free disposal of his assets, the latter is satisfied faster and to a greater extent than they would have been with the full completion of the judicial liquidation process pertaining to the debtor’s assets. The creditor, a third party or the debtor himself formulates a proposal having as its object a “plan” to satisfy creditors, including preferential creditors, in full or in part. In case the _concordato nella liquidazione _giudiziale is proposed by the debtor, such proposal, inter alia, (i) shall be filed after 1 year from the opening_ of the judicial liquidation proceeding and (ii) shall provide for the contribution by the debtor of resources that increase the value of the debtor’s assets by at least 10%. Such proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the creditors and finally by the court. In case the court’s decree approving the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale becomes final (definitivo), the court declares the judicial liquidation to be closed and terminated, initiating the enactment phase of the _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale. In the context of a_ _concordato nella liquidazione _giudiziale, the competent court supervises both the proposal and execution phases while the judicial receiver_ (curatore), once the liquidation is closed, loses his management functions and retains only supervisory duties over the fulfillment of the terms and the conditions of the arrangement obligations arising from or in connection with the aforementioned concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale. Pursuant to Article 240, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal may provide for: 387 ----- (a) the division of creditors into classes, according to homogeneous legal position and economic interests. (b) Under the relevant provision, such division is not mandatory but discretionary, provided two criteria for the class identification: (a) legal position, i.e., the nature of the claim, e.g., unsecured or preferential and (b) the homogeneous economic interests. In this respect, the Italian Insolvency Code requires for the criteria and rationale for the division into classes to be expressly stated in order to avoid the distorted use of class formation, put in place for the sole purpose of obtaining the approval of the abovementioned proposal; (c) differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the reasons of such differences; (d) the restructuring of the financial indebtedness of the debtor as well as the satisfaction of claims in any form possible, by way of example: (i) by assignment of assets; (ii) by assumption (accollo); (iii) by means of other extraordinary transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as well as to companies in which they have an interest), of shares, quotas or bonds, including those convertible into shares or other financial instruments and debt securities. It should be noted that a special feature of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is the option to provide that secured creditors may not be satisfied in full. However, it is necessary for the plan to provide for their satisfaction to a non-lesser extent than that the one which can be realized, by reason of preferential placement, from the relevant proceeds in the event of a judicial liquidation, having regard to the market value attributable to the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption exists. The _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale_ proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the simple majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in the majority of the classes). However, in the event of dissent by more than one creditor’s class, a cram-down may occur (i.e. in case the court decides to approve the concordato - despite a creditor belonging to a dissenting class contests the appropriateness of the proposal) if it finds that the claims can be satisfied by the _concordato to a non-lesser extent than the practicable alternatives. Final court confirmation and sanctioning_ (omologazione) is also required. Finally, once approved and sanctioned (omologato) by the court the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is mandatory: (i) for all existing creditors prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and (ii) for creditors who have not applied for the admission to the judicial liquidation estate, to whom the guarantees or the security interests given in the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale by third parties do not extend. With the termination of the judicial liquidation - as a consequence of the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa), which pursuant to Article 247 of the Italian Insolvency Code may be challenged and appealed within 30 days from its notification - the debtor returns “in bonis” and enjoys the renewed availability of its assets. - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Insolvency Code may be different from the priorities in the U.S., the UK and certain other EU jurisdictions. The proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure) as better identified in Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori _privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law),_ mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti 388 ----- _chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the debtor’s estate are distributed according_ to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire debtor’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. In particular, pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in addition to claims expressly qualified as “prededucibili” under Italian law, among others, the following claims are “prededucibili”: (i) claims relating to expenses and fees for services rendered by the business crisis settlement body; (ii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing for the approval of a restructuring plan subject to homologation, the debt restructuring agreements and for the application for protective measures, to the extent of 75% of the assessed claim and provided that the abovementioned plan or agreements are approved and homologated; (iii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing of for a court supervised composition with creditors procedure as well as the filing of the related proposal and the plan accompanying it, within the limits of 75% of the ascertained claims and provided that the proceedings are opened pursuant to Article 47 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (iv) claims legally arisen in connection with insolvency proceedings for the management of the debtor’s assets and the continuation of the business of the company as well as arising from the professional services required by the related bodies. - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Insolvency Code is the equal treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent statutory priorities or security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim than other creditors. A consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the judicial receiver is strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over the previous year (or, in certain cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinized and potentially unwound as preferential. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of insolvency. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in judicial winding-up compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In insolvency proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up to two years (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Insolvency Code distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective _vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial windingup procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding or in the prior two-year period; and (B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one 389 ----- year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors. - **Acts that may be avoided at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à_vis the debtor as provided for by Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: (i) onerous transactions carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year, where the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; (ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor which were not paid in cash or by other customary means of payment which were carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year; (iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the year prior, in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and (iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the six months prior in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted. Furthermore, payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions and/or granting of priority rights/security interests for debts simultaneously created (event those of third parties) may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective, if the judicial receiver proves that the other party knew of the debtor’s state of insolvency and if made by the debtor after the filing of the petition followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation or during the prior six months. The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: (i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; (ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the entity’s debt towards the bank; (iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, in force as the date of this Offering Memorandum, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; (iv) transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees granted with respect to the debtor’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano attestato di risanamento (see “Out-of-court reorganization plans” (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Articles 56 or 284 of the Italian Insolvency Code” above); (v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted in the context of a court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), of a restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code or of sanctioned debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati) and/or transactions entered into, payments made and security interests legitimately granted by the debtor after the filing of the application for a _concordato preventivo or of an_ _accordo di ristrutturazione dei _debiti (see above);_ 390 ----- (vi) remuneration payments to the entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and (vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring framework (see below under “pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e _dell’insolvenza della società)”) or to other insolvency procedures provided for pursuant to the_ Italian Insolvency Code. Pursuant to Article 170 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating claw-back action proceedings is three years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or, if earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed back. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such petition is filed. In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. In this respect, under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the debtor was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor for the purpose of prejudicing the creditors) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. The Italian Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group transactions. Under Article 290 of the Italian Insolvency Code the limitation period of initiating intra-group claw-back actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five years from the filing for judicial winding-up declaration. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called _fondo _patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by_ the creditor against the third-party purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU. Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures. One of the main novelties included in the Italian Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the organizational, administrative and accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be adequate under Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for the purpose of timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by the debtor. Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, for the purpose of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither the aforementioned Article 3, in its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as amended by the Italian Insolvency Code, contains a precise description of the parameters, conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the definition and especially for the identification of “adequate structures”. In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the purposes to which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for the timely detection of the crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation to the same. In this respect, it is stipulated that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the company’s state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed to be adequate should make it possible to: (i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor; 391 ----- (ii) verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity for the next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical test for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery. For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter alia, as follows: (i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the total monthly payroll amount; (ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an amount greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due; (iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past due for more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any form for at least 60 days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the total exposures; and (iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article 25_novies of the Italian Insolvency Code. _Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)._ The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure”. To be eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for judicial winding-up proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase. _Judicial Phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and_ whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into judicial winding-up. _Administrative Phase. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative_ phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared insolvent. _Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure”. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The 392 ----- Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company insolvent and open judicial winding-up proceedings. _Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), provided for pursuant to Article 293 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code, is only available for public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to judicial liquidation proceedings, save for a different indication under Italian law. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company by the relevant governmental authority (e.g., the Bank of Italy or the Ministry of Economic Development, which are competent for the filing of an application for a declaration of insolvency with the subsequent opening of the compulsory administrative winding-up proceeding). The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under insolvency proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for insolvency proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up. _Common rules for pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società)_ In order to facilitate access and filing of restructuring procedures by the Italian companies, Articles 120-bis and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code have been enacted, introducing a set of rules applicable to all pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza). Among other things, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code and the purposes of a successful restructuring, the plan may provide for “any modification of the articles of association of the debtor company, _including capital increases and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the option right and other modifications that directly affect the shareholders' participation rights, as well as for mergers, demergers and transformations”. Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the company, are prevented from hindering_ the restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a right to information in relation to both the initiation and the progress of the restructuring process, may not remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for the statutory auditors of joint stock companies, also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code it is not considered as being just cause for directors’ removal, the filing for access to the prejudicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) when the related legal conditions and requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 5, shareholders representing at least 10% of the filing company’s corporate capital may make a competing proposal. 393 ----- The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are shareholders to whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes provided for in the plan. The formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes that directly affect the shareholders’ participation rights and, in any case, for large companies and companies with widespread capital. In this context, special conditions for approval of the arrangement are set out pursuant to Article 120-quater of the Italian Insolvency Code when and if the plan provides for shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then provided to ensure that creditors’ interests are protected in all cases in which the restructuring tool envisages shareholders to retain a participation in the company with a certain value. Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In order to avoid any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool, this provision expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation of such restructuring tool, by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors or more specifically to the competent court, in relation to any amendment to the debtor’s by-laws which - being specifically provided for by the plan - do not require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated that changes in the corporate structure resulting from the implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e _dell’insolvenza) shall not be considered as and constitute cause for the termination or amendment of any_ agreement entered into by the debtor with third parties. Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a group to one of the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) aiming at unifying – to the extent possible – the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability lawsuits available to the receiver; and (iii) subordination of claims. _Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_ In a judicial winding-up proceeding, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up to two years (six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of (revocatoria) provided for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of one year prior to the during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such petition is filed. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or of the guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents and/or the Notes Guarantees. 394 ----- It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up proceedings insolvency declaration or in the prior two-year period; and (B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors. In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,562,CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,562.5,Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the,562.5.2,,"latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the _concordato preventivo_ having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and _provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. 364 ----- The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge. The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called _prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the _concordato proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the _concordato preventivo_ (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). 365 ----- To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti _preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_ application for the _concordato preventivo_ or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. _Impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_ In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, _inter alia, on insolvency matters (in addition to the Law Decree 118/2021 mentioned above) in order to (i) preserve the continuity of companies throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that were trading on a going concern basis before the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of certain insolvency proceedings already pending during the COVID-19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree. According to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, the deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements provides, among other things, the extension of 6 months of the deadlines for fulfillment of the obligations provided in an approved concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione _dei debiti omologati based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be extended by six months. In the_ procedures for the approval (omologazione) of a concordato and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a _concordato preventivo in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring_ agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/pre-insolvency scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended on December 31, 2020 and until the five subsequent financial years. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree, subsequently replaced by Article 1, Paragraph 266, of Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations. 366 ----- _Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_ had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore _fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the_ relevant timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after(and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secured creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, 367 ----- whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy estate’s (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The _concordato fallimentare_ proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective _vis-à-vis_ creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. - **Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver. (a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below (so-called “suspect period”), may be clawed back (revocati) _vis-à-vis_ the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: 368 ----- (i) onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; (ii) payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; (iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time when the new security was granted; and (iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time when the new security was granted. (b) The following acts and transactions, if made during the suspect period or such other period specified below, may be clawed-back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: (i) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and (ii) granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. (c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: (i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; (ii) a remittance on a bank account; _provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; (iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; _provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; (iv) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo _di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_ (vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and (vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a 369 ----- transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called _fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried_ out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,562,CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,562.6,Denmark,562.6.1,Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral,"The Danish Companies Act (selskabsloven) contains restrictions on upstream guarantees and security by Danish limited companies. Generally, Danish companies and their Danish and foreign subsidiaries are prohibited from granting loans to and/or issuing guarantees or providing security in respect of obligations of, among others, their direct and indirect parent companies. However, Danish companies may grant loans to or issue guarantees or provide security in respect of obligations of parent companies covered by Danish Executive Order No. 85 of January 30, 2020 (on loans etc. to foreign parent companies) which includes any entity in the corporate form of (i) a public limited company (aktieselskab), (ii) a limited partnership company _(partnerselskab), (iii) a private limited liability company (anpartsselskab) or (iv) a company with an equivalent corporate form, incorporated in a jurisdiction which is a member of the EU or European Economic Area or Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Chile, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan or the U.S. In addition, a Danish company is generally prohibited from granting loans, issuing guarantees or providing security in connection with the financing or refinancing of the acquisition by any person or entity of shares in such Danish company or shares in its direct and indirect parent companies, and any such loan, guarantee or security will be invalid and unenforceable. To the extent that any such debt constituting unlawful financial assistance cannot be separated from other debt, such other debt may be deemed unlawful financial assistance debt and any loans, guarantees or security granted by Danish companies for such other debt may then also be invalid or unenforceable. According to the Danish Business Authority, the prohibition on financial assistance also extends to non-Danish subsidiaries of Danish companies. If loans, guarantees or security are granted in violation of the prohibitions above, such loans, guarantees or security will be invalid and unenforceable and must be repaid with statutory interests. The directors may be subject to liability for losses suffered in this regard. Further, it is a requirement under Danish law that a guarantor or security provider obtains an adequate corporate benefit from the issuance of a guarantee or granting of security. The management of the company is obliged to act in accordance with the company’s individual interests, including, among other things, consideration of the company’s financial position, the benefits the company will obtain through and the risks related to the granting of guarantees and security, assessment of the debtor and ensuring that the arrangement is on market terms. If such benefit is not obtained, the directors of a Danish guarantor or security provider may be subject to civil liability and the guarantee or security may be deemed invalid. It is not clear under Danish case law under which circumstances corporate benefit accrues to a subsidiary when such subsidiary guarantees and secures debt of a direct or indirect parent company or other group company. Accordingly, any guarantee or security provided by the Danish companies in connection with the Notes will be limited (i) if and to the extent required to comply with Danish statutory provisions on unlawful financial assistance and non-permitted shareholder loans, including, without limitation, Sections 206 through 212 of the Danish Companies Act and (ii) to a maximum amount equivalent to the higher of the equity (egenkapital) of such Danish company (calculated in accordance with the approved accounting principles) (a) at the time of the granting of the guarantee or (b) at the time payment is 395 ----- requested pursuant to the guarantee. Hence, the Notes will not have the benefit of guarantees from and security granted by a Danish Guarantor or security provider to the extent the proceeds of the Notes are deemed used towards financing of the (direct or indirect) acquisition of such Danish Guarantor or security provider. Claims may become barred under Danish statutes of limitation or principles of passivity or may become subject to set-off or counterclaim. The Notes and the Security Agent will be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet) pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act, which will allow the Security Agent to represent the holders of the Notes from time to time in connection with any enforcement steps and legal proceedings in Denmark.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,562,CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,562.6,Denmark,562.6.2,Certain Danish insolvency law considerations,"One of the Guarantors and one of the security providers are companies incorporated under the laws of Denmark. Any insolvency proceedings with respect to a Danish Guarantor or Danish security provider would be based on Danish insolvency laws. Please note that the Insolvency Regulation does not apply to Denmark. Danish insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which the investors are familiar. In the event that a Danish Guarantor or Danish security provider experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. In a Danish bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors on a priority of claims. Such liquidation may not yield the same value to the creditors as a reorganization and sale of going concern. _Insolvency Proceedings_ Bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of a debtor or a creditor, however provided that the debtor is insolvent, which pursuant to the Danish Bankruptcy Act is defined as the debtor’s inability to pay his debts as they fall due, unless such inability is considered to be temporary. The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor operates his business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt of the petition for bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive information as to whether and when a debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (debtor’s own petition). The bankruptcy court does not provide information on a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy. A creditor cannot demand that the debtor be declared bankrupt if the creditor’s claim is secured by adequate security. In this context, adequate security means a security right expected to provide full coverage for the creditor. If the security is avoidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been performed, the creditor does not have adequate security. The creditor is not required to have a basis of execution for his claim, e.g. a judgment in a civil case, a settlement in court or a signed debt instrument or mortgage. Further, the creditor’s claim does not have to be due for payment to form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. However, the creditor must have a legal interest in the debtor’s estate being administered in bankruptcy. As a result, not all claims that have not become due for payment may form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. Depending on the circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in force or a repayment arrangement being observed by the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being rejected. The requirement for legal interest also means that in general the bankruptcy court will reject a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy if it is clear in advance that he will not receive any dividend in case of bankruptcy. It should be noted, however, that if there is probable cause to believe that the debtor has made avoidable transactions, the creditor may have the required legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have substantial assets. In that case, the creditor must be able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with some degree of certainty. A creditor having filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor will be liable to pay damages if the debtor suffers a loss or to pay compensation for injury to the debtor’s reputation if the bankruptcy conditions, e.g. the insolvency requirement, are not fulfilled or if the claim does not exist. The petitioner must provide security for the expenses relating to the administration of the estate. In practice, the bankruptcy court demands security in the amount of DKK 30,000. If the debtor has filed the petition for bankruptcy, the security must be provided by the funds of the bankruptcy estate. 396 ----- _Bankruptcy Trustee_ One or more trustees are appointed at the discretion of the bankruptcy court; however, in practice the request of the major unsecured and unsubordinated creditors have the decisive influence as another liquidator can be appointed at a creditor’s meeting. The trustee is not required to be an attorney, but in practice that is normally the case. The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules of the Danish Bankruptcy Act. Consequently, the trustee must not be the debtor’s related party or depending on the debtor, and there must not be any doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is prevented from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification rules. The bankruptcy court may also find that a person being a member of the board of directors of the debtor’s business or a person being the debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee. The trustee will make all decisions concerning the administration of the bankruptcy estate and he represents the estate in every respect. _Reconstruction_ Reconstruction proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of the debtor or a creditor. The petition for reconstruction must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor operates his business. Reconstruction proceedings may only be commenced if the debtor is insolvent (same as described above with respect to bankruptcy). If this criterion is fulfilled, the bankruptcy court will immediately appoint a reconstructor to administrate the company. A reconstructuring accountant is appointed if requested by the company, the reconstructor or at least 25% of the creditors. The management continues to operate the company, but any material transactions may not be carried out without the prior approval of the reconstructor. Payment of creditors may only be done in accordance with the priority of claims as described below. The reconstruction of a company must achieve the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue of the company as a going concern by means of a compulsory composition; (2) the termination of the business of the company by transferring the business; (3) a combination of a compulsory composition and a transfer of business; (4) the enactment of other measures, including, but not limited to, capital injection, debt conversion, and a capital decrease followed by a subsequent capital increase; or (5) the enactment of other measures combined with a compulsory composition and/or transfer of business. The reconstructor must try to achieve these objectives in no particular order. Within the four or eight weeks (until a restructuring plan is adopted), the company can discontinue the restructuring without automatically entering into insolvency proceedings. If the reconstructor does not realize the statutory objectives after a restructuring plan is adopted, the company will automatically enter bankruptcy proceedings as described above, unless it turns out that the company is not (or no longer is) insolvent. _Preventive reconstruction_ The Danish Bankruptcy Act was amended under Act No. 896 of June 21, 2022, which implemented the EU Directive 2019/1023. This introduced the preventive reconstruction scheme, which, in broad terms, bears similarities to the existing reconstruction scheme in both proceedings and statutory objectives. Preventive reconstruction proceedings may only be commenced by petition of the debtor. Furthermore, preventive reconstruction proceedings may be commenced if the debtor is insolvent or if the debtor, owing to financial difficulties, is likely to become insolvent. Preventive reconstruction proceedings can be commenced with or without a stay on enforcement (i.e. that no creditor has any individual pursuit of claims against the debtor whilst the preventive reconstruction proceedings are commencing). If the proceedings are commenced without a stay on enforcement, the debtor is entitled to appoint a reconstructor. Conversely, if the proceedings are commenced with a stay on enforcement, the bankruptcy court will promptly appoint a reconstructor. In situations where preventive reconstruction proceedings are commenced with a stay on enforcement, creditors' rights, such as set-off rights, may be restricted. The rights of a pledgee under a possessory pledge (håndpant) to enforce its security interest remains unaffected by the debtor's preventive reconstruction proceedings or any associated insolvency proceedings. 397 ----- The avoidance rules (see below under Certain Avoidance Rules) are only applicable if a proposal for preventive reconstruction which provides for compulsory composition is ratified. During the preventive reconstruction proceedings, a creditor may file for a petition for bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy court may choose to postpone the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings until a decision has been made regarding the adoption and ratification of the reconstruction proposal. _Liquidation_ Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and, providing all creditors have been paid in full, the shareholders. In Denmark, liquidation is not an insolvency proceeding, and only companies that are solvent can be liquidated. If a company is insolvent, or if it turns out during the liquidation process that the company cannot pay all its creditors in full, the company must enter bankruptcy proceedings instead. The decision to liquidate a company is made by the shareholders of the company at a general meeting who also appoint a liquidator. At the end of the liquidation process the company will be dissolved. _Foreign Currency_ Under the Danish Bankruptcy Act, claims must be converted into DKK at the exchange rate at the day the bankruptcy court issued a bankruptcy order over the company. _Challenges to the Guarantees and the Collateral_ Certain Avoidance Rules Under the Danish Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy estate is entitled to under certain circumstances to avoid the debtor’s transactions in the period preceding the bankruptcy if such transactions have reduced the assets of the estate or otherwise damaged the estate, or if the transactions have favored certain creditors without observing the ranking of the creditors. Transactions damaging the estate are for example gifts, renunciations of inheritance or the payment of excessive salary or pension to related parties. Transactions favoring creditors without observing the ranking of creditors are for example payment by unusual means of payment, payments before due date, payments having deteriorated the debtor’s ability to pay decisively or the provision of security for prior debts. Set out herein is the avoidance rule on security for prior debts and the general avoidance rule applicable to various transactions. Any security interest which has not been created prior to, or simultaneously with, the debt obligations which it secures or which is not perfected without undue delay after the creation of such debt obligations will be subject to a three months hardening period, if insolvency proceedings are commenced against the provider of the security during the three month period starting from the latter of the date of the relevant act of perfection and the creation of the security interest. If it is determined that the security provider was insolvent at the time the security was granted or perfected, such hardening period would be for an indefinite period. Danish law operates with a general avoidance rule, which stipulates that a disposition which unduly favors a creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the company’s property is prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the company’s debt is increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the company was or because of the disposition became insolvent, and the favored party knew or ought to have known about the company’s insolvency and the circumstances that made the disposition improper. Generally, only transactions which are contrary to common norms of correct and decent business behavior will be deemed improper. Improper behavior is normally related to a breach of the purpose of insolvency proceedings, which typically is the situation where a creditor should have realized that a given transaction would deprive the other creditors of their right to fulfilment of their claims. The usual hardening period is three months prior to the filing date, which is extended to up to 24 months for transactions with parties closely related to the company, and the general avoidance rule (as described above) provides for an unlimited avoidance period with respect to improper transactions. Legal Position of Unsecured Claims and Priority of Claims 398 ----- Creditors who believe they have a claim against the debtor or the bankruptcy estate must prove their claims and accompany their proofs of claim by adequate documentation. The trustee registers all claims and examines whether they are legitimate and entitle the creditor to receive dividend. The ranking of creditors is described in the Danish Bankruptcy Act and it indicates the order in which claims against the estate of the debtor are settled. All higher ranking claims must be satisfied in full before the next level will be entitled to dividend. The ranking of creditors is as follows: - _Firstly: claims in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings or claims in according to affirmed agreements; - _Secondly: claims in connection with any prior restructuring proceedings; - _Thirdly: claims for wages or salaries payable; - _Fourthly: claims of suppliers for indirect taxes; - _Fifthly: unsecured claims (all other claims except for deferred claims); and - _Sixthly: deferred claims (interest, fines, promises of gifts and subordinated loan capital).",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,562,CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,562.7,Spain,562.7.1,Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral,"In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure a primary obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. Consequently, if the primary obligation terminated, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null and void. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations. A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be considered material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code. Moreover, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes or to grant security interests over its assets to secure the Notes. Recent Spanish rulings which do not constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars understand, that risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are rulings from the Spanish Supreme Court recognizing the validity of upstream guarantees subject to certain requirements. Furthermore, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or under any security instrument granted by it cannot extend to any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute a breach of the Spanish financial assistance rules. Pursuant to these rules, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under the Notes Guarantee or any security granted or executed by such Spanish Guarantor: (a) shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares (acciones) representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares (acciones) or quota shares (participaciones sociales) representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company (sociedad _dominante), or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares (acciones) representing the_ share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares (acciones) or quota shares (participaciones sociales) representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company (sociedad dominante); and 399 ----- (b) shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 and Article 143 of the Spanish Companies Act, as defined below, and, in that case, all provisions of such Notes Guarantee or security shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can any Notes Guarantee or security given by the Spanish Guarantor provides any such unlawful financial assistance. Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas (S.A.)) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares (acciones) or the shares (acciones) or quota shares (participaiones _sociales) of any direct or indirect parent company (sociedad dominante), and (ii) for private limited liability_ companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares (participaciones socieales) and the shares (acciones) or quota shares (participaciones sociales) of any member of their corporate group. Therefore, Spanish law governed guarantees or security interests granted or assumed by subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the Issuer for the _purpose_ of acquiring the shares of such Spanish subsidiary or the shares (acciones) or quota shares (pariticipaciones sociales) of its direct or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the extent that such security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 and 143.2 of Spanish Legislative Decree 1/2010 dated July 2 approving the recast text of the Spanish Companies Act, as amended (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010 de 2 de julio por el que se aprueba el texto _refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital) (the “Spanish Companies Act”). This limitation may also apply_ to the refinancing of acquisition debt. Accordingly, any guarantee or security interest granted by any Spanish subsidiary shall not apply to the extent the proceeds are used to repay existing indebtedness of the Issuer if such existing indebtedness was used for the purposes described above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, the guarantee granted by any Spanish company will be limited by the amount of the funds that are not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes. For the purposes of the previous paragraph, a reference to a “parent company” of the Spanish guarantor shall mean the company (if any) which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such Spanish guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish guarantor. It shall be presumed that a company has a dominant influence on another company when: - any of the scenarios set out in Section 1 of Article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de Comercio) are met; or - when at least half plus one of the members of the managing body of the Spanish guarantor are also members of the managing body or top managers (altos directivos) of the dominant company or of another company controlled by such dominant company. In addition, a reference to the “group” of each Spanish guarantor shall mean the group of companies that have in common the same parent company (as this term is described above). In addition, Article 158 the Spanish Companies Act provides that the financial assistance restrictions referred to above in relation to transactions targeting shares of a Spanish parent company shall also be applicable to its non-Spanish subsidiaries carrying out such transactions. In accordance with the above, the guarantees and security interests granted by Spanish companies belonging to the same group, shall not guarantee those obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and/or 150 of the Spanish Companies Act. Further, the structure of first demand guarantees is not specifically regulated in the Spanish Civil Code but their validity and effectiveness have been reviewed in several judgments and defined by the Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo) as autonomous, independent and abstract guarantees, detached from the underlying agreement whose obligations are being guaranteed. These judgments acknowledge the validity of provisions pursuant to which guarantors waive the ability to call on enforceability exceptions different to those arising from the guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain case law has also admitted the possibility that, with certain limitations, the guarantor automatically raises the enforceability exception of fraud, bad faith or abuse of right (abuso de derecho) in the event that the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a fraudulent manner or in bad faith. Certain case law has also admitted that the guarantor can stay enforcement by showing that there has been no event of default (the guarantor bearing the burden of proof), usually through a motion for declaratory relief filed by the guarantor. 400 ----- Under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into account when guarantees are enforced. For example, when the enforcement of the guarantee causes the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency. In addition, and whilst this remains a matter debated between Spanish scholars, it is possible that certain defenses available to the Spanish Guarantor relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, capital preservation or thin capitalization may limit the amount guaranteed under the Notes Guarantee by reference to the net equity (patrimonio neto) and share capital of the Spanish Guarantor and the amount secured under the relevant security agreement by reference to the value of the collateral. The law regulating the enforcement of pledges through auctions organized by notaries as described in the Notary Public Law of May 28, 1862 (Ley del Notariado de 28 de mayo de 1862) (the “Notarial Law”) was significantly amended by Law 15/2015 of July 2, 2015 on Voluntary Jurisdiction (Ley 15/2015, de 2 de julio, de la Jurisdicción _Voluntaria) (“Law 15/2015”). There is a high degree of uncertainty on this new legal framework given that some_ provisions of the Notarial Law seem to conflict with laws regarding the enforcement of pledges that were not expressly repealed by Law 15/2015. As a result, certain aspects of these types of auctions are open to interpretation. Amendments to the Notarial Law brought about by Law 15/2015 entered into force on October 15, 2015 and there are no leading precedents as of the date hereof that clarify how Law 15/2015 should be applied in practice. Consequently, the clauses in the pledge agreements governing auctions organized by notaries may not be enforceable in accordance with their own terms. Under the Spanish Companies Act as amended (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se _aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley, de Sociedades de Capital), Spanish companies (both public limited liability_ companies (sociedades anónimas (S.A.)) and private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad _limitada (S.L.))) may issue and guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities_ that recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada_ (S.L.)). In particular, pursuant to Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act, the Guarantee provided by Spanish Guarantors incorporated under the form of limited liability companies (“sociedades de responsabilidad limitada” or “S.L.s”), is subject to the following restrictions: (a) S.L.s can only issue notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its own equity (recursos propios), unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution, (b) also, although there is no consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law exists, S.L.s may also only guarantee notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its own equity (recursos propios), unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution, and (c) S.L.s are prohibited to issue or guarantee (or provide security for) notes convertible into quota shares (participaciones sociales). Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (5 years being the general term established for obligations in personam_ under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim. The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event, among others, be subject to: - the nature of the remedies available; and - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) setoff (unless validly waived), circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim. According to Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the law applicable in the place of location of the pledged asset (lex rei sitae). When the pledged asset is a credit right—such as receivables or intercompany loans—the determination of the lex rei sitae is unclear given its lack of physical existence. In these cases, several theories have been construed amongst Spanish scholars so as to determine the lex rei sitae (such as domicile of debtor of the credit rights being pledged, domicile of pledgor, law governing the credit right being 401 ----- pledged, etc.). If a judge considered that any of the pledges created over credit rights under the Spanish security documents is governed by the Catalonian Civil Code, then this regulation would govern those pledges instead of the Spanish civil common law, which could determine the challenge of the validity of such pledges. _Trust, Trustee and Security Agent under Spanish law_ Spanish law security interests must be granted in favor of each and every one of the Secured Parties under the relevant security document and each secured party must accept said security interest either entering into the relevant security documents themselves or duly represented by a Security Agent with sufficient faculties to represent the secured creditors for such purposes. Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concepts of “trust”, “trustee” or “security agent” and there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of a trustee or security agent (including the Security Agent), whether this would cause delays in the enforcement and the consequences of not being able to enforce the collateral as provided in the relevant security agreements. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee’s actions in an enforcement situation. If Spanish-law security documents are entered into only by the security agent and not also by the creditors on account of whom the security agent or trustee would be acting, it can be argued that the security agent would be the only party entitled to enforce the security interest in respect of those obligations, consequently, the security agent may only be able to enforce against the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as security agent. This limitation may be overcome if such creditors grant due and express powers of attorney in favor of the security agent duly notarized and legalized (and, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961) in order to represent them in the enforcement proceedings (nonetheless, this may not be effective in the case of judicial enforcement proceedings, where one party cannot represent another by virtue of a power of attorney). The holders of the Notes, from time to time, shall be the beneficial holders of any Spanish law security interests. However, given that they will not be parties to the Spanish law security documents that will be executed by the Security Agent on their behalf, the holders of the Notes may not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are the direct beneficiaries of the security interests). Although it could be argued that Article 429 of the Spanish Companies Act (which allows the representative of the syndicate of the holders of the Notes (comisario) to enforce any security interest on behalf of all holders of the Notes under certain circumstances) could apply by analogy, it cannot be disregarded that, if enforcement of the security interest is carried out by the Security Agent, it may be necessary to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose by means of a power of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the Secured Parties duly notarized and, if not granted in Spain, with the apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961 or legalized. In the absence of the above-mentioned power of attorney, the Security Agent and/or Trustee, acting as a security agent, may not be able to enforce the relevant Spanish security on behalf of all of the secured creditors (including the holders of the Notes). Furthermore, any beneficial holders of a security who have not accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) a security agent to do so, may be treated as unsecured creditors under Spanish law, including, without limitation, in an insolvency scenario. In addition, the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced may request the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise and the notarization of each and every transfer certificate relating to each and every transfer of the Notes. Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent the applicable Trustee and the holders of the Notes may be challenged. 402 ----- _Parallel Debt_ The concept of “trust” and/or “parallel debt” (under, for example, the laws of the State of New York or English law) is not recognized under Spanish law and, therefore, guarantees/security interests require that the beneficiary of the guarantee/security interests and the creditor to be the same person. Such guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third party which does not hold the guaranteed/secured claim but purports to hold guarantees/security interests for the parties that do. As mentioned above, if Spanish law security documents are entered into only by the Security Agent (and not by the creditors on account of whom it would be acting), the Security Agent will be the only party entitled to enforce the guarantees or the security interest in respect of those obligations and it may only be able to do so in respect of the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as security agent unless such creditors grant the formal powers of attorney in its favor (duly notarized and legalized or, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961) in order for the Security Agent to represent them in any enforcement proceedings related to Spanish law security documents. Given that parallel debt structures have not yet been tested under Spanish law and we cannot assure you that by creating any such structure it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by such applicable law. If any challenge to the validity, perfection or enforceability of the security interests created by the securities were successful, the holders of the Notes may be unable to enforce the security. Also, under Spanish law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency proceedings, the securities or the parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator, the obligor itself or by other creditors of such obligor under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Spanish insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions by the debtor.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Unlike other jurisdictions, there is no concept of “corporate benefit” expressly regulated under the Spanish Companies Act or any other piece of legislation, however, Spanish lower courts, particularly Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters, are declaring null or rescinding upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable presumption of actions detrimental to the estate of an affiliate granting guarantees or security interests in favor of the liabilities incurred by a parent company and/or other companies of its group for the purposes of article 226 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (i.e. rescission or claw-back of these actions during the two year hardening period prior to the date of declaration of insolvency, irrespective of the existence of fraudulent intent), when the obligations guaranteed or secured does not provide for a direct benefit to the Spanish company granting such guarantee or security interest. Some decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court are ruling in favor of the validity and enforceability of such guarantees and security interests to the extent proof can be given that amounts can be borrowed directly by the company granting the guarantee or security interest or indirectly on-lent or otherwise made available to such company under a intercompany loan agreement, equity contribution or similar arrangement, also taking into account any indirect benefits deriving from the enhancement of the financial position of the group of companies to which such company belongs and the granting of parent guarantees, indemnities and comfort letters for which the relevant company obtains most favorable economic and financial conditions under its contractual relationships with suppliers and other counterparties, in accordance with Spanish case law existing as for the construction of the concept of “compensatory advantage” (ventaja compensatoria). However, it cannot be conclusively ensured that further proof of the actual existence of benefits and compensatory advantages would need to be delivered to court, to the insolvency administrator and/or the insolvency court in the event of an insolvency scenario where the claims of the holders of the Notes, particularly as “special privilege claims” may be challenged if the insolvency administrator or other creditors may allege that such corporate benefit did not exist.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The Spanish full-blown insolvency proceeding (insolvencia), which is referred to as “concurso de acreedores”, applies to all persons or entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Insolvency Law).

As a general rule, a debtor has to file for voluntary insolvency within two months from the date on which it knew, or should have known, that it was in an insolvency situation. The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for such insolvency proceeding when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due (insolvencia inminente). According to the amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is in an imminent insolvency scenario when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due within the following three months. Creditors do also have standing to petition mandatory insolvency (concurso necesario) when the debtor is unable to regularly pay its debts as they become due (i.e., only in an actual insolvency scenario). Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. If the debtor requests the insolvency, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency. The debtor must file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of actual insolvency (inability to regularly pay the debts as they become due). It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Where the debtor fails to file a petition for insolvency within the time period established by law (two months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted by an insolvency authority once the insolvency is declared and the insolvency process is initiated; (ii) the debtor may be unable to exercise certain courses of action; and (iii) the directors may be held liable for unpaid claims (déficit concursal), should the debtor be liquidated and insolvency be classified as “guilty” (concurso culpable). Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by a third party and upheld by the Court. Under section 4 of article 2 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of insolvency if it can prove that following enforcement proceedings it has failed to attach or seize any assets, or sufficient assets 404 ----- from the debtor, to pay the amount owed. A creditor may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the Court (i) a generalized default on payments by the debtor, (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets, (iii) a misplacement, “fire sale”, hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets or (iv) a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e., three months). The general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply if, by means of the communication that is foreseen under article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 _bis communication by reference to a previous regulation – Law 22/2003–), the debtor who is in actual, imminent or likely insolvency, and has not been declared in insolvency, notifies the Court that it has started negotiations with its creditors to seek support for a “restructuring plan” (the “Plan”), in which case it will have an additional grace period of three months and one more to file for insolvency. Such grace period of three months could be extended if, not later than at the end of the initial three-month grace period, either the debtor, or creditors holding more than 50% of the debts that the Plan may affect at that time (net of any credits that would qualify as subordinated (acreedor subordinado) claims in an insolvency situation), may request the Court for a three-month extension, provided the restructuring expert, if one is appointed, issues a favorable report in support of the request. The new law introduces the concept of “likelihood of insolvency” (probabilidad de insolvencia), which is when it is objectively foreseeable that the debtor will be unable to regularly fulfill its obligations that fall due in the next two years unless it enters into a Plan with its creditors. In addition to being able to start negotiating with its creditors with a view to entering into a Plan at any time during this period when insolvency is likely, the debtor will also be able to file for pre-insolvency in court, in which case it will inform the applicable Court that it is trying to negotiate a Plan with its creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

It protects the debtor, for a four-months period (or up to seven months, if extended), from petitions for mandatory insolvency proceedings. As mentioned above, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two-months period does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain support for a Plan, as set out in articles 614 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law. Effectively, by means of the communication that is foreseen under article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 bis communication by reference to a previous regulation –Law 22/2003–), on the top of those two months, the debtor gains an additional threemonths period (or up to six months, if extended) as from the date when the debtor gives such notice, to achieve a Plan with its creditors and one further month to file for insolvency, if the above mentioned period of three months (or of six months, if extended) has elapsed without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. Additionally, during the three-month protection period provided by the pre-insolvency filing (or six months in case it has been extended under the new insolvency regime), enforcement actions are stayed, subject to the following: ###### • As a general rule, neither judicial nor extrajudicial enforcement proceedings may be initiated to seize or attach assets or rights that the debtor requires (the so-called “necessary assets”) to continue its professional or business activities. Previously initiated enforcement proceedings will be stayed. It is not always easy to determine when an asset is necessary to operate the business and the courts decide on a case-by-case basis. They normally take a flexible approach and consider elements such as cash or credit rights as assets that are necessary to continue to run the business. However, creditors may challenge the court clerk’s asset qualification, which the Court will hear. ###### • At the debtor’s request, the Court may extend these stays in relation to one or several creditors or class of creditors in respect of other assets or rights, even if they are not deemed “necessary assets”, if doing so could help bring the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion, provided the restructuring expert, if one has been appointed, has given its consent. The Court decision on this suspension may be challenged by a remedy (recurso de reposición), exclusively. ###### • Subject to the above, enforcing security in rem over “necessary assets” may be initiated but will be automatically stayed. However, neither financial collateral governed by RDL 5/2005, nor in rem security 405 ----- interests over assets located in another Member State (other than Denmark) should be affected by this suspension. In relation to the above provisions, Spanish Courts may apply them, under certain circumstances, in relation to assets held by non-Spanish affiliates of the entity that files for pre-insolvency, with effects outside of Spain. In any case, the above regime does not apply to public credit rights (créditos de derecho público). In such case, enforcement can be suspended in very limited circumstances and, in any case, up to a maximum period of three months. Also, while the effects of pre-insolvency are in force, according to the amended Spanish Insolvency Law, directors’ legal duty to wind up the company in the event of a capital impairment situation (i.e., its net equity is below a half of its share capital) is suspended. In case of essential contracts for the viability of the business, the relevant counterparties will not be entitled to suspend, amend or early terminate such contract for contractual breaches occurred prior to the communication that is foreseen under article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 bis communication by reference to a previous regulation –Law 22/2003–) while the effects of such communication are in force (even if the relevant contracts allowed it). Filing for pre-insolvency has also the following effects: ###### • Over credit rights. Pre-insolvency does not cause itself the early maturity of claims. Contractual provisions amending or declaring the early maturity of claims in case of pre-insolvency shall become ineffective. ###### • Over contracts. Any contractual provisions declaring the early termination, suspension or amendment of a contract with outstanding reciprocal obligations in case of pre-insolvency or analogous proceedings shall be rendered ineffective.

In particular, claims held by public creditors (e.g., tax authorities, and the Social Security) cannot be subject to a haircut, debt-for-equity swap, change of debtor or change of governing law. According to this special regime, as a general rule, their maturity can be extended up to 12 months since the issuance of the homologation ruling and up to 6 months since the issuance of the homologation ruling if a deferral or division in instalments (aplazamiento o fraccionamiento de pago) of such debt has been agreed with the public administration. The Plan must include a minimum content set out in article 633 of the Spanish Insolvency Law and will need to be formalized in a public document (formalizado en instrumento público). In addition, as opposed to the previous Spanish insolvency law, which only allowed a closed-ended list of measures to be imposed on dissenting creditors, a Plan under the Spanish Insolvency Law may contain almost any restructuring alternative, provided it is sufficient and proportionate to ensure the viability of the business and its continuation as a going concern. The debtor and its creditors may agree on any type of measure deemed necessary to effectively restructure the debtor’s business, including changes in the composition, conditions or structure –not only of the debtor’s liabilities, but also of its assets or any part of its capital structure. This could include sales of assets, parts of the business or even the entire business as a going concern, as well as any other necessary operational changes, or a combination of the same. The Plan must nevertheless set out the reasons why it has a “reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency” of the debtor and ensuring the viability of its business in the short and medium term, including the necessary pre-conditions for its success. In addition, the mere judicial approval of a Plan does not affect bilateral contracts with outstanding reciprocal obligations at that time, they remain in force. Moreover, contracts that are deemed necessary to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business cannot be terminated, suspended or amended due to a change in control of the 406 ----- debtor as a result of a debt-for-equity swap contemplated by the Plan. However, the Spanish Insolvency Law specifies certain exceptions to the principle of continuation of bilateral contracts that aim to ensure a Plan’s success, in particular, in relation to: (i) contracts with outstanding bilateral obligations that can be terminated in the interest of the restructuring; (ii) contracts with senior executives (contratos de alta dirección); (iii) financial collateral arrangements and/or netting arrangements; and (iv) certain trade supply agreements. On a separate note, class formation has been introduced by the amended Spanish Insolvency Law. Creditors affected by the Plan will be grouped into classes. The class formation criteria must be based on a common shared interest by each group of creditors and subject to objective criteria. As a general rule, it is presumed that creditors with the same ranking in an insolvency process share a common interest, but they can also be separated into different classes if there are reasons justifying such split (e.g., financial and non-financial nature, conflicts of interests among creditors of different classes or measures to be imposed by the Plan). In any case, secured claims must constitute a single class, unless the different nature of the collateral justifies the creation of separate classes. Claims governed by public law will also constitute a separate class among the classes with the same ranking.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Therefore, the request for the joint insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form part of the same Group. Any of the debtors, or the insolvency administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the procedural consolidation of insolvency proceedings already declared under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the debtors form part of the same Group of companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the procedural consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared (acumulación de concursos) if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among them, or (b) they form part of the same Group of companies, provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrator. Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are processed in coordination, without consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such Group. This means that the creditors of one company of the Group will not have recourse against other companies of the same Group (except where cross guarantees exist, in which case such a claim might be subordinated). The current system is basically a procedural one, aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost efficient as possible. However, exceptionally, and for the purpose of the drafting of the insolvency report, by the insolvency administrator only, assets and liabilities amongst the companies declared insolvent may be consolidated where there is a confusion of states and assets and liabilities belonging to each of the companies cannot be identified, in order to avert unjustified cost and delay.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In this regard: ###### • Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity nor the concept of punitive damages. In principle, the legal remedy which will be awarded under Spanish law is compensation for damages (indemnización de daños). article 1,152 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties will substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish Courts may modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its 407 ----- obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was aimed at such partial performance (and in any event if it is deemed to be disproportionate according to the good faith principle). There is doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive damages. ###### • Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. ###### • Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish Courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties. ###### • Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo), precludes an agreement being terminated on the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants if the basis for termination is not a breach of an obligation that is considered material in view of the particular circumstances (which could be the case in the event of termination on the grounds of cross default or cross acceleration) or which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment obligations under financing agreements), and allows Spanish courts not to enforce any such termination. However, there is case law supporting the idea that if the parties considered that certain breaches should be considered material, the courts should accept them as the basis for a termination of the agreement. ###### • Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply. ###### • A voluntary waiver of statutory rights would not be valid if it were contrary to public order or detrimental to a third party; furthermore, under Spanish law, the waiver of future rights that do not yet exist or of which there is a mere expectation could be deemed null unless ratified upon the rights arising and being perfected. ###### • A Spanish court may modify the obligations deriving from the contracts in the terms it deems necessary in order to restore the balance between the obligations (or even declare them unenforceable) if unexpected and exceptional circumstances arise that were unforeseeable when the contracts were executed, which would not have been expressly or implicitly assumed and entail a drastic change in the consideration or the reciprocal obligations assumed in the contracts, to such an extent that a Spanish court would consider strict compliance with the obligations assumed by this party in the contracts as nearly impracticable or extremely burdensome. In fact, there have been some cases in which the Spanish first instance courts have granted injunctive relief (medidas cautelares) applying the “rebus sic stantibus” doctrine (“hardship”) in order to stop the enforcement of guarantees, even first demand guarantees, when the health crisis situation caused by COVID 19 has upset the balance between the contracting parties, making performance by one to the other unduly burdensome. ###### • In Spanish procedural law, the rules regarding the burden of proof in judicial proceedings cannot be modified by agreement of the parties and, consequently, any provision of the contracts in which decisions, certificates, notifications, opinions or the like issued by the parties are deemed conclusive evidence in the absence of a manifest error, would not be upheld by a Spanish court; except as foreseen in the Spanish Procedural Law for executive proceedings for a sum of money resulting from public documents, if the parties agreed so. ###### • Any document that is not in Spanish must be accompanied by a translation into Spanish for it to be admissible by a Spanish court or authority, which may be required to be sworn. ###### • Under Spanish law, powers of attorney, appointments and authorizations are generally revocable by the grantor (irrespective of whether they are said to be revocable or irrevocable), provided that the revocation is in good faith; however, this general rule would not prevail when the powers of attorney, appointments or authorizations are a necessary consequence of the underlying relationship between the grantor and the beneficiary and such revocation is aimed at frustrating the purpose for which such powers were granted. 408 ----- ###### • The choice of New York law in the Notes will not restrict the application of the Spanish “overriding mandatory provisions,” as defined in article 9.1 of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 17, 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I). Furthermore, Spanish courts may refuse to apply a provision of the chosen law if such application is manifestly incompatible with Spanish public policy. Spanish courts may also give effect to the overriding mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which the obligations arising from the contract have been performed or must be performed. ###### • The exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts includes matters relating to the incorporation, validity, nullification and dissolution of companies or legal entities domiciled in Spain, and any decisions and resolutions of their governing bodies, the validity or nullity of any recording in a Spanish registry, and the recognition and enforcement of any judgment or arbitration award in Spain that has been obtained in a foreign country.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management will be replaced (sustitución) by the insolvency trustee. However, the Court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency trustee’s request, the Court has the power to swap the intervention regime (regimen de intervención) for a suspension regime (regimen de suspensión) or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the insolvency authorities may be declared null and void. The time between the petition and the insolvency declaration by the Court will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the filing has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and in turn whether the debtor has challenged the petition made by the creditor), whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted on a timely basis or it is incomplete, and the workload of the Court.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Early-termination, suspension or amending clauses triggered by the declaration of insolvency or the liquidation become void and unenforceable, unless there exists a legal provision permitting either termination of the contract in the event of insolvency (e.g., RDL 5/2005), or unilateral termination (e.g., swap agreements or agency agreements). The debtor or the insolvency trustee, with the Court’s approval, may request the termination of executory contracts in the interest of the insolvency estate (interés del concurso), including in the absence of contractual grounds for termination. A hearing with the parties will be held at which they will have the opportunity to reach an agreement on the termination and its effects. If an agreement is not reached, formal court proceedings will be held that will result in a decision issued by the Court. The indemnity granted to the contractual counterparty as a result of a contract being terminated early will be an insolvency claim (crédito concursal), and no longer a claim against the estate (crédito contra la masa). As a general rule, it is not possible to terminate an executory contract for breaches that occurred before the declaration of the insolvency proceedings. However, if a material breach of the executory contract occurred after the declaration of insolvency, the non-defaulting party may request the termination of the contract by filing a termination claim with the Court. As an exception to the above, termination due to pre-existing breaches may be admitted if the executory contract is a continuing-performance contract (tracto sucesivo). A continuing performance agreement does not require a one-off performance, but rather successive or continuous performance over an agreed period (for instance, leases or supply agreements). Some case law and legal scholars take nonetheless the position that termination of the contract should not be possible if one party already complied with its contractual obligations prior to the declaration of insolvency. 409 ----- When the default took place before the declaration of insolvency (when allowed), the claims of the non-defaulting party (including indemnity claims) will be an insolvency claim (crédito concursal). On the contrary, claims arising from defaults which took place after the declaration of insolvency will be claims against the estate (crédito contra _la masa). Termination of the contract will also extinguish the outstanding contractual obligations._ The Court may disregard the breach – regardless of whether it occurred before or after the declaration of insolvency –, and order specific performance of the contract for the remaining contractual term, if the continuation of the agreement is deemed to be beneficial for the outcome of the insolvency proceedings. The Court order may be appealed. If the default took place after the declaration of insolvency, the amounts owed to non-defaulting parties arising from the agreement must be paid from the debtor’s insolvency estate within three months after the Court order. If such payment is breached, the continuation of the contract will lose its effect. To ensure that the debtor’s insolvency estate has sufficient financial resources to continue the business, the Spanish Insolvency Law allows the insolvency administrator, either unilaterally or at the debtor’s request, to reinstate (rehabilitación) credit and other facility agreements to which the debtor was a party and which were accelerated by the creditor as a result of a payment default (principal or interest) in the three months preceding the declaration of insolvency. The exercise of this power by the insolvency administrator is subject to three conditions: ###### • the insolvency administrator must provide notice of the reinstatement to the creditor before expiry of the term to lodge claims (that is, as a general rule, one month as from publication of the declaration of insolvency); ###### • the insolvency administrator must satisfy or deposit any amounts unpaid at the time of reinstatement and “assume” future payments against the insolvency estate; and ###### • the creditor must not have started any actions to claim payment before the insolvency proceedings commenced. A similar reinstatement rule exists in relation to deferred-payment purchase agreements that are terminated early within the three months preceding the declaration of insolvency. Additionally, insolvency declaration suspends interest accrual, except for claims secured with an in rem right, in which case ordinary interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding State Budget Law (Ley de _Presupuestos del Estado)._ In any event, set-off is prohibited once the debtor has been declared insolvent unless (i) the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency, even if such compensation is alleged afterwards, or the creditor communicated the existence of the claim to the insolvency administrator; (ii) the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a foreign law that permits set-off; or (iii) the claims and debts arise from the same legal relation. As a general rule, insolvency declaration stays, up to a year, enforcement proceedings tied to collateral necessary to pursue the ordinary course (excluding financial collateral, as defined in RDL 5/2005, which can be enforced at any time, and where the collateral is located outside of Spain). The enforcement of any security over certain assets that are necessary to the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities) is prohibited until the earlier of (i) an arrangement of a composition agreement being reached, provided that the Composition Agreement does not affect such right; (ii) one year having elapsed as of the declaration of the insolvency without the opening of the liquidation phase; or (iii) the judge conducting the insolvency proceedings declaring that the asset is not necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s activities in accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Law. Commencement of the liquidation phase causes the loss of the right to commence a separate enforcement process in relation to those secured lenders who did not commence enforcement either before the declaration of insolvency or after a year since the declaration of insolvency. Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the 410 ----- relevant security interest, that has been granted over such shares/quota shares, does not bring about an early termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic exploitation of the relevant asset.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Based on such documentation provided by the creditors and held by the debtor, the insolvency trustee draws up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa), (ii) claims benefiting from special privileges, (iii) claims benefiting from general privileges, (iv) ordinary claims, and (v) subordinated claims. ###### (1) Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) from article 242 of the Spanish Insolvency Law sets out the so-called “estate claims” which are pre-deductible claims from the estate (excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security), are generally payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other claims). Debt against the insolvency estate includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employees payroll; (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings; (iii) certain amounts deriving from executory contracts and obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, those amounts that derive from the exercise of a claw-back action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it, if tied to bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith); (iv) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion; (v) certain debts in the ordinary course of business incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency; (vi) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a Composition Agreement prior to the opening of the liquidation phase; and (vii) 50% of the new funds lent under a court-sanctioned Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, as long as the claims affected by the approved Plan amount to 51% of the total liabilities at least (or to more than 60% of the total liabilities, if the new financing is granted by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor, after deducting the claims of those persons). ###### (2) Claims benefiting from special privileges (créditos con privilegio especial), representing security on certain assets (essentially in rem security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Law minus senior claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. Claims secured with pledges over future credit rights are only considered specially privileged if (i) the future credit rights arise from agreements or relationships established or executed prior to the declaration of insolvency; and (ii) (a) in the case of possessory pledges, the pledge was granted in a public document before the opening of the insolvency proceedings or, (b) in the case of non-possessory pledges (prenda sin desplazamiento), the pledge was registered with the applicable public registry before the opening of the insolvency proceedings. These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year from the declaration of the insolvency and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law. However, within such waiting period or while any enforcement proceedings remain suspended under the Spanish Insolvency Law, the insolvency trustee has the option to pay the relevant claims against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to Composition Agreement, unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding security which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the Composition Agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the same class vote in favor of such Composition Agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the secured assets on which they are secured. ###### (3) Claims benefiting from general privileges (créditos con privilegio general) include, among others, certain labor debts and certain debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations 411 ----- corresponding to tax debts and social security obligations and debts held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved, are recognized as privileged for up to 50% of the amount of such debts (excluding the claims classified as subordinated). New funds under a court-sanctioned Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (crédito contra la masa) will also be credits with general privileges, as long as the claims affected by the approved Plan amount to 51% of the total liabilities at least (or to more than 60% of the total liabilities, if the new financing is granted by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor, after deducting the claims of those persons). The holders of general privileges are not to be affected by the Composition Agreement except if they give their express support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in the case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the Composition Agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such Composition Agreement. If they do not agree to the arrangement and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the order established by law). ###### (4) Ordinary claims (créditos ordinarios), consisting of non-subordinated and non-privileged claims, will be paid on a pro-rated basis from the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former prededuction of estate claims and generally privileged claims. ###### (5) Subordinated claims (créditos subordinados) are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by virtue of law include, among others, some credits held by parties in special relationships with the debtor (personas especialmente relacionadas). In the case of individuals, this includes their relatives, legal entities controlled by the debtor or its relatives, the factual or legal administrators of such legal entities, any other legal entity forming part of the same Group of companies and the legal entities in respect of which the people described in this paragraph are their factual or legal administrators. In the case of a legal entity debtor, the following shall be deemed as “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would include any specially related party to these shareholders, as described herein), (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, when the claim arises, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company has securities listed on an official exchange market)—when the shareholder is an individual, those who would be specially related to the individual are also specially related to the debtor, (iii) directors (either de jure or de facto), liquidators and general directors holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company (including those people that have held those positions during the two years prior to the insolvency declaration), and (iv) companies pertaining to the same Group as the debtor and (v) common shareholders to the insolvent debtor and to other company of the same group, provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law or to a Composition Agreement shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such Plan or Composition Agreement. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors: they are not entitled to accede to the Composition Agreement and in the event of liquidation, they collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Law (once ordinary creditors have been paid in full).",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Therefore, the declaration of insolvency does not impair the existence of the contracts entered into by the debtor, which would remain in force. Any contractual arrangements establishing the termination, suspension or amendment of a contract with reciprocal obligations and/or entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of the declaration of insolvency of the debtor will be unenforceable. As a general rule, the declaration of insolvency does not alter the general contractual rules on termination, but under the Spanish Insolvency Law, the judge may decide to remedy an eventual default of the insolvent party by 412 ----- reinstating an agreement, with the effect that any outstanding amounts and further payments under the agreement will be post-insolvency claims. If the court deems it appropriate for the interests of the insolvent party, it is also entitled to terminate an agreement, with compensation for damages if it deems it is best for the insolvency proceeding.

Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of initiation of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency trustee may only challenge those transactions that could be deemed as being “detrimental” to the insolvent debtor’s estate, provided that they have taken place within two years prior to the insolvency filing, even in the absence of fraudulent intent. The same rescission grounds apply in relation to any detrimental action carried out or agreement entered into by the debtor within two years preceding the pre-insolvency filing, as well as those carried out since that date up to the declaration of insolvency, even if there has been no fraudulent intent, as long as: (i) the Plan has not been passed or, when passed, has not been approved by the Court; and (ii) the insolvency is declared within a year from the end of the pre-insolvency period. “Detriment” does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interests or on the equality of treatment among creditors. The analysis of whether an action, agreement or transaction is detrimental to the insolvency estate must be made on a case-by-case basis. The Spanish Insolvency Law does not define “detrimental” but it establishes a series of presumptions that give some indication as to how a court would rule in specific cases. Pursuant to the law, (a) detriment exists (as a non-rebuttable presumption, without admission of proof to the contrary) in the case of (i) disposals without consideration, except for ordinary largesse (liberalidades de uso) and (ii) early payment of unsecured obligations maturing after the insolvency declaration (except secured claims); and (b) detriment is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable presumption) in the case of (i) transactions entered into with parties that have a special relationship with the debtor, (ii) the creation of in _rem rights in order to secure pre-existing obligations or those incurred to replace existing obligations, and (iii) the_ cancellation of obligations secured by an in rem security falling due after the declaration of insolvency. In the remaining cases, detriment would have to be evidenced by the party seeking rescission. Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other group companies’ debt may be subject to claw-back, on the basis that such guarantees or security interests may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the Spanish Guarantor is not able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the Spanish Guarantor to grant such guarantee or security (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same Group of companies or the so-called “group interest”). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the Spanish Guarantor is detrimental to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case-by-case basis (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Recent Spanish rulings which do not constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars, understand that risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the validity of upstream guarantees. Case law has sustained that, when the parties had envisaged the creation of the security at the time of granting the financing, if there is a solid business reason to delay the constitution of the security, damage would not exist. In this sense, the Court ruling from Commercial Court no. 1 of Oviedo, dated February 18, 2010 (AC 2010\525) indicated that “in order to value if a security is contextual to the creation or birth of the claim, it must be verified if the transactions that gave rise to granting the claim and the security were conceived by the parties simultaneously, hence reducing any importance given to the temporary delays there may be in order to technically grant the security”. If a claw-back action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction, together with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored to the debtor, the counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value of the assets at the time of their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been conducted in bad faith, the liable party will be obligated to indemnify the debtor for loss and damages suffered as its claim will be classified as subordinated. If the judge does not conclude that the transaction was conducted in bad faith, the counterparty to the debtor will 413 ----- settle its credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and rights to the insolvency estate as per bilateral contracts. The consequence of the court resolution rescinding a prejudicial act is that the parties involved are required to return their reciprocal consideration with any accrued rents or interest (concerning bilateral contracts, otherwise, the only party obliged to return is the non-insolvent one). Such claims are generally regarded as estate claims unless in case of bad faith of the relevant creditor in which case its claims will be subordinated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and 730 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, acts and transactions governed by laws other than Spanish law will not be subject to claw-back actions if such act or transaction cannot be rescinded or challenged by any means and under any grounds whatsoever (i.e., not only in insolvency scenarios) under the relevant non Spanish applicable laws. Procedurally, there is no safe harbor against a lawsuit being filed and lenders being served to appear before Spanish courts, but the lawsuit should be dismissed on the merits if lenders prove (i) that the act or transaction at issue is subject to foreign law and (ii) that such act or transaction is unavoidable under the circumstances pursuant to that foreign law. The exercise of claw-back actions does not prevent other actions against the debtor in accordance with law, which may be brought before the insolvency judge. Under no circumstances can the following be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of the business, provided that they are carried out under market conditions, (ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of values and derivative instruments, (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of public law creditors or credits in favor of the labor authorities, and (iv) transactions subject to foreign law in case the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that such transaction cannot be rescinded under the law to which it is subject to. The amended Spanish Insolvency Law has also included among the transactions that cannot be subject to claw-back any transactions acknowledging and paying public law credits to mitigate the debtor’s liability pursuant to the applicable criminal laws. Neither Plans nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any guarantees instituted in the performance of such Plans will be subject to claw-back actions, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below in section “Protection of Certain Plans Against Claw-back”.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: ###### • the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; ###### • the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party; • such act was fraudulent; • there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and ###### • debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw-back actions where the subjective component or fraud does not have to be proven). Pursuant to article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of 414 ----- attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a juris et de jure presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a juris tantum presumption (a rebuttable presumption). If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return the consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages. The legal time frame for bringing a civil rescission claim is four years.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In order to seek protection against claw-back, Plans can be judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil) that will be competent to conduct a potential insolvency proceeding, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such Plan. If the Plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities, the following will not be subject to claw-back unless it is proven that they were made with an intent to defraud creditors: ###### (1) actions and transactions that were “reasonable” and “immediately necessary” for the successful negotiation of the Plan, if expressly identified as such in the Plan. (a) Any payment of (i) fees or costs in relation to negotiating, signing or confirming the Plan; (ii) fees for legal and professional advice with close relationship with the restructuring; (iii) employee salaries for completed work; and (iv) other amounts in the ordinary course of the debtor’s business activity, will be deemed to be protected actions and transactions; ###### (2) interim and new money: (a) Interim money: new financing granted to the debtor that is reasonable and immediately needed to (i) ensure that the debtor’s activity continues totally or partially while the Plan is being negotiated (and until a Court approves it); or (ii) maintain or increase the value of the debtor’s business or business units. (b) New money: new financing granted to the debtor that is provided for in the Plan and is necessary for its implementation. Interim and new money may benefit from two effects: ###### (i) Protection against claw-back under the same terms as any other actions or transactions resulting from the Plan. As a special rule, in order to protect interim or new money lent by a “specially related party” to the debtor from claw-back, the claims affected by the Plan (after deducting any claims held by specially related parties) must represent more than 60% of the debtor’s liabilities. Otherwise, they will be subject to the ordinary claw-back regime. ###### (ii) Preferential treatment for repayment of interim or new money: in the event of the debtor’s insolvency, 50% of the interim or new money provided in the framework of a court-approved Plan will be treated as a claim against the estate (crédito contra la masa). The remaining 50% will be treated as a generally privileged claim (crédito con privilegio general). This preferential treatment will only apply if the claims affected by the Plan exceed the minimum thresholds described above with respect to the debtor’s total liabilities (i.e., 51% in general, and 60% (after deducting any claims held by specially related parties) if interim or new money is granted by a “specially related party” to the debtor). ###### (3) actions and transactions that are reasonable and immediately necessary to implement the Plan. 415 ----- If the Plan affects claims that represent less than 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities, the actions and transactions described above may still be subject to claw-back, but none of the rebuttable presumptions of detriment explained in section “Hardening Periods” will apply. Therefore (as long as none of the non-rebuttable presumptions apply), the insolvency administrator or the creditor requesting the claw-back will need to evidence the detriment. Court approval of a Plan may be sought merely to ring-fence it from potential claw-back if the debtor becomes insolvent (i.e., without seeking to cram down dissenting creditors). The Court will verify that the relevant majorities required for court approval are met prior to approving the Plan. Judicially sanctioned Plans will not be subject to the insolvency claw-back action, but they may be challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law. As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the Plan if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. In any case, if the relevant threshold is satisfied, the plan will be deemed approved by the total amount of the creditors subject to the syndicated instrument. If the threshold is not satisfied, votes of consenting creditors will be taken into account on an individual basis, unless the syndicated claims constitute a single class of creditors (in which case it will be deemed that that class has not approved the Plan). In addition, dissenting creditors under a syndicated instrument can challenge the restructuring plan before the Courts. A Plan can be approved either by all classes of creditors if certain majorities are reached within each class (consensual plans) or not by all classes of creditors (non-consensual plans or cross-class cram-down). For the latter to happen, the Plan must meet one of the following two requirements: (a) it must be supported by a simple majority of the classes, provided at least one of those classes is composed of claims that would benefit from a general or special privilege (i.e., secured claims) if the debtor were declared insolvent; or, failing that, (b) it must be supported by at least one of the classes that is “in the money” (i.e., any class that could, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going concern by the restructuring expert, be reasonably presumed to receive any payment according to the ranking of liquidation priorities applicable under the Spanish Insolvency Law). The Plan can only be imposed on the shareholders if the company is in a situation of imminent or current insolvency. Following the above, a dissenting creditor belonging to a dissenting class subject to a haircut will be allowed to challenge the Plan based on, among others, a more junior class (or the equity holders) receiving any payment from –or maintaining any interest in– the debtor under the Plan (i.e., the absolute-priority rule). The Spanish Insolvency Law, however, contains certain exceptions to the absolute-priority rule (it can be derogated in order to ensure the viability of the company and that the affected creditors’ claims would not be unjustifiably prejudiced). The effects of a cross-class cram-down are subject to some practical limitations. If the Plan affects a class of claims secured by rights in rem, and that class has rejected the Plan by a majority of dissenting votes over favorable votes, any secured dissenting creditor of that class will have the right to: ###### (1) enforce the underlying security interest (which will accelerate the underlying secured claim) within a month of the Court ruling approving the Plan being published in the Public Insolvency Register (Registro _Público Concusal). If the proceeds obtained from the enforcement are:_ (a) lower than the security value of the collateral set out in the Plan, the creditor will keep those proceeds in full (security value = 90% of “reasonable value” – legally preferred claims). Any deficit will remain unsatisfied; or (b) higher than the security value collateral set out in the Plan, but lower than the original claim, the creditor will keep those proceeds in full. Any excess will be deducted from the amounts that the creditor’s unsecured part of the claim would be entitled to receive pursuant to the Plan; or ###### (2) only if expressly provided in the Plan, wait to receive a cash payment for the amount of the secured claim that is covered by the security value of the collateral within no more than 120 days. If payment is not received in a timely manner, the affected creditor will be entitled to enforce the security interest. 416 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Liquidation triggers company dissolution and the insolvency administrator stepping into the directors’ shoes. Liquidation is moreover an acceleration and cash conversion event. Spanish Insolvency Law contains certain general rules of liquidation to be followed by the insolvency trustee, which can be modified or replaced by the judge on a case-by-case basis, subject to a hearing of or report from the trustee (to be issued within 10 calendar days) (special rules).

Where a company conducts business in more than one Member State of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the relevant Courts may be limited if the company’s centre of main interest is found to be in a Member State other than its place of incorporation. The centre of main interest is presumed to be at the registered domicile of the company, but this presumption can be rebutted by a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the centre of main interest, which should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point at which this issue will be determined is at the time when the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened (for these purposes, under Spanish law, if the place of incorporation of the debtor has changed during the six months prior to the insolvency declaration, such change shall not be taken into account). The determination of where the issuer or any of the guarantors has its “centre of main interests” would be a question of fact on which the courts of the different European Union Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be noted that a limited number of final decisions have been taken in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in relation to questions of interpretation or the effects of the Insolvency Regulation throughout the European Union. Furthermore, “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. In the event Spanish Courts have jurisdiction, article 261 of the current Spanish Insolvency Law may apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by a Spanish Guarantor may be classified as “contingent” claims and no amount may be recognized until and when a default occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced, nor will they have voting rights. Special rules can apply if the guarantee is not a first demand or joint and several (solidaria) guarantee but an ordinary guarantee (fianza) and, therefore, the benefits of preference (excusión), order (orden) and division (división) apply.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The cost of an acquisition is determined as the sum of the transferred price, measured at fair value as at the acquisition date, and of the amount of the minority interest in the acquired entity. For each business combination, the Group defines whether to measure the minority interest in the acquired entity at fair value or proportionally to the minority interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. The acquisition costs are expensed in the period and classified among administrative expenses. The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs. F-80 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement—December 31, 2022 When the Group acquires a business, it classifies or designates the financial assets acquired or the liabilities assumed in accordance with the contractual terms, the economic conditions and the other pertinent conditions existing at the date of acquisition. This includes the check to determine whether an embedded derivative has to be separated from the primary contract. Any contingent consideration to be paid is recognized by the acquirer at fair value at the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration classified as equity is not subject to remeasurement and its subsequent payment is recognized with the shareholders’ equity. The change in the fair value of the contingent consideration classified as asset or liability, as a financial instrument that is in the subject of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, shall be recognised in the income statement in accordance with IFRS 9. The contingent consideration that is not included in the scope of IFRS 9 is measured at fair value at the date of the financial statements and fair value variations are recognised in the profit and loss. Goodwill is initially measured at cost represented by the excess of the aggregate consideration consisting and the amount recorded for minority interests with respect to the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by the Group. If the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the aggregate consideration, the Group verifies again whether it correctly identified all acquired assets and all assumed liabilities and it reviews the procedures used to determine the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired than the aggregate consideration, then the difference (gain) is recognized in the profit and loss. After the initial recognition, goodwill is measured at the cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of the impairment test, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, from the date of acquisition, to each cash-generating unit of the Group expected to benefit from the synergies of the aggregation, regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquired entity are assigned to these units. If goodwill was allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and the entity disposes of some of the operation within this unit, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when the gain or the loss of the disposal is determined. The goodwill associated with the disposed asset is determined on the basis of the relative values of the disposed asset and of the retained part of the cash-generating unit.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) that was issued in 2005. IFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply. The overall objective of IFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting F-14 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement (unaudited)—June 30, 2023 policies, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects. The core of IFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by: - A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach) - A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with comparative figures required.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,659,4.1** **BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL,659.1,,659.1.1,,"Business combinations are accounted using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is determined as the sum of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value as at the acquisition date, and of the amount of the minority interest in the acquired entity. For each business combination, the Group defines whether to measure the minority interest in the acquired entity at fair value or proportionally to the minority interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. The acquisition costs are expensed in the period and classified among administrative expenses. The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs. When the Group acquires a business, it classifies or designates the financial assets acquired or the liabilities assumed in accordance with the contractual terms, the economic conditions and the other pertinent conditions existing at the date of acquisition. This includes the check to determine whether an embedded derivative has to be separated from the primary contract. F-16 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement (unaudited)—June 30, 2023 Any contingent consideration to be paid is recognized by the acquirer at fair value at the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration classified as equity is not subject to remeasurement and its subsequent payment is recognized with the shareholders’ equity. The change in the fair value of the contingent consideration classified as asset or liability, as a financial instrument that is in the subject of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, shall be recognised in the income statement in accordance with IFRS 9. The contingent consideration that is not included in the scope of IFRS 9 is measured at fair value at the date of the financial statements and fair value variations are recognised in the profit and loss. Goodwill is initially measured at cost represented by the excess of the aggregate consideration transferred and the amount recorded for minority interests with respect to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by the Group. If the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the aggregate consideration, the Group verifies again whether it correctly identified all acquired assets and all assumed liabilities and it reviews the procedures used to determine the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired than the aggregate consideration, then the difference (gain) is recognized in the profit and loss. After the initial recognition, goodwill is measured at the cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of the impairment test, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, from the date of acquisition, to each cash-generating unit of the Group expected to benefit from the synergies of the aggregation, regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquired entity are assigned to these units. If goodwill was allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and the entity disposes of some of the operation within this unit, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when the gain or the loss of the disposal is determined. The goodwill associated with the disposed operations is determined on the basis of the relative values of the disposed operation and of the retained part of the cash-generating unit.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

A measurement of the fair value supposes that the sale of the asset or the transfer of the liability takes place: a) in the main market of the asset or liability; or b) in the absence of a main market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The main market or the most advantageous market must be accessible for the Group. The fair value of an asset or liability is measured adopting the assumptions that market operators would use in determining the price of the asset or liability, presuming that they act to best satisfy their own economic interest. A measurement of the fair value of a non-financial asset considers the capability of a market participant to generate economic benefits employing the asset it its highest and best use or selling it to another market participant who would employ it in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are suitable for the circumstances and for which there are sufficient available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of significant observable inputs and minimizing the use of non-observable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which the fair value is assessed or exposed in the financial statements are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy, as described below: - Level 1—The (unadjusted) listed prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities which the entity can access at the measurement date; - Level 2—Inputs other than the listed prices included in Level 1, observable directly or indirectly for the assets or for the liability; - Level 3—Measurement techniques for which the input data are not observable for the asset or for the liability. The fair value measurement is entirely classified in the same level of the fair value hierarchy in which the lowest input in the hierarchy used for the measurement is classified.

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. It is related to a lease contract if the agreement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. _Group as a lessee_ The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. F-23 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement (unaudited)—June 30, 2023 _Right-of-use assets_ The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: - Land and Buildings 2 to 24 years - Plant and machinery 2 to 8 years - Industrial and commercial equipment 2 to 5 years - Vehicles and other Assets 2 to 5 years The item “Land and Buildings” mainly include the lease contracts for the showrooms directly managed by B&B Louis Poulsen, Fashion Design Furniture and FLOS. If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in section Impairment of non-financial assets. _Lease liabilities_ At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in- substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. The Group’s lease liabilities are included in Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (see Notes 11—23). _Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_ The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option).

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,677,4.11** **FINANCIAL ASSETS,677.1,,677.1.1,,"A financial instrument is any contract originating a financial asset for an entity and a financial liability or an equity instrument for another entity. i) Financial assets _Initial recognition and measurement_ At the time of initial recognition, financial assets are classified, according to the case, on the basis of the subsequent measurement procedures, i.e. at amortized cost, at fair value recognised in other comprehensive income OCI and at the fair value recognised in the income statement. F-26 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement (unaudited)—June 30, 2023 The classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition depends on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and on the business model used by the Group for their management. Except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value recognised in the income statement, the transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group applied the practical expedient are measured at the price of the transaction determined according to IFRS 15. Please refer to the paragraph of the accounting principles Revenue from contracts with customers. For a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount of the principal to be repaid (‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’). This assessment is indicated as SPPI test and it is carried out at the instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. The Group’s business model for the management of financial assets refers to the way in which it manages its own financial assets to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether the cash flows will derive from the collection of contractual cash flows, from the sale of financial assets or from both. Financial assets classified and measured at amortized cost are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows while financial assets classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling. The purchase or the sale of a financial asset that requires its delivery within a time interval generally established by regulation or market convention (standardized or regular way trade) is recognised at the trade date, i.e. the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. _Subsequent measurement_ For the purposes of the subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: - Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with recycling of cumulated gains and losses (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income without recycling cumulated gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. _Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)_ The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following requirements are met: - the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is possession of financial assets directed at the collection of contractual cash flows and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented solely by payments of the principal and of the interest on the amount of the principal to be repaid. F-27 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement (unaudited)—June 30, 2023 Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised, modified or revalued. _Financial assets at fair value through OCI (debt instruments)_ The Group measures debt instrument assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is achieved both through the collection of contractual cash flows and through the sale of the financial assets and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented solely by payments of the principal and interest determined on the amount of the principal to be repaid. For debt instruments measured at fair value through OCI, interest income, changes due to exchange differences and impairment losses, together with reversals, are recognised in the income statement and they are calculated in the same way as the financial assets measured at amortized cost. The remaining changes in fair value are recognised in OCI. At the time of derecognition, the cumulative change in fair value recognised in OCI is reclassified in the income statement. Debt instruments of the Group measured at fair value through OCI comprise the investments in listed debt instruments included in the other non-current financial assets. Investments in equity instruments Upon initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably elect to classify its equity related investments as equity instruments recognised at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity instruments in accordance with IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation” and are not held for trading. The classification is determined for each individual instrument. The gains and losses achieved on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other revenue in the income statement when the right to payment is established, except when the Group benefits from these proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case these gains are recognised in OCI. Equity investments recognised at fair value through OCI are not subjected to impairment testing. The Group elected to classify its unlisted equity investments in this category. _Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss._ Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss. This category comprises assets held for trading, assets designated upon first recognition as financial assets at fair values with changes recognised in the income statement, or the financial assets that must mandatorily be measured at fair value. Assets held for trading are all assets acquired for their sale or their repurchase in the short term. Derivatives, including non-embedded ones, are classified as financial instruments held for trading, unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows not represented solely by payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value recognised in the income statement, regardless of the business model. In spite of the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortized cost or at fair value recognised in OCI, as described above, debt instruments can be recorded at fair value recognised in the income statement at the time of initial recognition if this entail the elimination or the significant reduction of an accounting mismatch. F-28 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement (unaudited)—June 30, 2023 Financial instruments at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value and net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year. This category includes the derivative instruments and the listed equity investments the Group has not chosen to classify at fair value through OCI. Dividends on listed equity investments are also recognised as other income in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year when the right to the payment has been established. An embedded derivative contained in a hybrid non-derivative contract, in a financial liability or in a non-financial host contract, is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a separate derivative, if: its economic characteristics and the risks associated therewith are not closely related to those of the host contract; a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would satisfy the definition as a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. A reassessment takes place only if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly changes the cash flows otherwise expected or a reclassification of a financial asset to a different category from fair value through profit or loss. An embedded derivative included in a hybrid contract that contains a financial asset is not separated from the host contract. The financial asset together with the embedded derivative is classified internally as a financial asset at fair value recognised in the income statement. Derecognition A financial asset (or, when applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognized primarily (e.g., removed from the statement of financial position of the Group) when: - the rights to receive the cash flows from the assets are extinguished, or - the Group has transferred to a third party the right to receive cash flows from the asset or assumed the contractual obligation to pay them in full and without material delay under a pass-through arrangement and (a) transferred substantially all risks and benefits of the ownership of the financial asset, or (b) did not transfer or retained substantially all the risks and benefits of the asset, but it transferred control thereof. If the Group transferred the rights to receive cash flows from an asset or executed an agreement whereby it maintains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but it assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more beneficiaries (passthrough), it assesses whether and to which extent it maintained the risks and the benefits inherent to possession. If it did not transfer or retain substantially all risks and benefits or it did not lose control thereon, the asset continues to be recognised in the financial statements of the Group to the extent of its continuing involvement in the asset. In this case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liabilities are measured so as to reflect the rights and the obligations that remain with the Group. When the continuing involvement of the entity is a guarantee on the transferred asset, the involvement is measured on the basis of the lesser between the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of the consideration received which the entity may have to repay. Impairment of financial assets Additional information about the impairment of financial losses is also provided in the note “Discretionary assessments and significant accounting estimates”. The Group records an allowance for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) for all financial assets represented by debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on F-29 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement (unaudited)—June 30, 2023 the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include the cash flows deriving from the enforcement of the collateral held or of other guarantees on the receivable which are integral to the contractual conditions. The expected credit losses are recognised in two stages. In relation to the credit exposures for which there was not significant increase of the credit risk from the initial recognition, it is necessary to recognise the losses on receivables that derive from the estimation of default events that are possible within the subsequent 12 months (12-month ECL). For the credit exposures for which there was a significant increase of the credit risk from initial recognition, it is necessary to fully recognise the expected losses that refer to the residual duration of the exposure, regardless of the time when the default event is forecast to occur (“Lifetime ECL”). For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in the calculation of the expected losses. Therefore, the Group does not monitor changes to the credit risk, but it fully recognises the lifetime expected credit loss at each reporting date. The Group defined a matrix system based on historical information, revised to consider prospective elements with reference to the specific types of debtors and their economic environment, as an instrument for determining the expected losses. For assets represented by debt instruments measured at fair value through OCI, the Group applies the simplified approach allowed for assets with low credit risk. At each reporting date of the financial statements, the Group assesses whether the debt instrument has a low credit risk using all the available information that can be obtained without excessive costs or efforts. In carrying out the assessment, the Group monitors the credit rating of the debt instrument. The financial assets represented by debt instruments held by the Group measured at fair value through OCI comprise exclusively listed bonds classified in the best categories of credit rating and, hence, they are considered investments with low credit risk. The Group’s policy is to measure the expected losses on a 12-month basis on these instruments. However, when a significant increase of the credit risk occurred, the Group fully recognises the lifetime expected credit losses. The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the contractual payments have been past due for 90 days. In some cases, the Group can also consider that a financial asset is in default when internal or external information indicate that it is improbable that the Group will fully recover the contractual amounts before considering the guarantees on the credit held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery of the contractual cash flows. A financial instrument is any contract originating a financial asset for an entity and a financial liability or an equity instrument for another entity. i) Financial assets _Initial recognition and measurement_ At the time of initial recognition, financial assets are classified, according to the case, on the basis of the subsequent measurement procedures, i.e. at amortised cost, at fair value recognised in other comprehensive income OCI and at the fair value recognised in the income statement.

F-91 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement—December 31, 2022 _Subsequent measurement_ For the purposes of the subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: - Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with reclassification of earnings and accumulated losses (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income without reversal of earnings and accumulated losses at the time of elimination (equity instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the income statement. _Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)_ The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following requirements are met: - the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is possession of financial assets directed at the collection of contractual cash flows and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented solely by payments of the principal and of the interest on the amount of the principal to be repaid. Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest criterion and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised, modified or revalued. _Financial assets at fair value recognised in the OCI (debt instruments)_ The Group measures debt instrument assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is achieved both through the collection of contractual cash flows and through the sale of the financial assets and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented solely by payments of the principal and interest determined on the amount of the principal to be repaid. For assets from debt instruments measured at fair value recognised in OCI, the interest income, the changes due to exchange differences and the impairment losses, together with write-backs, are recognised in the income statement and they are calculated in the same way as the financial assets measured at amortized cost. The remaining changes in fair value are recognised in OCI. At the time of derecognition, the cumulative change in fair value recognised in OCI is reclassified in the income statement. Assets from debt instruments of the Group measured at fair value recognised in OCI comprise the investments in listed debt instruments included in the other non-current financial assets. Investments in equity instruments Upon initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably opt to classify its own equity related investments as equity instruments recognised at fair value recognised in OCI when they meet the definition of equity instruments in accordance with IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation” and are not held for trading. The classification is determined for each individual instrument. F-92 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement—December 31, 2022 The gains and losses achieved on these financial assets are never recognised in the income statement.

Subsequent measurement For the purposes of the subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: - Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with reclassification of earnings and accumulated losses (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income without reversal of earnings and accumulated losses at the time of elimination (equity instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the income statement. Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments) The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following requirements are met: - the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is possession of financial assets directed at the collection of contractual cash flows and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented solely by payments of the principal and of the interest on the amount of the principal to be repaid. Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest criterion and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised, modified or revalued. Financial assets at fair value recognised in the OCI (debt instruments) The Group measures debt instrument assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is achieved both through the collection of contractual cash flows and through the sale of the financial assets and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented solely by payments of the principal and interest determined on the amount of the principal to be repaid. F-226 ----- International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020 For assets from debt instruments measured at fair value recognised in OCI, the interest income, the changes due to exchange differences and the impairment losses, together with write-backs, are recognised in the income statement and they are calculated in the same way as the financial assets measured at amortized cost. The remaining changes in fair value are recognised in OCI. At the time of derecognition, the cumulative change in fair value recognised in OCI is reclassified in the income statement. Assets from debt instruments of the Group measured at fair value recognised in OCI comprise the investments in listed debt instruments included in the other non-current financial assets. Investments in equity instruments Upon initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably opt to classify its own equity related investments as equity instruments recognised at fair value recognised in OCI when they meet the definition of equity instruments in accordance with IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation” and are not held for trading. The classification is determined for each individual instrument. The gains and losses achieved on these financial assets are never recognised in the income statement. Dividends are recognised as other revenue in the income statement when the right to payment was resolved, except when the Group benefits from this income as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case these gains are recognised in OCI. Equity investments recognised at fair value in OCI are not subjected to impairment testing. The Group opted to classify its own unlisted equity investments in this category. Financial assets at fair value recognised in the income statement. This category comprises assets held for trading, assets designated upon first recognition as financial assets at fair values with changes recognised in the income statement, or the financial assets that must mandatorily be measured at fair value. Assets held for trading are all assets acquired for their sale or their repurchase in the short term. Derivatives, including non-embedded ones, are classified as financial instruments held for trading, unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows not represented solely by payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value recognised in the income statement, regardless of the business model. In spite of the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortized cost or at fair value recognised in OCI, as described above, debt instruments can be recorded at fair value recognised in the income statement at the time of initial recognition if this entail the derecognition or the significant reduction of an accounting misalignment. Financial instruments at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value and net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year. This category includes the derivative instruments and the listed equity investments the Group has not chosen to classify at fair value recognised in OCI. Dividends on listed equity investments are also recognised as other income in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year when the right to the payment has been established. The embedded derivative contained in a hybrid non-derivative contract, in a financial liability or in a non-financial main contract, is separated from the main contract and accounted for as a separate derivative, if: its economic characteristics and the risks associated therewith are not closely related to those of the main contract; a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would satisfy the definition as a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value recognised in the income statement. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. A redetermination takes place only if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly changes the cash flows otherwise expected or a reclassification of a financial asset to a different category from fair value in the income statement. F-227 ----- International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020 An embedded derivative included in a hybrid contract that contains a financial asset is not separated from the host contract. The financial asset together with the embedded derivative is classified internally as a financial asset at fair value recognised in the income statement. Write-off A financial asset (or, when applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is written off in the first place (e.g., removed from the statement of financial position of the Group) when: - the rights to receive the cash flows from the assets are extinguished, or - the Group transferred to a third party the right to receive cash flows from the asset or assumed the contractual obligation to pay them in full and without delay and (a) transferred substantially all risks and benefits of the ownership of the financial asset, or (b) did not transfer or retained substantially all the risks and benefits of the asset, but it transferred control thereof. If the Group transferred the rights to receive cash flows from an asset or executed an agreement whereby it maintains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but it assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more beneficiaries (passthrough), it assesses whether and to which extent it maintained the risks and the benefits inherent to possession. If it did not transfer or retained substantially all risks and benefits or it did not lose control thereon, the asset continues to be recognised in the financial statements of the Group to the extent of its residual involvement in the asset. In this case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liabilities are measured so as to reflect the rights and the obligations that remain the Group’s. When the residual involvement of the entity is a guarantee on the transferred asset, the involvement is measured on the basis of the lesser between the amount of the asset and the maximum amount of the consider received which the entity may have to repay. Impairment of financial assets Additional information about the impairment of financial losses is also provided in the note “Discretionary assessments and significant accounting estimates”. The Group records an impairment for expected losses (expected credit loss, ‘ECL’) for all financial assets represented by debt instruments not held at fair value recognised in the income statement. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The cash flows will include the cash flows deriving from the enforcement of the collateral held or of other guarantees on the receivable which are integral parts of the contractual conditions. The expected losses are recognised in two steps. In relation to the credit exposures for which there was not significant increase of the credit risk from the initial recognition, it is necessary to recognise the losses on receivables that derive from the estimation of default events that are possible within the subsequent 12 months (12-month ECL). For the credit exposures for which there was a significant increase of the credit risk from initial recognition, it is necessary to fully recognise the expected losses that refer to the residual duration of the exposure, regardless of the time when the default event is forecast to occur (“Lifetime ECL”). For trade receivables and assets deriving from contracts, the Group applies a simplified approach in the calculation of the expected losses. Therefore, the Group does not monitor changes to the credit risk, but it fully recognises the expected loss at each reference date. The Group defined a matrix system based on historical information, revised to consider prospective elements with reference to the specific types of debtors and their economic environment, as an instrument for determining the expected losses. F-228 ----- International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020 For assets represented by debt instruments measured at fair value recognised in OCI, the Group applies the simplified approach allowed for assets with low credit risk. At each reference date of the financial statements, the Group assesses whether the debt instrument has a low credit risk using all the available information that can be obtained without excessive costs or efforts. In carrying out the assessment, the Group monitors the credit rating of the debt instrument. The financial assets represented by debt instruments held by the Group measured at fair value recognised in OCI comprise exclusively listed bonds classified in the best categories of credit rating and, hence, they are considered investments with low credit risk. The Group’s policy is to measure the expected losses in the subsequent 12 months on these instruments on an annual basis. However, when a significant increase of the credit risk occurred, the Group fully recognises the expected losses that refer to the residual duration of the exposure. The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the contractual payments have been past due for 90 days. In some cases, the Group can also consider that a financial asset is in default when internal or external information indicate that it is improbable that the Group will fully recover the contractual amounts before considering the guarantees on the credit held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery of the contractual cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

After the initial recognition, loans are measured with the amortized cost criterion using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liability is extinguished, as well as through the amortization process. The amortized cost is calculated taking into account any discount or premium on the acquisition and the fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Amortization at the effective interest rate is included among financial expenses in the statement of profit/(loss). This category generally includes interest-bearing borrowings and loans. _Derecognition_ A financial liability is written off when the obligation underlying the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.

The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset or cash-generating unit, net of selling costs, and its value in use. The recoverable value is determined by individual asset, except when the asset generates cash flows that are not broadly independent of those generated by other assets or groups of assets. If the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its recoverable amount, the asset has undergone an impairment and it is consequently written down to its recoverable amount.

The share purchase agreement was signed on April 27, 2022 by DH and Polaris Private Equity IV K/S, CIV of December 2014 K/S and certain minority sellers, as sellers, from one side, and International Design Group S.p.A. as buyer, from the other side, in relation to the acquisition of the entire share capital of Designers Company A/S (the “SPA”). The SPA provides, among others, that in addition to the purchase price, the seller would be entitled to an earn-out for an amount of DKK 80,000,000 (some Euro 10.8 million at December 31, 2022, exchange rate Dkk-Euro: 7.44) in the case the Designers’ Company Group turnover in the financial year 2023 (Jan 1, 2023 to 31 Dec. 2023) reaches the threshold of DKK 529,400,000 (calculated using the accounting principles as agreed in the SPA), equal to some Euro 71 million (exchange rate Dkk-Euro: 7.44 at December 31, 2022). Based on the information available at the date of preparation of the Group Annual report (budget 2023 of the company and the current trading in some regions), this threshold is not considered as probable and the management did not recognize any financial payable related to such Earnout in the Annual Report 2022 of the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

F-45 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement (unaudited)—June 30, 2023 The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is reported in the amount for which the instrument could be traded in a current transaction between willing parties, instead of in a forced sale or in a liquidation. To estimate fair value, the following methods and the following assumptions were used: - Long-term receivables and loans, both fixed rate and floating rate, are measured by the Group on the basis of parameters such as interest rates, specific risk factors for each Country, the individual credit rating of each customer and the risk characteristics of the financial project. Based on this evaluation, the provisions for the expected losses on these receivables are recognised in the accounting records. - The fair value of listed securities and bonds is based on the quoted price at the date of the financial statements. The fair value of unlisted instruments, such as loans from banks or other financial liabilities, obligations deriving from financial leases or as other non-current financial liabilities, is estimated through the discounting of future cash flows applying the current rates available for payables with similar terms, such as the credit risk and the remaining maturities. In addition to being sensitive to reasonably possible changes of the expected cash flows or of the discount rate, the fair value of equity instruments is also sensitive to reasonably possible changes of the growth rates.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is reported in the amount for which the instrument could be traded in a current transaction between willing parties, instead of in a forced sale or in a liquidation. To estimate fair value, the following methods and the following assumptions were used: - Long-term receivables and loans, both fixed rate and floating rate, are measured by the Group on the basis of parameters such as interest rates, specific risk factors for each Country, the individual credit rating of each customer and the characteristic risk of the financial project. Based on this measurement, the allocations for the expected losses on these receivables are recognised in the accounting records. - The fair value of listed securities and bonds is based on the listed price at the date of the financial statements. The fair value of unlisted instruments, such as loans from banks or other financial liabilities, obligations deriving from financial leases or as other non-current financial liabilities, is estimated through discounted future cash flows applying the current rates available for payables with similar terms, such as the credit risk and the remaining maturities. In addition to being sensitive to reasonably possible changes of the expected cash flows or of the discount rate, the fair value of equity instruments is also sensitive to reasonably possible changes of the growth rates.

IMPAIRMENT TEST ON GOODWILL AND ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE In accordance with IAS 36, Goodwill is not subject to amortization and it is tested for impairment at least once a year. Below all the indication of the impairment test performed on December 31, 2022. For impairment test purposes, Goodwill is allocated to the following Cash Generating Units (CGU): - FLOS - B&B - Louis Poulsen - Lumens - Designers Company The recoverable amount of each CGU has been determined based on the calculation of the value in use, in which the projections of the cash flows were those approved by the management and of a period of 4 years, as approved by the management. The calculation of the value in use is particularly sensitive to the following assumptions: - revenue trend; - marginality; - discount rate; - growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the forecast period. F-116 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement—December 31, 2022 The spread before the COVID-19 pandemic and then the conflict in Russian Ukraine constituted an external factor of potential presumption of impairment for all companies, therefore the recoverability of the goodwill allocated to the CGUs has been verified, in light of a specific analysis of the impact of the crisis on the value of fixed assets and on the basis of a the last updated business plan. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA—European Securities and Market Authority) draws attention to the need to represent the growing level of uncertainty by: - the possible use of multi-scenario techniques in determining the plans; - alternatively, adjustments to the rates used for discounting the flows; - update of the assumptions underlying the impairment tests compared to the previous tests. On this basis, the management has defined a single plan for each CGU which represents the normal and expected scenario, with reference to the period 2023-2026, with a transitional period of 2 years (2027 and 2028) aimed at reflecting an intermediate growth before the normative level, which was used for the development of impairment tests. The recoverable value of each CGU, determined on the basis of this plan, was subjected to stress tests and sensitivity analyzes which also took into consideration economic parameters and as a result of which positive results emerged. The value in use of each CGU was calculated on the basis of opportunity of cost of capital (Ka) applied to the forecast operating cash flow projections (in the range of 9.3%-10.65%) and a perpetual growth rate (g) in the range 2.25%-2.50% (1.8% in the Annual Report 2021, in the range of 1.75-2.25% in the last impairment test made on June 30, 2022). The recoverable value of the goodwill, determined on the basis of the aforementioned assumptions and valuation techniques, was estimated as the difference between the Enterprise Value deriving from the application of the DCF method and the value of the Capital Employed of each CGU. In order to calculate the recoverable amount in relation to the goodwill the management estimated the Enterprise Value of each CGU’s as at December 31, 2022 with the intrinsic approach (UDCF method). This approach is considered as a preferential method, since it makes it possible to factor in the specifics of the company with a medium term approach in defining the business plan, allowing a good level of accuracy in the future cash flow projections. This method consists in valuing a CGU based on its future cash flows. The management valuation was based on Budget 2023 and the business plan 2024-2026. However, as the future cash flows generated by a CGU’s is based on a business plan over a definite period, whilst the lifetime of the company is in theory infinite, a Terminal Value for each CGU was determined at the end of the forecast period. The Terminal value was determined at the end of transitional period on the basis of normal cash flows growing at a constant rate (g rate—in the range 2.25%-2.50% at December 31, 2022). A Transitional Period for fiscal years 2027 and 2028 was used to stabilize the main Business Plan drivers and define the normative period. To discount the free cash flows to the present value, we used the opportunity cost of capital (Ka) as reported above. In 2022, all the aforementioned CGUs reported financial results in line with budget 2022 forecasts in terms of volumes and marginality, with the exception of Lumens which over performed budget figures. Budget 2023 figures, compared to the first year of the business plan used for last impairment test show slightly lower revenues, but an higher marginality (except for Lumens, in line with previous forecasted figures). The main growth drivers at the basis of the business plan are the followings: - Enhance brand desirability, boosting creativity and product innovation as well as accelerating emerging brands; F-117 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement—December 31, 2022 - expanding geographical reach with focus on some key regions; - Pursue DTC and “brandization” journey; - digital transformation (e.g. e-commerce, new ERP’s, new CRM); - Enhance le leadership in high-end contract business. FY23-FY26 CAGR resulting from the business plan, amounting to approximately 11% on aggregate for the five CGUs subject to the impairment test of the goodwill, shows a higher growth compared to the one forecasted in the global market (some 4.7% as reported in public available market reports). The same applies also for FY23-FY26 CAGR of each single CGU (ranging from 9.5% to 17%). Such higher results are in line with the historical performance of the Group compared to the market. The management has prepared a sensitivity scenario by: - reducing the growth rate for 0.5% for the transitional period of 2027 and 2028; - reducing the marginality of 0.5% for the transitional period and the normative period; - increasing the opportunity cost of capital (Discount rate) for 0.3%; Following the results of the Impairment test, the estimated Recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill were higher than the related carrying values, therefore no write-off were necessary.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Following the results of the Impairment test, the estimated Recoverable amount of the Group’s brands were higher than the related carrying values, therefore no write-off were necessary. _Development costs includes the costs for the personnel dedicated to product development work_ carried out within the Group. These costs are amortised in three years. _Industrial patent and intellectual property rights comprises mainly costs incurred for depositing_ patents, producing software and build e-commerce websites. _Concessions, licences and trademarks and other intangible assets comprises mainly assets of the_ Parent Company referred to the production licences relating to specific product lines, costs for software licenses and the development of CRM software, costs for projects in progress and customer relationships.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial posi�on of the Group as at 31 December 2022, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Interna�onal Financial Repor�ng Standards as adopted by the European Union. ###### Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia). Our responsibili�es under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibili�es for the _Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements sec�on of our report._ We are independent of Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. in accordance with the regula�ons and standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ###### Responsibili�es of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Directors are responsible for the prepara�on of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Interna�onal Financial Repor�ng Standards as adopted by the European Union, and, within the terms provided by the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the prepara�on of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to con�nue as a going concern and, when preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assump�on, and for appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis unless they either intend to liquidate the Parent Company Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. or to cease opera�ons, or have no realis�c alterna�ve but to do so.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia), we have exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skep�cism throughout the audit. In addi�on: we have iden�fied and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detec�ng a material misstatement resul�ng from fraud is higher than for one resul�ng from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten�onal omissions, misrepresenta�ons, or the override of internal control; we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effec�veness of the Group’s internal control; we have evaluated the appropriateness of accoun�ng policies used and the reasonableness of accoun�ng es�mates and related disclosures made by the Directors; we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accoun�ng and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or condi�ons that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to con�nue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw a�en�on in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this ma�er in forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or condi�ons may cause the Group to cease to con�nue as a going concern; we have evaluated the overall presenta�on, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transac�ons and events in a manner that achieves fair presenta�on; we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial informa�on of the en��es or business ac�vi�es within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direc�on, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We have communicated with those charged with governance, iden�fied at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other ma�ers, the planned scope and �ming of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we iden�fy during our audit. F-66 ----- ###### Report on compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements Opinion pursuant to ar�cle 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legisla�ve Decree n. 39 dated 27 January 2010 The Directors of Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. are responsible for the prepara�on of the Report on Opera�ons of Interna�onal Design Group as at 31 December 2022, including its consistency with the related consolidated financial statements and its compliance with the applicable laws and regula�ons. We have performed the procedures required under audit standard SA Italia n. 720B, in order to express an opinion on the consistency of the Report on Opera�ons, with the consolidated financial statements of Interna�onal Design Group as at 31 December 2022 and on its compliance with the applicable laws and regula�ons, and in order to assess whether it contains material misstatements. In our opinion, the Report on Opera�ons is consistent with the consolidated financial statements of Interna�onal Design Group as at 31 December 2022 and comply with the applicable laws and regula�ons. With reference to the statement required by art. 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legisla�ve Decree n. 39, dated 27 January 2010, based on our knowledge and understanding of the en�ty and its environment obtained through our audit, we have no ma�ers to report.

F-84 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement—December 31, 2022 Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences, with the following exceptions: - deferred tax liabilities derive from the initial recognition of the goodwill of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not represent a business combination and, at the time of the transaction itself, influences neither the result of the financial statements nor the result for tax purposes; - the reversal of taxable temporary differences, associated with equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture, can be controlled, and it is probable that it will not occur in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised in view of all deductible temporary differences, of tax receivables and of unused tax losses that can be carried forward, to the extent to which it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available, which will allow utilisation of deductible temporary differences and of receivables and tax losses carried forward, excepting the cases in which: - the deferred tax asset connected with deductible temporary differences derive from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not represent a business combination and, at the time of the transaction itself, influences neither the result of the financial statements nor the result for tax purposes; - in the case of deductible temporary differences associated with equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent to which it is probable that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future and that there will be sufficient taxable income that allows to recover these temporary differences. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is re-examined at each reporting date and reduced to the extent to which it is no longer probable that in the future there will be sufficient taxable income to allow the receivable to be used in full or in part. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-examined at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent to which it becomes probable that taxable income will be sufficient to allow these taxes to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the tax rate expected to be applied during the year in which these assets will be realised or these liabilities will be extinguished, considering the rates in force and the ones already promulgated, or substantially in force, at the reporting date. F-85 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement—December 31, 2022 Deferred taxes relating to elements recognised outside the income statement are also recognised outside the income statement and, hence, in the shareholders’ equity or in the statement of comprehensive income, consistently with the element to which they refer. The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,740,6.3.1** **IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS,740.1,,740.1.1,,"An impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset or of a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable value, which is the higher amount between the fair value net of selling costs and its value in use. Fair value net of selling costs is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset or of a cash-generating unit in a free transaction between informed and willing parties, minus the costs of the disposal. The calculation of the value in use is based on a cash flow discounting model. Cash flows are derived from the budget of the four subsequent years and do not include restructuring activities for which the Group has not yet committed or significant future investments that will increase the results of the assets comprising the cash-generating unit being measured. The recoverable value depends markedly on the discount rate used in the cash flow discounting model, as well as on cash flows expected in the future and on the growth-rate used for extrapolation. Given the uncertainties in place, it is important that entities provide detailed information on the assumptions made, the evidence on which they are based and the impact of changing key F-105 ----- International Design Group—Consolidated Financial Statement—December 31, 2022 assumptions (sensitivity analysis). Given the level of intrinsic risk and the variability of judgments and estimates, the disclosure on the key assumptions used and the assessments made to estimate the recoverable value plays a fundamental role. The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to be a triggering event that requires an entity to carry out an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36. Entities will need to assess the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs. The key inputs used in the models with reference to the determination of value in use and fair value less cost to sell will have to be reviewed to determine any impact. Following the impairment test carried out, as per paragraph “Other Intangible asset” no triggered event has been recognized for the Group",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The allocation rates are based on the days overdue for each class of customers grouped in the various segments that have similar historical loss patterns (e.g., by geographic area, type of product, type of customer, rating and guarantees). The Group calibrates the matrix to refine the historical data on credit losses with forecast elements. Evaluating the correlation between historical default rates, expected economic conditions and ECLs is a meaningful estimate. The amount of ECL is sensitive to changes in circumstances and anticipated economic conditions.

The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates is related firstly to long-term debt with variable interest rate. The sensitivity analysis shows how a change in interest rates equal to +100bps and -100 bps on the portion of the variable interest rate of Shareholder Loan (Euro 470 million) would lead to a change in the pre-tax result not exceeding Euro 4.7 million.,N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in the exchange rates refer mainly to the operating activities of the Group (when the revenue or costs are denominated in a foreign currency) and to the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Although the Group has a strong international connotation, use of the Euro as a transnational currency for most transactions almost eliminates the risk tied to exchange rate changes. The Group is mainly exposed for positions denominated Euro, Danish Krone, Yen and US Dollar; The sensitivity analysis on exchange rates did not lead to any effects deemed significant on the Group’s economic and financial values.

YDG joined the Group on June 1[st], 2021. YDG has 200,000 active customers among end consumers, architects, designers and specifiers and generated, on 12 month basis, a turnover of approximately Euro 70 million in 2021. YDG operates through two websites, Lumens.com and YLighting.com, and distributes several well known European brands, like Artemide, Foscarini, Kartell, Muuto, Nemo, Tom Dixon as well as Group’s brands (Flos and Louis Poulsen). The acquisition is part of Design Holding’s strategy to expand its geographic reach, particularly in the attractive North American market, strengthening the Group’s digital presence and providing more services, adding value to its customers, both private and individuals. This acquisition fits into the broader plan of establishing Design Holding as the leading innovative high end design platform with a truly multi channel value proposition. The consideration paid was USD 179.2 million (net of transaction costs of USD 9.4 million) and the difference between this amount and the net liabilities acquired (USD 3.6 Million) has been allocated to trademarks (LUMENS brand) for USD 53.6 million, to other intangible assets (customer list) for USD 3.8 million, inventory USD 2.3 million (completely recycled to 2021 profit and loss statement), deferred tax liabilities for USD 16.1 million and the remainder part to goodwill (USD 139.2 million). In order to finance the above mentioned transaction, on May 19[th] 2021 the Group issued a Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (“SSFRN”) of Euro 470 million, listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg and repayable at maturity in 2026. Interest expenses are calculated on the EURIBOR plus 4.25% per year (with zero floor on Euribor). The SSFRN was admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market. The proceeds from the offering of the new Note were used to refund all the Euro 320 million outstanding Senior Secured floating rate notes (due in 2025) and to pay the acquisition of YDesign Group.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,749,4.2** **BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL,749.1,,749.1.1,,"Business combinations are accounted using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is determined as the sum of the transferred price, measured at fair value as at the acquisition date, and of the amount of the minority interest in the acquired entity. For each business combination, the Group defines whether to measure the minority interest in the acquired entity at fair value or proportionally to the minority interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. The acquisition cost are expensed in the year and classified among administrative expenses. The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs. When the Group acquires a business, it classifies or designates the financial assets acquired or the liabilities assumed in accordance with the contractual terms, the economic conditions and the other pertinent conditions existing at the date of acquisition. This includes the check to determine whether an embedded derivative has to be separated from the primary contract. Any contingent consideration to be paid is recognized by the acquirer at fair value at the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration classified as equity is not subject to remeasurement and its subsequent payment is recognized with the shareholders’ equity. The change in the fair value of the contingent consideration classified as asset or liability, as a financial instrument that is in the subject of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, shall be recognised in the income statement in accordance with IFRS 9. The contingent consideration that is not included in the scope of IFRS 9 is measured at fair value at the date of the financial statements and fair value variations are recognised in the income statement. Goodwill is initially measured at cost represented by the excess of the aggregate consideration consisting and the amount recorded for minority interests with respect to the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by the Group. If the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the aggregate consideration, the Group verifies again whether it correctly identified all acquired assets and all assumed liabilities and it reviews the procedures used to determine the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired than the aggregate consideration, then the difference (gain) is recognized in the income statement. After the initial recognition, goodwill is measured at the cost net of accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of the impairment test, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, from the date of acquisition, to each cash-generating unit of the Group expected to benefit from the synergies of the aggregation, regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquired entity are assigned to these units. If goodwill was allocated to a cash-generating unit and the entity disposes of some of the operation within this unit, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the F-150 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 carrying amount of the operation when the gain or the loss of the disposal is determined.

The fair value is the price that would be collected for the sale of an asset, or that would be paid for the transfer of a liability, in a regular transaction between market operators at the measurement date. A measurement of the fair value supposes that the sale of the asset or the transfer of the liability takes place: a) in the main market of the asset or liability; or b) in the absence of a main market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The main market or the most advantageous market must be accessible for the Group. The fair value of an asset or liability is measured adopting the assumptions that market operators would use in determining the price of the asset or liability, presuming that they act to best satisfy their own economic interest. A measurement of the fair value of a non-financial asset considers the capability of a market operator to generate economic benefits employing the asset it its maximum and best use or selling it to another market operator who would employ it in its maximum and best use. The Group uses measurement techniques that are suitable for the circumstances and for which there are sufficient available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of significant observable inputs and minimizing the use of non-observable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which the fair value is assessed or exposed in the financial statements are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy, as described below: - Level 1—The (unadjusted) listed prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities which the entity can access at the measurement date; F-152 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 - Level 2—Inputs other than the listed prices included in Level 1, observable directly or indirectly for the assets or for the liability; - Level 3—Measurement techniques for which the input data are not observable for the asset or for the liability. The fair value measurement is entirely classified in the same level of the fair value hierarchy in which the lowest input in the hierarchy used for the measurement is classified.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences, with the following exceptions: - deferred tax liabilities derive from the initial recognition of the goodwill of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not represent a business combination and, at the time of the transaction itself, influences neither the result of the financial statements nor the result for tax purposes; - the reversal of taxable temporary differences, associated with equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture, can be controlled, and it is probable that it will not occur in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised in view of all deductible temporary differences, of tax receivables and of unused tax losses that can be carried forward, to the extent to which it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available, which will allow utilisation of deductible temporary differences and of receivables and tax losses carried forward, excepting the cases in which: - the deferred tax asset connected with deductible temporary differences derive from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not represent a business combination and, at the time of the transaction itself, influences neither the result of the financial statements nor the result for tax purposes; - in the case of deductible temporary differences associated with equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent to which it is probable that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future and that there will be sufficient taxable income that allows to recover these temporary differences. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is re-examined at each reporting date and reduced to the extent to which it is no longer probable that in the future there will be sufficient taxable income to allow the receivable to be used in full or in part. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-examined at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent to which it becomes probable that taxable income will be sufficient to allow these taxes to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the tax rate expected to be applied during the year in which these assets will be realised or these liabilities will be extinguished, considering the rates in force and the ones already promulgated, or substantially in force, on the date of the financial statements. Deferred taxes relating to elements recognised outside the income statement are also recognised outside the income statement and, hence, in the shareholders’ equity or in the statement of comprehensive income, consistently with the element to which they refer. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if there is a legal right that allows to offset current tax receivables and current tax payables, and the deferred taxes refer to the same taxpayer and to the same tax authority.

These non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower between the carrying amount and their fair value net of selling costs. Selling costs are additional costs directly attributable to the sale, excluding financial costs and taxes. The condition for classification as held for sale is considered to be met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset for disposal is available for immediate sale in its current conditions. The actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is improbable that there may be significant changes in the sale or that the sale may be cancelled. The Management must be committed to the sale, whose completion should be expected within one year from the date of classification. The assets and the liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately among the current items in the financial statements. An asset for disposal qualifies as a discontinued operation if it is part of an entity that was disposed or is classified as held for sale, and: - it represents an important autonomous business unit or geographic business area, - it is part of a single coordinated plan for the disposal of an important business unit or geographic business area, - it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively in view of a resale.

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. It is related to a lease contract if the agreement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. _Group as a lessee_ The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. F-156 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 _Right-of-use assets_ The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: - Land and Buildings 2 to 24 years - Plant and machinery 2 to 8 years - Industrial and commercial equipment 2 to 5 years - Other Assets 2 to 5 years The item “Land and Buildings” mainly include the lease contracts for the showrooms directly managed by B&B Louis Poulsen, Fashion Design Furniture and FLOS. If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in section Impairment of non-financial assets. _Lease liabilities_ At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. The Group’s lease liabilities are included in Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (see Notes 11—23). _Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_ The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

After the initial recognition, intangible assets are recognised at cost net of accumulated amortisation and of any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets produced internally, except for the development costs, are not capitalised and are recognised in the income statement of the year in which they were incurred. The useful life of intangible assets is assessed as finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortised throughout their useful life and they are subjected to impairment test every time there are indications of a possible impairment loss. The amortisation period and the amortisation method of an intangible asset with definite useful life is reconsidered at least at the end of each year. Changes in the expected useful life or in the ways with which future economic benefits tied to the asset will be realised are recognised through the change of the period or of the amortisation method, depending on the case, and they are considered changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation rates of intangible assets with definite useful life are recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year in the cost category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.

F-159 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 The classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition depends on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and on the business model used by the Group for their management. Except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value recognised in the income statement, the transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group applied the practical expedient are measured at the price of the transaction determined according to IFRS 15. Please refer to the paragraph of the accounting principles (e) Revenue from contracts with customers. For a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value in OCI, where to generate cash flows that depend solely on the principal and interest on the amount of the principal to be repaid (‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’). This assessment is indicated as SPPI test and it is carried out at the instrument level. The Group’s business model for the management of financial assets refers to the way in which it manages its own financial assets to generate cash flows. The corporate model determines whether the cash flows will derive from the collection of contractual cash flows, from the sale of financial assets or from both. The purchase or the sale of a financial asset that requires its delivery within a time interval generally established by regulation or market convention (standardized or regular way trade) is recognised at the trade date, i.e. the date on which the Group committed to purchase or sell the asset. _Subsequent measurement_ For the purposes of the subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: - Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with reclassification of earnings and accumulated losses (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income without reversal of earnings and accumulated losses at the time of elimination (equity instruments); - Financial assets at fair value recognised in the income statement. _Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)_ The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following requirements are met: - the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is possession of financial assets directed at the collection of contractual cash flows and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented solely by payments of the principal and of the interest on the amount of the principal to be repaid. Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest criterion and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised, modified or revalued. F-160 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 _Financial assets at fair value recognised in the OCI (debt instruments)_ The Group measures debt instrument assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is achieved both through the collection of contractual cash flows and through the sale of the financial assets and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented solely by payments of the principal and interest determined on the amount of the principal to be repaid. For assets from debt instruments measured at fair value recognised in OCI, the interest income, the changes due to exchange differences and the impairment losses, together with write-backs, are recognised in the income statement and they are calculated in the same way as the financial assets measured at amortized cost. The remaining changes in fair value are recognised in OCI. At the time of derecognition, the cumulative change in fair value recognised in OCI is reclassified in the income statement. Assets from debt instruments of the Group measured at fair value recognised in OCI comprise the investments in listed debt instruments included in the other non-current financial assets. Investments in equity instruments Upon initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably opt to classify its own equity related investments as equity instruments recognised at fair value recognised in OCI when they meet the definition of equity instruments in accordance with IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation” and are not held for trading. The classification is determined for each individual instrument. The gains and losses achieved on these financial assets are never recognised in the income statement. Dividends are recognised as other revenue in the income statement when the right to payment was resolved, except when the Group benefits from this income as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case these gains are recognised in OCI. Equity investments recognised at fair value in OCI are not subjected to impairment testing. The Group opted to classify its own unlisted equity investments in this category. _Financial assets at fair value recognised in the income statement._ This category comprises assets held for trading, assets designated upon first recognition as financial assets at fair values with changes recognised in the income statement, or the financial assets that must mandatorily be measured at fair value. Assets held for trading are all assets acquired for their sale or their repurchase in the short term. Derivatives, including non-embedded ones, are classified as financial instruments held for trading, unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows not represented solely by payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value recognised in the income statement, regardless of the business model. In spite of the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortized cost or at fair value recognised in OCI, as described above, debt instruments can be recorded at fair value recognised in the income statement at the time of initial recognition if this entail the derecognition or the significant reduction of an accounting misalignment. Financial instruments at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value and net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year. This category includes the derivative instruments and the listed equity investments the Group has not chosen to classify at fair value recognised in OCI. Dividends on listed equity investments are F-161 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 also recognised as other income in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year when the right to the payment has been established. The embedded derivative contained in a hybrid non-derivative contract, in a financial liability or in a non-financial main contract, is separated from the main contract and accounted for as a separate derivative, if: its economic characteristics and the risks associated therewith are not closely related to those of the main contract; a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would satisfy the definition as a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value recognised in the income statement. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. A redetermination takes place only if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly changes the cash flows otherwise expected or a reclassification of a financial asset to a different category from fair value in the income statement. An embedded derivative included in a hybrid contract that contains a financial asset is not separated from the host contract. The financial asset together with the embedded derivative is classified internally as a financial asset at fair value recognised in the income statement. Write-off A financial asset (or, when applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is written off in the first place (e.g., removed from the statement of financial position of the Group) when: - the rights to receive the cash flows from the assets are extinguished, or - the Group transferred to a third party the right to receive cash flows from the asset or assumed the contractual obligation to pay them in full and without delay and (a) transferred substantially all risks and benefits of the ownership of the financial asset, or (b) did not transfer or retained substantially all the risks and benefits of the asset, but it transferred control thereof. If the Group transferred the rights to receive cash flows from an asset or executed an agreement whereby it maintains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but it assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more beneficiaries (passthrough), it assesses whether and to which extent it maintained the risks and the benefits inherent to possession. If it did not transfer or retained substantially all risks and benefits or it did not lose control thereon, the asset continues to be recognised in the financial statements of the Group to the extent of its residual involvement in the asset. In this case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liabilities are measured so as to reflect the rights and the obligations that remain the Group’s. When the residual involvement of the entity is a guarantee on the transferred asset, the involvement is measured on the basis of the lesser between the amount of the asset and the maximum amount of the consider received which the entity may have to repay. Impairment of financial assets Additional information about the impairment of financial losses is also provided in the note “Discretionary assessments and significant accounting estimates”. The Group records an impairment for expected losses (expected credit loss, ‘ECL’) for all financial assets represented by debt instruments not held at fair value recognised in the income statement. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The cash flows will include the cash flows deriving from the enforcement of the collateral held or of other guarantees on the receivable which are integral parts of the contractual conditions. F-162 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 The expected losses are recognised in two steps. In relation to the credit exposures for which there was not significant increase of the credit risk from the initial recognition, it is necessary to recognise the losses on receivables that derive from the estimation of default events that are possible within the subsequent 12 months (12-month ECL). For the credit exposures for which there was a significant increase of the credit risk from initial recognition, it is necessary to fully recognise the expected losses that refer to the residual duration of the exposure, regardless of the time when the default event is forecast to occur (“Lifetime ECL”). For trade receivables and assets deriving from contracts, the Group applies a simplified approach in the calculation of the expected losses. Therefore, the Group does not monitor changes to the credit risk, but it fully recognises the expected loss at each reference date. The Group defined a matrix system based on historical information, revised to consider prospective elements with reference to the specific types of debtors and their economic environment, as an instrument for determining the expected losses. For assets represented by debt instruments measured at fair value recognised in OCI, the Group applies the simplified approach allowed for assets with low credit risk. At each reference date of the financial statements, the Group assesses whether the debt instrument has a low credit risk using all the available information that can be obtained without excessive costs or efforts. In carrying out the assessment, the Group monitors the credit rating of the debt instrument. The financial assets represented by debt instruments held by the Group measured at fair value recognised in OCI comprise exclusively listed bonds classified in the best categories of credit rating and, hence, they are considered investments with low credit risk. The Group’s policy is to measure the expected losses in the subsequent 12 months on these instruments on an annual basis. However, when a significant increase of the credit risk occurred, the Group fully recognises the expected losses that refer to the residual duration of the exposure. The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the contractual payments have been past due for 90 days. In some cases, the Group can also consider that a financial asset is in default when internal or external information indicate that it is improbable that the Group will fully recover the contractual amounts before considering the guarantees on the credit held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery of the contractual cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value to which are added, in the cases of mortgages, loans and payables, the transaction costs directly attributable thereto. The financial liabilities of the Group comprise trade payables and other payables, mortgages and loans, including current account overdrafts and derivative financial instruments. _Subsequent measurement_ The assessment of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described above: Financial liabilities at fair value recognised in the income statement Financial liabilities recognised at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement comprise liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities initially recognised at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement. F-163 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 Liabilities held for trading are all those assumed with the intention of extinguishing them or transferring them in the short term. This category also includes the derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group which are not designated as hedging instruments in a hedging relationship defined by IFRS 9. Embedded derivatives, separated from the main contract, are classified as financial instruments held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year. Financial liabilities are designated at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement from the date of initial recognition, only if the criteria of IFRS 9 are met. At the time of the initial recognition, the Group did not designate financial liabilities at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement. _Loans and receivables_ This category is the most significant for the Group. After the initial recognition, loans are measured with the amortized cost criterion using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liability is extinguished, as well as through the amortization process. The amortized cost is calculated noting the discount or the bonus on the acquisition and the fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Amortization at the effective interest rate is included among financial expenses in the statement of profit/(loss). This category generally includes interest-bearing receivables and loans. _Write-off_ A financial liability is written off when the obligation underlying the liability is extinguished, voided or fulfilled. If an existing financial liability is replaced by another one of the same lender, at substantially different conditions, or the conditions of an existing liability are substantially amended, this exchange or amendment is treated as an accounting write-off the original liability, accompanied by the recognition of a new liability, with recognition in the statement of profit/ (liability) of the year of any differences between the carrying amounts. _Offsetting of financial instruments_ A financial asset and liability can be offset and the net balance exposed in the statement of financial position, if there is a current legal right to offset the amounts recognised in the financial accounts and there is the intention of extinguishing the net residue, or realising the asset and concurrently extinguishing the liability. _Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Initial recognition and subsequent measurement_ The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as: forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and forward commodity acquisition contracts to cover respectively, its own currency exchange rate risks, the interest rate risks and the commodity price risks. These derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and, subsequently, they are again measured at fair value. Derivatives are recorded as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. For hedge accounting purposes, there are three types of hedges: - fair value hedging in case of hedge of the exposure against changes of the fair value of the asset or liability recognised or unrecorded irrevocable commitment; F-164 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 - cash flow hedging in case of hedge of the exposure against the variability of the cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with all assets or liabilities recognised or to a highly probable planned transaction or the foreign currency risk on unrecorded irrevocable commitment; - hedge of a net investment in a foreign management.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

In this case, or in cases requiring an annual impairment test, the Group estimates the recoverable value. The recoverable value is the higher amount between the fair value of the asset or cash-generating unit, net of selling costs, and its value in use. The recoverable value is determined by individual asset, except when the asset generates cash flows that are not broadly independent of those generated by other assets or groups of assets. If the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its recoverable value, the asset has undergone an impairment and it is consequently written down to its recoverable value. In assessing the value in use, the Group discounts estimated future cash flows to present value using a discount rate before taxes, which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In calculating fair value net of selling costs, recent transactions carried out on the market are taken into account. If these transactions cannot be identified, an adequate valuation model is used. These calculations are supported by appropriate valuation multipliers, prices of listed equities for investees whose securities are traded on the market, and other available fair value indicators. The Group bases its impairment test on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, prepared separately for each cash-generating unit of the Group to which individual assets are allocated. These budges and forecast calculations cover a period of 6 years, of which 5 characterized by an analytical development of the plan and the remaining “transactional period” year characterized by a synthetic construction based on the application of a year-on-year growth rate. The decision to adopt a plan period of more than 5 years is aimed at representing the development actions implemented by management and their recoverability. For acquisitions occurred in proximity to the end of the year, the group could determine the recoverable value calculating the fair value of the asset to be evaluated. Impairment losses of operating assets, including the impairment losses of inventories, are recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year in the cost categories consistent with the destination of the asset that underwent the impairment loss. Fixed assets previously revalued are F-165 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 an exception, if the revaluation was recognised among the other comprehensive income. In these cases, the impairment loss is in turn recognised among the other comprehensive income up to the previous revaluation. For assets other than goodwill, at each reporting date the Group assesses the existence of any indications that the previously recognised impairment losses no longer apply (or were reduced) and, if there are such indications, it estimates the recoverable value of the asset or of the CGU. The value of an asset that was previously written down may be restored only if there were changes in the assumptions on which the calculation of the determined recoverable value was based, subsequent to the recognition of the last impairment loss. The write-back may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised in previous years. The write-back is recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year unless the asset is recognised at the written-back value, in which case the write-back is treated as a revaluation increase.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,776,4.20** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS,776.1,,776.1.1,,"Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of sharebased payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions). _Equity-settled transactions_ The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model. That cost is recognized in employee benefits expense, together with a corresponding increase in equity (other capital reserves), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period. Service and non-market performance conditions are not considered when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement is non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions. When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognized is the grant date fair value of the unmodified award, provided the original vesting terms of the award F-167 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 are met. An additional expense, measured as at the date of modification, is recognized for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee. Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss. **5** **CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCOSURES 5.1** **NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS** The Group applied for the first-time certain standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. **INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM—PHASE 2: AMENDEMENTS TO IFRS, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4, AND IFRS 16** The amendments provide temporary reliefs which address the financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate (IBOR) is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free interest rate (RFR). The amendments include the following practical expedients: - A practical expedient to require contractual changes, or changes to cash flows that are directly required by the reform, to be treated as changes to a floating interest rate, equivalent to a movement in a market rate of interest; - Permit changes required by IBOR reform to be made to hedge designations and hedge documentation without the hedging relationship being discontinued; - Provide temporary relief to entities from having to meet the separately identifiable requirement when an RFR instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component. These amendments have no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it does not have any interest rate hedge relationships. **AMENDEMENTS TO IFRS 16 COVID-19 RELATED RENT CONCESSIONS** On 28 May 2020, the IASB issued Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions—amendment to IFRS 16 Leases. The amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change was not a lease modification. The amendment was intended to apply until 30 June 2021, but as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is continuing, on 31 March 2021, the IASB extended the period of application of the practical expedient to 30 June 2022.

This amendment clarifies how a Company must classify payables and other financial liabilities as current or non-current in specific circumstances by introducing the requirement to classify a liability as “current” where the entity has the right to defer their settlement for at least 12 months following the balance sheet date. This change will be applicable starting January 1, 2023. In June 2021, the IASB decided to postpone the first effective date of the amendment to no earlier than January 1, 2024, postponing the determination of the transition requirements for this amendment to a subsequent meeting.

The amendments aim to help entities provide information on the most useful accounting policies by replacing the obligation for entities to provide their own “significant” accounting policies with the obligation to disclose their “relevant” accounting policies; in addition, guidelines are added on how entities apply the concept of relevance in making decisions regarding disclosure on accounting principles. The amendments to IAS 1 are applicable starting from financial years starting on or after January 1, 2023, early application is permitted.

Under the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts on the balance sheet subject to measurement uncertainty”. - Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Board clarifies that a change in the accounting estimate that results from new information or new developments is not the correction of an error. Also, the effects of a change in an input or measurement technique used to develop an accounting estimate are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of errors from previous periods. - A change in an accounting estimate may affect only the current year’s profit or loss, or both the current and future year’s profit or loss. The effect of the change relating to the current year is recognized as income or expense in the current year. Any effect on future periods is recognized as income or expense in such future periods.

The amendments were issued in response to an IFRIC recommendation. Research conducted by the Committee indicated that views differed as to whether the recognition exemption applied to transactions, such as leases, that lead to the recognition of an asset and a liability. These differing views have led entities to account for deferred taxes on such transactions in different ways, reducing the comparability of their balance sheets. The Board expects that the amendments will reduce the diversity in reporting and align the accounting for deferred taxes on such transactions with the general principle of IAS 12 of recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences. An entity applies changes to transactions that occur at the beginning or after the beginning of the first comparative period presented. Furthermore, at the beginning of the first comparative period presented, it recognizes the deferred taxes for all temporary differences relating to leasing and disposal obligations and recognizes the cumulative effect of the initial application of the changes as an adjustment to the opening balance of the profits brought to new (or other components of equity, as the case may be) on that date.

The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate (e.g., construction of significant leasehold improvements or significant customization to the leased asset). The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of plant and machinery with shorter non-cancellable period (i.e., three to five years). The Group typically exercises its option to renew for these leases because there will be a significant negative effect on production if a replacement asset is not readily available. The renewal periods for leases of plant and machinery with longer non-cancellable periods (i.e., 10 to 15 years) are not included as part of the lease term as these are not reasonably certain to be exercised. In addition, the renewal options for leases of motor vehicles are not included as part of the lease term because the Group typically leases motor vehicles for not more than five years and, hence, is not exercising any renewal options. Furthermore, the periods covered by termination options are included as part of the lease term only when they are reasonably certain not to be exercised.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

The allocation rates are based on the days overdue for each class of customers grouped in the various segments that have similar historical loss patterns (e.g., by geographic area, type of product, type of customer, rating and guarantees). The Group calibrates the matrix to refine the historical data on credit losses with forecast elements. Evaluating the correlation between historical default rates, expected economic conditions and ECLs is a meaningful estimate.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA—European Securities and Market Authority) draws attention to the need to represent the growing level of uncertainty by: - the possible use of multi-scenario techniques in determining the plans; - alternatively, adjustments to the rates used for discounting the flows; F-182 ----- International Design Group Consolidated Financial Statements of December 31, 2021 - update of the assumptions underlying the impairment tests at 31.12.2021 compared to the previous tests. On this basis, the management has defined a single plan for each CGU (approved by the Board of Directors) which represents the normal and expected scenario, with reference to the period 2022-2027 which was used for the development of impairment tests. The recoverable value of each CGU, determined on the basis of this plan, was subjected to stress tests and sensitivity analyzes which also took into consideration economic parameters and as a result of which positive results emerged. The value in use of each CGU was calculated on the basis of opportunity of cost of capital (Ka) applied to the forecast operating cash flow projections (in the range of 8.8%-10.8%) and a perpetual growth rate (g) by 1.8% (1.5% for 2020). The recoverable value of the goodwill, determined on the basis of the aforementioned assumptions and valuation techniques, was estimated as the difference between the Enterprise Value deriving from the application of the DCF method and the value of the Capital Employed of each CGU. In order to calculate the recoverable amount in relation to the goodwill the management estimated the Enterprise Value of each CGU’s as at 31 December 2021 with the intrinsic approach (UDCF method). This approach is considered as a preferential method, since it makes it possible to factor in the specifics of the company with a medium term approach in defining the business plan, allowing a good level of accuracy in the future cash flow projections. This method consists in valuing a CGU based on its future cash flows. The management valuation was based on Budget 2022 and the business plan 2023-2026. However, as the future cash flows generated by a CGU’s is based on a business plan over a definite period, whilst the lifetime of the company is in theory infinite, a Terminal Value for each CGU was determined at the end of the forecast period. The Terminal value was determined at the end of transitional period on the basis of normal cash flows growing at a constant rate (g rate—1.8% at December 31, 2021). A Transitional Period for fiscal year 2027 was used to stabilize the main Business Plan drivers and define the normative period. To discount the free cash flows to the present value, we used the opportunity cost of capital (Ka) as reported above. The management has prepared a sensitivity scenario reducing the growth rate for the transitional period of 2027 from 3% to 1.8% and reducing the marginality of 0.5%. Following the results of the Impairment test, the estimated Recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill were higher than the related carrying values (high headroom), therefore no write-off were necessary.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial posi�on of the Group as at 31 December 2020, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Interna�onal Financial Repor�ng Standards as adopted by the European Union. ###### Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia). Our responsibili�es under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibili�es for the Audit of the Consolidated _Financial Statements sec�on of our report._ We are independent of Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. in accordance with the regula�ons and standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ###### Responsibili�es of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Directors are responsible for the prepara�on of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Repor�ng Standards as adopted by the European Union, and, within the terms provided by the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the prepara�on of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to con�nue as a going concern and, when preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assump�on, and for appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis unless they either intend to liquidate the Parent Company Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. or to cease opera�ons, or have no realis�c alterna�ve but to do so. The statutory audit commi�ee (“Collegio Sindacale”) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law, for overseeing the Group’s financial repor�ng process. EY S.p.A.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia), we have exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skep�cism throughout the audit. In addi�on: we have iden�fied and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detec�ng a material misstatement resul�ng from fraud is higher than for one resul�ng from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten�onal omissions, misrepresenta�ons, or the override of internal control; we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effec�veness of the Group’s internal control; we have evaluated the appropriateness of accoun�ng policies used and the reasonableness of accoun�ng es�mates and related disclosures made by the Directors; we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accoun�ng and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or condi�ons that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to con�nue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw a�en�on in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this ma�er in forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or condi�ons may cause the Group to cease to con�nue as a going concern; we have evaluated the overall presenta�on, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transac�ons and events in a manner that achieves fair presenta�on; we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial informa�on of the en��es or business ac�vi�es within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direc�on, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We have communicated with those charged with governance, iden�fied at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other ma�ers, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we iden�fy during our audit. ###### Report on compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements Opinion pursuant to ar�cle 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legisla�ve Decree n. 39 dated 27 January 2010[1] 1 The Report on Operations of International Design Group as at 31 December 2020 is not included in this Offering Memorandum. F-202 ----- The Directors of Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. are responsible for the prepara�on of the Report on Opera�ons of Interna�onal Design Group as at 31 December 2020, including its consistency with the related consolidated financial statements and its compliance with the applicable laws and regula�ons. We have performed the procedures required under audit standard SA Italia n. 720B, in order to express an opinion on the consistency of the Report on Opera�ons, with the consolidated financial statements of Interna�onal Design Group as at 31 December 2020 and on its compliance with the applicable laws and regula�ons, and in order to assess whether it contains material misstatements. In our opinion, the Report on Opera�ons is consistent with the consolidated financial statements of Interna�onal Design Group as at 31 December 2020 and comply with the applicable laws and regula�ons. With reference to the statement required by art. 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legisla�ve Decree n. 39, dated 27 January 2010, based on our knowledge and understanding of the en�ty and its environment obtained through our audit, we have no ma�ers to report.

Control is obtained when the Group is exposed or is entitled to variable returns, deriving from its relations with the investee entity and, at the same time, can affect such returns by exercising its power over that entity. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: - power over the investee entity (i.e., it owns valid rights that currently entitle it to manage the significant activities of the investee entity); - exposure or rights to variable returns deriving from the relationships with the investee entity; - the ability to exercise its own power on the investee entity to affect the amount of its returns. When the Group holds less than the majority of the voting rights (or similar rights) it must consider all relevant facts and circumstances to establish whether it controls the investee entity, including: - Contractual agreements with other holders of voting rights; - Rights deriving from contractual agreements; - Voting rights and potential voting rights of the Group. The Group reconsiders whether or not it has control of an investee if the facts and circumstances indicate that changes have occurred in one or more of the three elements with relevance for the purposes of the definition of control. The consolidation of a subsidiary starts when the Group obtains control thereof and ceases when the Group loses control. The assets, liabilities, revenues and costs of the subsidiary acquired or sold during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date on which the Group obtains control until the date on which the Group no longer exercises control of the company. The profit/(loss) for the year and each of the other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the parent company and to minority interests, even if this implies that minority interests have a negative balance. When necessary, the appropriate adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries, to assure compliance with the group’s accounting policies. All assets and liabilities, the shareholders’ equity, the revenues, costs and intercompany cash flows relating to transactions between group entities are fully eliminated in the consolidation phase. Changes in the shareholdings in a subsidiary that do not entail a loss of control are recognized in the shareholders’ equity. If the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it must eliminate the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, minority interests and the other shareholders’ equity components, while any F-214 ----- International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020 profit or loss is recognised in the income statement.

Current taxes relating to items recognized directly in the shareholders’ equity are also recognized in the shareholders’ equity and not in the statement of the profit/(loss) for the period.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,801,4.7.2** **DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,801.1,,801.1.1,,"Deferred taxes are calculated applying the “liability method” to temporary differences at the date of the financial statements between the tax values of the assets and liabilities and the corresponding financial statement values. F-219 ----- International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020 Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences, with the following exceptions: - deferred tax liabilities derive from the initial recognition of the goodwill of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not represent a business combination and, at the time of the transaction itself, influences neither the result of the financial statements nor the result for tax purposes; - the reversal of taxable temporary differences, associated with equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture, can be controlled, and it is probable that it will not occur in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised in view of all deductible temporary differences, of receivables and of unused tax losses that can be carried forward, to the extent to which it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available, which will allow utilisation of deductible temporary differences and of receivables and tax losses carried forward, excepting the cases in which: - the deferred tax asset connected with deductible temporary differences derive from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not represent a business combination and, at the time of the transaction itself, influences neither the result of the financial statements nor the result for tax purposes; - in the case of deductible temporary differences associated with equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent to which it is probable that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future and that there will be sufficient taxable income that allows to recover these temporary differences. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is re-examined at each reporting date and reduced to the extent to which it is no longer probable that in the future there will be sufficient taxable income to allow the receivable to be used in full or in part. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-examined at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent to which it becomes probable that taxable income will be sufficient to allow these taxes to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the tax rate expected to be applied during the year in which these assets will be realised or these liabilities will be extinguished, considering the rates in force and the ones already promulgated, or substantially in force, on the date of the financial statements. Deferred taxes relating to elements recognised outside the income statement are also recognised outside the income statement and, hence, in the shareholders’ equity or in the statement of comprehensive income, consistently with the element to which they refer. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if there is a legal right that allows to offset current tax receivables and current tax payables, and the deferred taxes refer to the same taxpayer and to the same tax authority.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703
148,Final Offerings 2023.md,802,4.8** **ASSETS HELD FOR DISPOSAL,802.1,,802.1.1,,"The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale/disposal if their carrying amount will be recovered mainly with a sale transaction instead of through their continuous use. These non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower between the carrying amount and their fair value net of selling costs. Selling costs are additional costs directly attributable to the sale, excluding financial costs and taxes. The condition for classification as held for sale is considered to be met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset for disposal is available for immediate sale in its current conditions. The actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is improbable that there may be significant changes in the sale or that the sale may be cancelled. The Management must be committed to the sale, whose completion should be expected within one year from the date of classification. The assets and the liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately among the current items in the financial statements. An asset for disposal qualifies as a discontinued operation if it is part of an entity that was disposed or is classified as held for sale, and: - it represents an important autonomous business unit or geographic business area, - it is part of a single coordinated plan for the disposal of an important business unit or geographic business area, - it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively in view of a resale.

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,803,4.9.1** **LEASING,803.1,,803.1.1,,"The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. _Group as a lessee_ The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. _Right-of-use assets_ The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial F-222 ----- International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020 direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: - Land and Buildings 2 to 24 years - Plant and machinery 2 to 8 years - Industrial and commercial equipment 2 to 5 years - Other Assets 2 to 5 years The item “Land and Buildings” mainly include the lease contracts for the showrooms directly managed by B&B and Flos. If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in section Impairment of non-financial assets. _Lease liabilities_ At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. The Group’s lease liabilities are included in Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (see Notes 11—23). _Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_ The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

148,Final Offerings 2023.md,808,6.2.1** **IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS,808.1,,808.1.1,,"An impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset or of a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable value, which is the higher amount between the fair value net of selling costs and its value in use. Fair value net of selling costs is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset or of a cash-generating unit in a free transaction between informed and willing parties, minus the costs of the disposal. The calculation of the value in use is based on a cash flow discounting model. Cash flows are derived from the budget of the four subsequent years and do not include restructuring activities for which the Group has not yet committed or significant future investments that will increase the results of the assets comprising the cash-generating unit being measured. The recoverable value depends markedly on the discount rate used in the cash flow discounting model, as well as on cash flows expected in the future and on the growth-rate used for extrapolation. Given the uncertainties in place, it is important that entities provide detailed information on the assumptions made, the evidence on which they are based and the impact of changing key assumptions (sensitivity analysis). Given the level of intrinsic risk and the variability of judgments and estimates, the disclosure on the key assumptions used and the assessments made to estimate the recoverable value plays a fundamental role. The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to be a triggering event that requires an entity to carry out an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36. Entities will need to assess the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs. The key inputs used in the models with reference to the determination of value in use and fair value less cost to sell will have to be reviewed to determine any impact. Following the impairment test carried out, as per paragraph “Other Intangible asset” no triggered event has been recognized for the group.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

F-239 ----- International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020 The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is reported in the amount for which the instrument could be traded in a current transaction between willing parties, instead of in a forced sale or in a liquidation. To estimate fair value, the following methods and the following assumptions were used: - Long-term receivables and loans, both fixed rate and floating rate, are measured by the Group on the basis of parameters such as interest rates, specific risk factors for each Country, the individual credit rating of each customer and the characteristic risk of the financial project. Based on this measurement, the allocations for the expected losses on these receivables are recognised in the accounting records. - The fair value of listed securities and bonds is based on the listed price at the date of the financial statements. The fair value of unlisted instruments, such as loans from banks or other financial liabilities, obligations deriving from financial leases or as other non-current financial liabilities, is estimated through discounted future cash flows applying the current rates available for payables with similar terms, such as the credit risk and the remaining maturities. In addition to being sensitive to reasonably possible changes of the expected cash flows or of the discount rate, the fair value of equity instruments is also sensitive to reasonably possible changes of the growth rates. The valuation requires the use, by the Management of non-observable input data, illustrated previously. The Management regularly defines a range of reasonably possible alternatives for these significant non observable input data and it determines their impact on total fair value.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

F-242 ----- International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020 For impairment test purposes, Goodwill is allocated to the following Cash Generating Units, CGUs: Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen. The recoverable amount of each CGU (FLOS, B&B and Louis Poulsen) has been determined based on the calculation of the value in use, in which the projections of the cash flows were those approved by the management and of a period of 7 years, as approved by the management. The calculation of the value in use is particularly sensitive to the following assumptions: - revenue trend; - marginality; - discount rate; - growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the forecast period. COVID-19 pandemic spread constitutes an external factor of potential presumption of impairment for all companies, therefore the recoverability of the goodwill allocated to the three CGUs has been verified, in light of a specific analysis of the impact of the crisis on the value of fixed assets and on the basis of a business plan updated at the beginning of 2021. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA—European Securities and Market Authority) draws attention to the need to represent the growing level of uncertainty by: - the possible use of multi-scenario techniques in determining the plans; - alternatively, adjustments to the rates used for discounting the flows; - update of the assumptions underlying the impairment tests at 31.12.2020 compared to the previous tests. On this basis, the management has defined a single plan for each CGU (approved by the Board of Directors) which represents the normal and expected scenario, with reference to the period 20212027 and which was used for the development of impairment tests. The recoverable value of each CGU, determined on the basis of this plan, was subjected to stress tests and sensitivity analyzes which also took into consideration economic parameters and as a result of which positive results emerged. The value in use of each CGU was calculated on the basis of a cost of asset (Ka) applied to the forecast operating cash flow projections of 8%, unchanged from last year, and a perpetual growth rate (g) by 1.5%, down from the previous year when it was 2%. The recoverable value determined on the basis of the aforementioned assumptions and valuation techniques was higher than the book value of the assets allocated to the three CGUs, consequently the carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2020 is considered recoverable The management has prepared an alternative scenario to verify the effects of this latter on the assets’ value. For Flos, the headroom emerged is 71.8 million Euros. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been prepared, considering the last two years of the plan and has previewed a reduction of the revenues of 1%, and a reduction of the Ebitda margin of 0,5%. In this scenario the headroom emerged was 49.7 million Euros. Therefore, the recoverable value of Goodwill was in any case higher than the book value. For B&B, the headroom emerged is 174,3 million Euros. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been prepared, considering the last two years of the plan and has previewed a reduction of the revenues of 1%, and a reduction of the Ebitda margin of 0,5%. In this scenario the headroom emerged was 146.7 million Euros. Therefore, the recoverable value of Goodwill was in any case higher than the book value. For LP, the headroom emerged is 121,1 million Euros. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been prepared, considering the last two years of the plan and has previewed a reduction of the F-243 ----- International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020 revenues of 1%, and a reduction of the Ebitda margin of 0,5%. In this scenario the headroom emerged was 113,3 million Euros. Therefore, the recoverable value of Goodwill was in any case higher than the book value. Furthermore, the management has prepared an alternative valuation scenario (stress test) which provides for the determination of the recoverable amount per CGU over a period of a 5-year plan, in line with the dictates of the accounting standard; no impairment indicators emerged from this analysis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Rent concessions can include rent holidays or rent reductions for a period, possibly followed by increased rent payments in future periods. Applying the requirements in IFRS 16 for changes to lease payments, particularly assessing whether the rent concessions are lease modifications and applying the required accounting, could be practically difficult in the current environment. The objective of the amendment is to provide lessees that have been granted Covid-19 related rent concessions with practical relief, while still providing useful information about leases to users of the financial statements. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification. The practical expedient applies only to rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. A lessee that applies the practical expedient discloses that it has applied the practical expedient to all rent concessions that meet the conditions for the practical expedient or, if not applied to all such rent concessions, information about the nature of the contracts to which it has applied the practical expedient. In addition, a lessee discloses the amount recognized in profit or loss to reflect changes in lease payments that arise from such rent concessions to which the lessee has applied the practical expedient. Entities will need to assess whether the regulator in their jurisdiction allows the use of the relief and the date from which it is effective. The Group during the year, recorded reductions in leasing installments of approximately euro 94 thousand and mainly for the stores of Flos SpA and Flos France.",N/A,as_expected,2023,703

Hence, the employee severance indemnity is determined as a result of the application of an actuarial model based on several demographic and economic assumptions.
